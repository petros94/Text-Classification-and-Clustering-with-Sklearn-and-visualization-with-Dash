34,34,5941,"I recently got a pair from a friend who was going to throw his pair away when he got a new one, and I fell in love with the Low Top style Chucks.  Before this, I had always worn the High Tops and never thought anything about getting the Low Tops. They are comfortable and match almost everything you throw at it. I get compliments every day when I wear them! They never go out of style, and only look better the older they get. These shoes last a very long time, and I am sure it will be another year or two before I have to buy myself a pair. I would recommend these shoes for anyone who loves staying fashionable and trendy for a cheap price.",clothing

The shoes arrived rather quickly - however - even before I pulled back the last layer of packaging tissue in the shoe box I could tell they were the wrong color. (Too dark to be pink.) I was sent the Eggplant selection by mistake - or at least I'm hoping that's the case. The colors couldn't be more different. One is supposedly a bright raspberry like pink - while the eggplant is very much the color of the vegetable. A dark rich purple (nearly black in some light.) Luckily I liked the color enough to just keep the shoes. But be mindful when placing your order that you might end up with the ole switch-a-roo pulled on you.",clothing

There it is the regular shirt, and there are the stitched slits on the side of the breast parts, that are stretchy enough you open up for feeding your little one.

The longer pieces of material that are used to tie whatever way you want to tie them are also very stretchy, and perfect for breastfeeding mothers, just in case you have a little bit of a milk leakage , we all know that happens.

I like the shirt, I think it's perfect for breastfeeding mothers, or for pregnant women who need a little bit of comfort because this shirt isn't tight, it won't irritate your delicate skin.

149,149,7229,"I'm one of the nerds that wanted a pair of 10th Doctor Who shoes...and I'm really pleased with this purchase. My mom's cool enough that she knew I wanted them but knew I did my own research about where to buy them, so she gave me forty bucks and the go-ahead-mom-nod for my birthday present :)

First of all, never buy your first pair of converse offline unless you've tried them on in stores before. Yes, they're a thin material, yes, the sole is flat and not cushioned. Some people like the hi top style, and some people feel it digs into their ankles. They're converse. Some people love them, some people don't.

The ones I got were great. Brand-spankin' new, great color, real chucks, an extra pair of laces (which were red, and I find that a bit of an odd choice, but I really don't care). I wear a size 8.5 in women's and 6.5 in men's, and converse fit me very true to size, so that's what I ordered, and they're perfect. Some people seem to feel they run a bit slim, but that's why I urge you to try a pair on in stores, just for fit, before ordering your particular style/color off of any website.

I highly recommend the seller. I had no problems ordering or receiving, and the shoes came a few days before expected. Love these shoes <3",clothing

151,151,985,"For years I carried a Land's End Square Rigger, which at the time was a great canvas attache.
Got away from those because I wanted something classier, in leather.
After many years i realized that leather was heavy so went to get another one, but Land's End had changed and the reviews of the new bags turned me away.

Wanted something lightweight with loads of pockets, accessible from the top, with a handle as well as shoulder straps, with a rear slip pocket and could be stuffed without breaking the zipper.
Made a few mistakes along the way, and somehow came across this bag.

I like it more than my old Land's End bags.
There are two large pockets instead of the one, with access from the top for one and a flap cover for the other.
The flap can be easily opened with one hand while on the shoulder.
The organizational possibilities are outstanding due to the pocket arrangement and the number of them.
It's lightweight, not overly large, and can be stuffed without worry.
Can carry it by the handle without closing the flap cover.

It's not canvas, but I like the material, which should show less wear and tear in the long run.
Not crazy about the color, but can live with it.
Marking it down 1 star because of it.

Happy with the bag.",clothing

183,183,3912,"I admit that I am not as diligent as getting sized for a bra as often as we women should be.  I needed a strapless bra for a friend's wedding and went into a lingerie store to get one.  The measured me and announced I was a 34DD.  WHAT?!  I have never been a Double anything.. much less a D.  I will admit that for about 5 milliseconds I had a mixture of shock, and a strange sense of pride, but I digress...

With the friend's wedding looming near, I headed back to a workout schedule that had long been abandoned.  I went to bootcamp and trampoline fitness class and within 3 seconds of starting squat jumps, I was mortified that my DDs were flying all over the place.  Oh yeah.. I forgot to get a new sports bra since my girls grew exponentially!

I searched high and low on the internet, and this bra topped many lists as the best for larger-busted women.  I was hesitant to pay $64 for a sports bra, but SOMETHING needed to be done!  Thankfully, Amazon is quick with delivery (seriously, ya'll - the Prime membership is TOTALLY worth it).

I received it quickly and the first thing I did was try it on.  I put my arms through, and thought ""There is no way this thing is going to close up!  There must have been a mistake... Did I get the right size? Should I have ordered the next size up?""

The truth is it just looks like it won't fit, but it will.  Hook the bottom 2 first, adjust the girls a bit, and it should be easier to hook up the others up the front.

After that done, I jumped around, did some squat jumps, some burpees, and any other exercise that I could think of that extremely embarrassed me only days before because of my old sports bra.  NO MOVEMENT WHATSOEVER.  I was amazed.

The true test, I thought, would be making it through a trampoline fitness class since we are literally jumping up and down in different ways for an hour straight.  I am so impressed with this bra!  I am definitely going to buy more!

Cliffs Notes version of this item review:
1) It's awesome!  Don't even think twice, just buy it.
2) Go to the Enell website to find your size.  I used their measurements and it fit perfectly
3) To put it on, don't freak out.  Start with the bottom 2 hooks, adjust the girls, and hook the others.  Ta-Da!  You're ready to run or jump or whatever it is you want to do without your girls flying all over the place",clothing

202,2,3430,"I haven't read any of Coupland's other books, but I certainly will after reading Microserfs. This is fiction that tries to give the reader some kind of feeling for working in computers in the early 1990s. Geeks think and behave differently than most people, and Coupland and this is the first work of fiction I've read from the point of view of a geek. He gets into some interesting stuff with Bug having to define his own identity late in his life; this turns out to be a good thing, because if he wasn't gay then he could have kept going on in his life without ever having to evaluate himself as a sexual being, just being carried by a crappy inertia. An issue to which Coupland returns throughout the book is how now we have less free identity. In some neighborhoods every house is different, and kids playing hide and seek with their friends might have secret crevasses no one knows about. In other neighborhoods there are a handful of moulds for a house, they're all made out of the same material, and perhaps you get to choose what color the living room walls will be and whether you have hardwood floors or carpeting. Being able to follow an existing belief system takes a huge amount of mental burden off you. The writing is sprinkled with cute bon mots like, ""I don't even deserve the honor of calling myself carbon-based, let alone silicon-based-- maybe I'm based on one of those useless elements like boron that don't do anything."" Part of why I liked this book so much is probably because it's about a second phase of having to define yourself firmly as an adult in your late 20s or early 30s, after the initial phase of self definition that happens in adolescence (and perhaps another one in between in the early 20s), and I am myself in my late 20s...",books
203,3,7783,"I'm an avid fan of Crichton. After 8 of his books I'm quite familiar with his formula (a specially selected group of scientists exploit the exciting aspects of a new high technology before a disaster strikes i.e. Sphere, Jurassic Park, Timeline,etc.) Yet, this novel is just as thought provoking, if not more so! This is the first one I've read that makes computer science/algorithms the main tech (heck, there's even a snippet of source code), although it is heavily mixed in with evolutionary biology, and the result is astonishing but believable because it is applicable for the layperson. We live in a world of artificial intelligence and algorithms - social media, stock market automated trading, etc. They are designed to learn. It's not hard to imagine what craziness could happen to these systems if they behaved, well, exactly as designed!

This is not just a high concept, there is a lot of action - what a visually striking movie this would be! I am stuck with an image of a [SPOILER: billions of microscopic robots patterned to look like a human face flung to the far corners of a room, so that the room is textured with an animated human].

210,10,4482,"Once upon a time, it was still questionable whether the blimp or the airplane would come to dominate the skies.  The airplane won, of course, but not before the blimps' fans had produced a fair amount of dirigible-centered science fiction, perhaps most notably Rudyard Kipling's ""With the Night Mail.""  Kenneth Oppel brilliantly resurrects this previously deceased branch of sf with Airborn, which is reminiscent of boys' adventure serials like Great Marvel, as well as the works of Jules Verne, Rudyard Kipling, and perhaps most importantly, Robert Louis Stevenson.

To make this world of airships possible, these stories often optimistically imagined gasses lighter than hydrogen.  Oppel invents such a gas for the world of Airborn and playfully labels it ""hydrium,"" adding in a super-light, super-strong material called alumiron.  The precise era of this fantasy world is uncertain, of course, because it is a projected future of the Victorian age rather than a past or future of the real world.  The impressive technology of the airships and ornithopters is blended with an old-fashioned decor, communication technology, and admirable chivalry.  Though science fiction is typically used to envision the future, Oppel taps its other major ability, one that has in recent days come increasingly to the fore:  it's ability to re-imagine the past.

Airborn, like the great boys' adventure that it is, has all the well-known elements.  The protagonist is a plucky, self-capable, likeable youth of the Stevenson variety.  The story features the ravings of an eccentric scientist on his death bed, the appearance of his comely granddaughter, pirates, narrow escapes, final confrontations, and swashbuckling in the grand tradition of swashbuckling.  Oppel's greatest achievement is not in merely moving these elements from the ocean to eight hundred feet above it, but in making the well-known plot points and characters immediate and fresh.  He carefully balances character, story development, and the technical details involved in flying an airship.  Whereas some of the early airship stories could bog down in descriptions of physics or weather, Oppel carefully cuts a straight path between the pitfalls of excessive exposition and excessive action sequences.  He has quite possibly produced today's Treasure Island, which is no small accomplishment.

The Cat in the Hat shows up and invites himself in the house, where he makes himself at home by eating cake in the bathtub.  When he exits the tub, there is a pink ring that needs to be cleaned up.  The cat uses various objects and surfaces in the house to clean the ring, but it eventually winds up outside in the snow.

The Cat enlists the help of other cats that are under his hat to ""kill the mess"", using pop guns.  The more the cats shoot, the more the spots spread.  There's an illustration of pink-tinged snow covering the ground, the house, and even a snowman.  This picture, coupled with the words ""Kill those spots!  Kill the mess!"", just comes across as a little violent and gory to me.

Just plain weird story.  Not a favorite of mine, by any means.",books

221,21,8124,"Well, MC is allowed to write a so-so book every once in awhile - and this is it. If anything, I would normally be accused of going too easy on Crichton, since he's probably my favorite contemporary author. I've read all of his books, including the John Lange and Michael Douglas pseudonym novels, and I saw some uncharacteristic errors in ""Prey.""
First, ""Prey"" is written in first person, and I don't particularly enjoy his first person writing (Case of Need, Rising Sun, etc.). It's not just a style preference - it actually stems from Crichton's intrinsic writing style. As any of his readers know, what makes his writing so amazing is his ability to seamlessly integrate in-depth research into fiction. However, the first person perspective naturally limits a writer's freedom to do this, and in Crichton's writing this tends to lead to awkward inner-reflections and cumbersome bursts of dialogue. While ""Prey"" manages this far better than say, ""Rising Sun,"" it still limits what is arguably the best reason for reading Crichton to begin with.
Second, this is the one novel where I would surrender to his more ardent critics that the ""technology"" portion of the novel competed with the plot. In past novels the unbelievably deep science has been woven into the story with amazing clarity, and the technology serves the story itself (Jurassic Park, Timeline). In ""Prey,"" however, I found in more than any other novel that Crichton was using a contrived and cookie-cutter plot as a soapbox to enlighten us on scientific ethics, in this case artificial intelligence. The plot is simple and in my opinion jaded - scientist screw up, release something bad into nature, it needs to be contained...I've already read ""The Stand"" and ""Outbreak."" While Crichton normally takes the normal and elevates it to the sublime, in this case he didn't. The plot was nothing more than the obvious outcome of a given situation. The science was also much more complicated than in previous works and I would imagine the average reader will be lost throughout much of it, or at least struggling so hard to understand nanotechnology they'll miss the relevance to the story.
Third, the dialogue is off. Thinking back throughout his works, I realized that Crichton hasn't written many teenagers. This book shows us why. There are sections of the teenagers' dialogue that are literally embarrassing to read. Example: ""...I'm trying Dad. But he is a majorly turkey (...)."" ""I am not! Up yours, weasel poop!"" No it's not a typo - ""a majorly turkey (...)."" I don't know if Crichton (or his editor) has actually spoken to a teenager in the last 25 years, but in my experience no kids - nor any other human being I've ever known - actually talk like this. The teen dialogue is utterly unacceptable.
These are the major problems with the novel, and I feel it's at the bottom of Crichton's efforts. If you're a fan it's definitely worth reading, but for me it just didn't have that special thing that all his other novels have.",books

Douglas Coupland is popular with my generation, most likely because he makes keen observations about life from a perspective people of the X Generation can understand and relate to. Heck he must be the expert since he coined the term ""Generation X"". However, he also must appeal to the ME ME ME IT'S ALL ABOUT ME self-centredness that is a part of the nature of most people of this generation. Also it must appeal to their short attention spans and complete irreverence toward just about everything. I recognise that this is a generalisation, and I am not condemning Coupland nor his fans. I am simply saying that Coupland's writing style is idiosyncratic and definitely has one target audience. I read his earlier works, and I enjoyed them more or less, but there is a quality to Coupland's writing that seems very surface and artificial despite his astute and timely observations about people and things. Coupland is genuinely witty in his writing, but most of the time I find that he tries too hard. What I mean by this is that he overreaches for authenticity. For example, in Microserfs, he writes about how he went shopping at the Uwajimaya on 156th in Bellevue. Locals will be impressed that he knows his stuff and people from outside of the greater Bellevue/Redmond/Eastside area will be impressed with his knowledge, or maybe his imagination if they don't know that Uwajimaya is really on 156th in Bellevue. The problem for me, though, is that these little things just go too far by a tiny amount that just push these references right over the thin line of what is clever and what is trying too hard. Maybe just Uwajimaya in Bellevue OR Uwajimaya on 156th. Either/or but not both! Just too many offhand refences to places, landmarks (like the now-imploded Kingdome) and local ""things"" to prove he had actually done his homework or something. I know some people were very impressed by that level of detail, but I found it, once again, artificial.
Coupland writes Microserfs like a journal and brings up many interesting points, like how Gen X parents expected their company to take care of them forever and in exchange the employees gave unwavering loyalty. Gen Xers think of almost all jobs as temporary stepping stones to something else. Interestingly, most of what technical talk Coupland included is all pretty out of date considering that the software industry moves like lightning. Most of the interesting observations come in the beginning of the book when the main character is still working for Microsoft. Most of Coupland's references are so dead-on with regard to Microsoft culture and life, which is probably why most Microsofties read it and like it. However, when all the employees move to the Bay Area to work at a start-up, the book completely loses direction and all sense of coherence.
The narrator, Dan, discusses his co-workers and their quirks, discusses how he does not understand what exactly the ""Information Superhighway"" is supposed to be and goes off on a tangent about how major freeway construction died around 1975. He notes that only foreign employees at Microsoft seem to smoke, and it is not a surprise that user-friendliness is a West Coast American concept. Later in the book, the observations deteriorate to Dan reporting what his friends have said, such as the reasons why breakfast cereals are ""decadent"" or Karla and other characters discussing how their Barbie dolls had sex lives.
Yes the book explores the ever-searching nature of people born in this generation, yes the book examines the culture of Microsoft and can be painstakingly funny in doing so, and yes the book is readable. Is it great? Is it a classic? No. It can be read in a half day for fun, and that should be all you read it for.",books

244,44,7498,"Mr. Crichton has developed a habit of taking current technologic challenges and submitting them to flights of fancy. Such is the case with his latest novel. Here is the thesis: increasingly complex systems become increasingly uncontrolable, and at some point may develop behaviors beyond those intended or anticipated by the designers. In a sense these behaviors may mimic evolution, at some point the creatures imitating if not in fact becoming sentient creatures. Of course these creatures would not be worth a novel if they didn't do Really Bad Things, and couldn't be contained or controlled in a conventional way. The creatures in this case are microscopic machines manufactured (bred?) to act as collectively as a camera, that take on the characterists  of a predatory algorithm conveniently built into its programming by its designers. They attack things, multiply, threaten to take over the earth; well, you get the idea. The subplot concerns the marital relationship between an unemployed programmer who just happened to design the algorithm, and his wife, who just happens to be an executive in the company who inadvisedly included his algorithm into the microbots. Did she cheat on him or not? Does the world end? What unswered questions will we have at the last page? Sticky sweet melodrama to be sure, but worth an afternoon to read.
The thought came to me as I read another of Mr. Crichton's books (Airframe) that he had written it with the movie rights in mind. No deep character development, thank you, and evenly paced, if not contrived, action. The same happened as I read this book. Now that is not necessarily a bad thing. If you want a little more meat with your starch, maybe try Stephen King. A lot more energy could have been given to what the principals felt and though along the whole way. Narrated by a man who on the one hand is troubled by his wife's (possibly unfaithful) behavior, and on the other by the technology he spawned that threatens mankind, I would have liked a better image of what made him tick, and a little less stereotype. Being part geek by nature I didn't mind all the techno stuff, but it may be off-putting to some. These reservations aside, Prey is worth the time to read it, or as in this case, to hear while on the way to work. Keep your literary expecations in check, though, and try not to lose any sleep over the thought that there may be nanobots in your soup.",books

256,56,8964,"This book isn't going to change the world, but it delivers succinctly what many business books explore in greater depth albeit over hundreds of mind-numbingly boring pages. While I appreciate the attempt to sort of humanize business education by attempting to create a narrative, it's not *really* a narrative, so I think of this as a bit unnecessary and somewhat annoyingly half-behinded.

But the lessons in it are good for anyone thinking about management or business, whether you are in a Fortune 500 company, a startup, or a nonprofit: Don't unnecessarily complicate things, be direct, and correct mistakes as they happen.  Blanchard and Johnson basically allude to the well-established point that happy workers deliver better product and that productive workers shouldn't be wasting their time overcomplicating the work they are doing, whether that refers to process-oriented work (a.k.a. time wasting, they don't go into this at all) or even the very idea of being able to explain what it is that they do for the company.

This isn't any one special philosophy-- small bits of these lessons are found in things like agile (maximizing time spent on work product as opposed to other nonsense), Six Sigma (identifying and correcting mistakes), strategy and game theory (why people make certain decisions based on certain information), and various other frameworks for CI and management. But this is a MUCH faster read than textbooks that attempt to apply pseudoscientific logic over hundreds of pages to these same basic topics. I would say it's a good intro, but don't think too deep.",books

The book takes an interesting look at the problems of Roman city planning, namely creating a well-organized, easily defended settlement with proper infrastructure, without the city becoming overpopulated.  As you'd expect from Macaulay, the illustrations are superbly executed in his iconic crosshatched style, and his depictions of city life, and structures being built, are a joy to behold.  We follow the development of the city from a small military camp to a bustling city of 50,000, showing each step in the city's establishment. Macaulay depicts the building of aqueducts, defensive walls, a road system, sewers, government buildings, homes, markets, an amphitheater, and public baths.

Although it's beautifully illustrated and raises some relevant points about urban planning, ""City"" falls a little short when compared with some of Macaulay's other works. It's exceptionally well done for a ""kid's book,"" but the writing feels a little simplistic in places, and the artwork isn't quite as stunning as it was in ""Cathedral."" I recommend ""City"" mostly to the author's fans, or to people interested in ancient Rome, but aren't looking for a stuffy textbook. I'm not sure if kids will totally understand or really appreciate this book, although it does include a handy glossary. It does raise an interesting point - once a Roman city had reached it's maximum size, it's walls were just as much for keeping the city in, as they were for keeping the enemy out!",books

281,81,6273,"Considering the intended target audience for this novel, the pacing and storyline of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader could not be more spot on. The story focuses on the two youngest of the Pevensie children as they once again find themselves in Narnia, this time with their not-so-pleasant cousin. The action starts right away as the three are plunged directly into an ocean and rescued by Prince Caspian and crew. The story then commences as the crew journeys from island to island in a dual quest to find several lords who disappeared several years ago and to also find Aslan's land at the far eastern edge of the world. The book mainly moves from adventure to adventure as the group discovers several islands and searches them for their lost compatriots.

Lewis does a fine job of creating an action-packed adventure for young readers. In this one, he saves himself a lot of down time by incorporating mainly familiar characters from the previous novels as the main characters in this one.

My only real complaint in this one is that the religious aspect that had mainly taken a background role in the first two books is very much front and center at several times throughout this one and is especially strongly presented in the ending. I have nothing against religion and knew ahead of time that this was an underlying theme in this series, but the abrupt change in tone from the first two books to this one was a bit off-putting to me.

Also, as an aside, I get a little irritated with the lack of consensus in the order of these novels. Why folks can't number them in the intended order that they were published in is beyond me.",books

298,98,6633,"Having all of Narnia in one book was fantastic.  I felt that the reading had better pacing when it was set in this format.  I started a few months ago, and I finished without putting creases or bends in the book.  If I had the set of individual books, I'm sure they'd be a little knicked up by now, but the Chronicles of Narnia on this page held up like a trooper.

As far as the series goes, it's essential to the realm of fantasy.  I enjoyed some books more than others.  For example I loved Voyage of the Dawn Treader, Silver Chair, and Magician's Nephew.  The other books were ok, but I nearly dozed of through Horse and His Boy and Prince Caspian.  The good thing is that C.S. Lewis shows a great range throughout the series, so it has something to offer everyone.  The christian undertones were tolerable.  I didn't feel like it took away from the story.  In comparison, I'd say the religious influence in this novel was more readable than Phillip Pullman's evolution lecture throughout The Amber Spyglass.  If you feel quite strongly about what you praise and it is not Christianity, then you may want to pass Narnia.  It's very symbolic in it's presentation, and it has offended a significant amount of people.

So you want my opinion?  This book is the best way to read the series, because I tried to start off reading the single books and I never finished.  I vowed to finish the series in '09 and I finally finished up my childhood in this bargain buy.  Don't expect each book to be as groundbreaking as The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, but all the books have their special moments.

The last 150 pages were exciting and made it hard to put down, but the first 150 pages were boring and almost caused me to quit reading it.  I was expecting a story like Andromeda Strain, Jurassic Park, Congo, or Timeline that got you into the action fast as well as taught you about the science and technology Crichton is covering in the story.
He did cover how the emerging nanotechnology of molecular robots combined with biotechnology and computer technology could get out of control on its own.

306,106,6500,"First time I'd read the book almost to the end, I was thrilled. The stories were surprising and imaginative.

HOWEVER now I know that in the ending book of the Chronicle, author C. S. Lewis gives dubious teachings that totally contradict with the Bible. Being wiser in this regard, I couldn't recommend this book to any Christians, neither children nor adults.

The book, made by this so-called Christian preacher, claims in the last book (The final battle of Narnia) that Aslan (there are clear references to Jesus throughout the Chronicles) and ""Tars"" (some other ""god"") are the same.

Here's the translation of that claim (chapter 15, my translation from the Finnish version): ""My child, all that you've made to serve Tars, I take it as your service to me"". So it clearly states that believing in any other god is the same as believing in Jesus Christ and His Father. So Lewis totally opposes to the message of the Bible and the Gospels.

What's more, this claim is intentionally in the book: my friend has told me about ""the pastor"" Lewis's teachings that are in line with this uncomprehensible distortion of the Word.",books
307,107,4338,"I love the old children's stories that actually read as well now as back when I was little.

The edition I have is uncut and unabridged, so there are a few turns of phrase early in the book that stand out as racist, but since the character doing the talking in that moment was being described in really unflattering terms, and likely oblivious to the offensiveness of her word choices, I think leaving the scenes as-is lets them stand as moments of character revelation that might not be so effective if the language were watered down. She changes quite a lot across the book, so her sorry beginnings make the transformation somewhat poignant. Also, I'm not a fan of rewriting old books just to sanitize them. The author intended to create a certain effect with her word choices, so they should stand.

I like these little Collector's Library books. They fit nicely in my hands and can fit in a bag for easy travel reading.",books

310,110,6093,"Due to the overwhelming popularity of the beloved NARNIA series C.S. Lewis continues the adventures of the Penvensie children--with the addition of a few new human kids. After all, he was the creator of this fascinaitng land of fantasy and evil (and ultimately its destroyer). In this book (#5) readers meet the two younger siblings, Lucy and Edmund, plus recognize with distaste that whiny pest, their Cousin Eustace. Imagine: one minute the trio is contemplating a paining of a quaint old sailing ship--and the next they are suddenly sucked up into the actual picture, to find themselves on board. Talk about a literary launch!

Decades have passed in Narnia (way ahead of Real time on Earth) so their friend, Prince Caspian, is now a king--a fully grown man. His maritime mission: to locate many of his knights who were sent into exile by his usurper uncle. (Aha--the lust for the throne is the same here as on Earth--the foibles and failings of mankind penetrate even this special country.) Willing to sail to the edge of the world (which Narnians believed was flat) Caspian welcomes the arrival of three children who will support his noble cause. Will wimpy Eustace prove an embarrassment to the dedicated siblings, who are thrilled to find themselves back in a magical milieu--where they might encounter the great Aslan in leonine person?

The most interesting New character is a fearless, amusingly pompous mouse named Reepicheep--totally committed to Caspian's cause. Although each book in this wonderful series can stand alone, it is best for the sake of long-term literary continuity to read them in chronological order--discounting THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW--the actual prequel which obligingly explains how all the elements of the Narnia we have come to love came into being.",books

331,131,8487,"This most recent novel by Michael Crichton is another deep expression of concern about the misuse of science and technology by future-blind, irresponsible scientists and corporations bent only on the 'bottom-line'; and as a result, blind as to the dire consequences of their actions. As he writes in the introduction, '...our self-deluded recklessness will collide with our growing technological power.' In fact, this has been Crichton's pre-occupation for over twenty-five years, beginning with one of his first novels, 'The Terminal Man.' His most successfiul novel to date, 'Jurassic Park', expressed this concern in no uncertain terms - genetics gone terribly wrong - in this case, however, nature retaliates in the form of dangerous dinosaurs. In ~Prey~ the new villian takes the form of self-reproducing machines - nanoparticles or micro-robots - a highly creative merging of nanotechnology, biotechnology and computer science.
What I personally enjoy about all Crichton's novels, is that you never come away from the reading experience without learning something. The man does immaculate research for each project and it shows. This novel is no different.
Crichton fans will not be disappointed with this novel because it reads at a cracking pace, maintaining tension until the last page.
~Prey~ is a highly informative and entertaining read.",books
332,132,7781,"I disagree with the naysayers. I think this was one of Crichton's better efforts. It was certainly better than Next, a book I also recently read. One aspect that added power to the story is the fact that this nano-technology is actually advancing and may produce such nano machines within our lifetimes. It is genuinely scary to contemplate what could happen if these machines were to merge in some  manner and begin sharing predatory information. This is not completely unrealistic in view of the fact that the military would without doubt take a hard look at nano machines as methods of undercover attack during time of war. All that would be required would be for some of these machines to go a bit haywire and begin attacking humans indiscriminately. Compared to Crichton's Next, I thought this was more fearfully realistic. This is a keeper.",books

341,141,6863,"The fifth book in the series finds Lucy, Edmund, and Eustace joining Prince caspian on a ship called The Dawn Treader, which is setting sail to little known Narnian territories where Caspians uncles have been exiled. Each island explores a different sin by which an uncle fell, and a different magical encounter for the voyagers to face and resolve.

The developement of the mighty mouse Reepicheep is an especially welcome treat for children, and the scene in which Eustace becomes a dragon and embodies his own foul heart, so gaining a sort of enlightenment and a definite change of character, is a particularly skillful use of symbolism.

The reaching of Aslan's kingdom is also a symbol of enlightenment, with the Kingdom of Aslan invoking the Kingdom of Heaven in the reader's mind. The islands can be seen as steps in the path to heaven, and the character developement along the way can be seen as an outline to the steps towards righteousness and spirituality. As a fantasy or as a religious writing, this is a hugely important book!

343,143,4374,"Airborn is a delightful read in the spirit of the classic adventure tale.  If you'd like a mash up of Robert Louis Stevenson and Jules Verne, then you'll love Kenneth Oppel's Airborn trilogy.  Like pirates, airships, mysterious islands, strange creatures, and lots of derring-do?  You'll have a ball.  While written for a young adult audience, it's entertaining for adults as well.

344,144,9875,"Reward or punishment! Is this politically correct now-a-days. You bet not, but the idea is worth looking at and thinking about.
There are some interesting ideas contained in the very short read. It will provide the beginning manager with a good base to develop their own style, but shouldn't be copied outright. The words ""reward"" and ""punishment"" should be re-worked so as not to offend those PC fanatics who cannot deal with older thinking. Also, comparing the trreatment of personnel to that of training a dog, well, it doesn't play well anywhere.
I say give this book a read. Find some concepts that you can think about, and see if they can be applied to your present situation. If you spend more than 2 hours reading it, I'd be surprised. Use it as a brainstorming tool, not a How To book.",books

Now that I  have discovered Anne Hillerman novels I will be reading Leaphorn and Chee stories for the foreseeable future.",books
350,150,2934,"Warning, this review gives away the very end of the book, so if you have not read the book, don't read this review.
So, first what I liked was just about everything. This was a well written, easy to read book. My edition was 470 pages, and I had it read in 2 days. The story sucks you in pretty well. I even was able to tolerate the romantic parts, and there are lots of them when Robert Jordan falls in love with the young lady Maria. Usually I roll my eyes and skip past the slop, but this was not too bad. The ending at the bridge was extremely well done. When I read about Robert Jordan down there planting his explosives, near panic because he still hears shooting up above, trying to calm himself down, it really did make my own heart beat a little faster. No book has done that to me in a very long time.
So here's what I didn't like. First, it seems like two-thirds of the book was a buildup to the attack on the bridge. After a while, I was thinking, get on with it, already. The big one, however, that ruined the book for me, was the last few pages. Robert Jordan blew up the bridge, reunited with what was left of his group, reunited with Maria, and was fleeing, when a tank shell knocked him off his horse and the horse collapsed on top of him, breaking his leg. Now, in this part, Maria is absolutely right. She wants to cut the load off one of the horses and throw Robert Jordan on its back. Sure, his leg was broken.. so what? That's a non-fatal wound. He wasn't losing any blood as far as I could tell from the text. Sure, he probably would have lost his leg, but so what? Better than losing his life. I really hate what he does here. He gives up. He drives Maria away, breaking her heart for life. Then he lies there with a gun, waiting for the enemy so he can go out in a blaze of glory.
Maybe Hemingway meant for this to be noble and heroic. Not for me. To me, it was stupid, unnecessary, and downright cowardly. You see, I'm not suicidal, and I can't get past the fact that this joker did not have a fatal injury. He could have lived and escaped. He had done his bit for the cause in blowing up the bridge. He had a woman (Maria) who loved him and was willing to marry him. He had a good, secure job waiting for him back in the States. The only downside for him is that he may have lost one leg. Big deal. To me, in throwing all that away and committing suicide, Robert Jordan ended up a despicable coward. His little suicidal ending may have killed one enemy officer. A suicidal ending like his is appropriate if you are inches from death; better to take one of them with you on the way out. But Robert Jordan was NOT near death! He just had a busted leg. So he's an idiot, and did not deserve Maria's love. The only possible benefit I can see is that maybe, IF he managed to kill that enemy officer, it allowed the group with Maria a little more time to get away. But they were all behind enemy lines anyway, so I'm not sure how much that matters.
So, to sum it all up, I really enjoyed this book up to the last few pages. I was so let down by that ending that I took a star off, and I give it 4 out of 5.",books
351,151,8254,"In Prey, Michael Crichton does it again: merges action with techno-zeitgeist by bringing nanotechnology into his familiar world of brainy, regular-Joe heroes; a supporting cast of death-ready, 2-dimensional characters; and bad guys so obvious they might as well be twirling Snidely Whiplash moustaches as they violate the boundaries of nature.
It's my firm conviction that, by now, Crichton-- a very smart, very tall man, with lots of connections and money-- has created his very own, personalized Novel Writing Machine full of evolutionary algorithms and whatnot such that, when he gets an idea (and he almost always has A+ ideas) he can shoot an outline and a few key concepts into his NWM and set it to cook for, oh, a week.  In the meantime, he sells the movie rights and adjusts characters according to producers' casting concerns.
Which is my smart... way of saying this book, like many of his others, has a great ""hook"" to use a music industry term and one that continues to rook me in, despite the knowledge that I will be forced to read as one stock character after another (or, in Prey, the main character) describes in giant blocks of exposition how it is the science works.  And, you know, all these tiny robots are cool but I could read Engines of Creation by Eric Drexler and care more about the characters... and it's non-fiction.
I would recommend Prey only to those who know what they're getting into, and to speed-readers with a long airplane ride ahead of them.  Or to those with the constitution to become emotionally involved in soap opera plots and people.",books

353,153,2820,"American Robert Jordan is so dedicated to the ideals of liberty and equality for all that he has joined Communists fighting the fascists in the Spanish Civil War. As a dynamiter, he has been assigned to blow up a bridge at a certain time, three days away. In the mean time, he must win over the local guerrillas and procure their help.

In For Whom the Bell Tolls, Hemingway crafted a near-perfect novel. The characters goals are clear. Their motivations and stakes are high. Their problems and setbacks are many. Everybody is flawed and damaged, some considerably more than others. And their dangerous task looms relentlessly over every interaction as the plot progresses. From the start, the reader knows that 1) either they will or will not success in ""blowing"" the bridge and 2) its almost certain some of the characters will die in the process. By the end, I had come to love and root hard for Robert Jordan and his strange band as they went to their task.

Hemingway is a master at getting inside the heads of his characters. Through their thoughts, he examines love and war, honor and cowardice, respect, fear of loneliness, God and religions, and the atrocities human beings commit against others during war.

The characters speech often sounds very literally translated Spanish. Example: What passes with thee? For me, that and the sprinkling of actual Spanish contribute to the authentic feel of the story. The back-and-forth arguments Robert Jordan carries on in his mind are fantastically written as are the scenes about truly great love. Seventy-five years after For Whom the Bell Tolls was published, the story and themes are as profound and beautiful as ever.",books

355,155,9563,"Recently, while waiting for my man to check out at a department store, I was once again dragged into the saga of The Cat in the Hat.  And who wouldn't be attracted to this charmingly bright colored book?  Simply written, captivating and totally engaging.  Read this as an adult with new eyes.  It's an allegory.  The total abandon the cat brings to these children's rainy afternoon is really a lesson for all readers.  Don't play it safe.  Learn every day and try new things.  Don't box yourself in.  Why not BE The Cat in the Hat ourselves?  For anyone with a creative bent, this book offers the gateway.

Obviously, geared toward children, the language is straightforward and basic enough even for beginner readers.  And its structure has all the musicality of a poem.  However, none of Seuss' work ever reads dumb downed.  The beauty in fact resides in its simplicity.  So, if you have children, please read this to them.

Mr. Hillerman mentions ""the Department of the Interior's efforts to explain what has happened to $176,000,000 (billions!!!) of Indian oil, gas, coal, timber, etc-royalties which it can't seem to account for.""
In reading this book, it seemed as if Mr. Hillerman's outrage over this little publicized situation and his effort to call attention to it, led him to give less attention to his usual complexity of character and setting.
This book was perfect for airplane reading and may lead me to learn more about the missing royalities. It may also lead me to read ""Seldom Disappointed"" to learn more about Tony Hillerman and what makes him tick.",books

376,176,6577,"The Last Battle is an amazing ending to a wonderful series. Yes, it was sad at times, but I thought it was the perfect way to finish it up. It starts off with an ape named Shift along with his donkey ""friend"" named Puzzle finding a lion skin. Shift then starts formulating a plan that involves Puzzle wearing the lion skin and pretending to be Aslan. I really did not like Shift, but that was the point. He was a horrible ape who was extremely annoying and arrogant. He ends up helping the Calormenes take over Narnia, which is horrible!

King Tirian is captured, so he ends up getting help from Eustace and Jill. I like Eustace and Jill in this book the most probably because they are a bit older and more mature. There are many deaths in this book from the battle. Unfortunately or fortunately (depends how you look at it) Narnia comes to its end, but the good news is the characters get to go to Aslan's Country AKA Heaven.

What I loved about this book was that all of my favorite characters from the previous books make an appearance. I did not realize how much I missed them until they reappeared. There are a few new characters that I ended up loving. One of them being Jewel the unicorn. Jewel is such a devoted friend to King Tirian and a great addition to the world of Narnia. The saddest part of this book for me was finding out that Susan does not believe in Narnia any more. Still, this is probably one of favorites of the Chronicles of Narnia.

Like I said, The Last Battle is the perfect book to end the Chronicles of Narnia. If you have not read this series, you must! It does have a few sad parts, but I liked the way it ended. I am so glad I took the time to read this series. It was definitely worth it because it is so beautiful! Narnia is a world that everyone should explore at least once. It is such a beautiful place, and I kind of wish I could live there.",books

378,178,1575,"I purchased this book (as well as all of the other Dr. Seuss books) as soon as they became available for the Kindle.  It helped that there was a great promotional price at the time but the real motivator was to have them for my, at that time, infant grandson to read.

Fast forward a couple of years and I realized that while the Kindle version is great to have (especially when on-the-go), nothing really replaces having the actual book in hand for a toddler.  My grandson is now almost three years old and can handle the delicate process of turning thin, paper pages.  He loves to sit and read books to himself or to his baby sister.  Because of this new realization, I have decided to pick up the books in this series in hardback format.

Green Eggs and Ham is one of the wonderful books I remember from my own childhood and I love the book's rhymes and illustrations.  It was one of the Dr. Seuss books that I purchased and read to my children when they were young.  We still have those old books but I gave them to my daughters when they moved away from home so they could keep an important piece of their childhood with them.  I now get to have the opportunity to buy them again and enjoy reading them to a new generation.",books
379,179,6860,"The Magician's Nephew
This is the book in the Narnia series that I enjoyed the most, but I believe this is partly because I read ""Wardrobe"" first. The revelation of the origin of the queen, the making of a rift to Narnia, and the learning of the children's heritage were particularly fascinating because of the questions that ""Wardrobe"" had so successfully set up. Also, the creation of Narnia, the history of the wardrobe, and the placing of the lamppost were most entertaining. I especially liked learning about the particular evil of Queen Jadis. Reading this reveals much insight to TSRs inspiration for the Drow.
Queen Jadis is one of the most intriguing characters in Chronicles, and I missed her presence in the majority of the books.
The book's religious symbolism is artful and intricate, and the book is divurgent from the others in the Narnia series in that it spends much of its time in our world, and that creatures from the other side actually appear in our world as opposed to exclusively vice versa.
Plus, we even get to journey to the place between worlds and to the dead universe from where Jadis is freed. A deeper understanding of Lewis's fantastic universe is revealed, but infinite possibilities are left to the imagination!

The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe

I read this book as a teenager, learning of Lewis from my passion for Tolkien. The book totally fascinated me then, and made me hungry for more. I remember reading a few more of the books in the series, and though I enjoyed them, I never did find the original magic in them that this one inspired. I lost one of the books or two and never completed the series, but years later I returned to it in order to read them to my step-son, and now I'm very glad to have read the whole series in it's entirity.
First off, this and the first book are absolutely the best ones. This time we started with the first book, which I think is named ""The Magician's Nephew,"" and I daresay that as an adult I enjoyed it even MORE than ""Wardrobe."" The origins of the breach into Narnia and the original sin that freed the witch were fascinating to me.
But returning to ""Wardrobe"" was a true delight. Now that I can better digest the symbolism and glean more from the story with the added info learned from ""Nephew,"" the book claimed a new tantalizing power over me. My step-son enjoyed it immensely, and couldn't wait to have another chapter read to him each night for bedtime.
As an adult I am now able to better appreciate Lewis's incredible talent for character developement and symbolism, as well as his strong imagination and elegant writing style. The rest of the books were also great, and I'm happy to have finally gotten around to reading them all. Certainly the least in the ""Narnia"" series is far and above the vast majority of children's chapter books. But for me, the first two are by far the best, approaching the status of even 'The Hobbit,"" and from me that is saying worlds.

A Horse and His Boy
This third book in the Chronicles of Narnia stands out from the others in that it is the only one that doesn't star children of our world being magically transported to Narnia. The protagonist is a boy named Shasta who lives in Colormen across a vast desert from Narnia. Shasta finds that he is soon to be sold to a Calormene noble, and decides to run away and teams up with an enslaved talking Narnian warhorse named Bree. The siblings high kings and queens from ""Narnia"" do make a guest appearance, now adults and fully integrated into the Narnian world. But this book is mostly concerned with the escalating tensions between Calormene and Narnia and the adventures of a horse and his boy, as the title replies. Lewis creates an enchanting story with the classic ingredients of an epic quest, with plenty of intriguing symbolism along the way, and plenty of help from the ever-watchful best-loved lion Aslan.

Prince Caspian

Peter, Lucy, Susan, and Edmund are once again whisked into the land of Narnia when they least expect it: while in a subway together several years after ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."" Narnia has been conquered by a plotting king, and the ""old Narnians"" are now scattered in hiding from the wicked humans. The children must aid Prince Caspian, the exiled rightful owner of Narnia, and win their kingdom back for the good of all.
This is an epic tale with many new and fascinating creatures introduced, with a central theme of faith. The fact that Lucy is the only one able to see the glimpses of Aslan when the struggle becomes bitter speaks volumes about the virtue of faith, and we can already see in this installment how Susan began to lose hers. The children are not only called to Narnia to save it once again, but to teach the new Prince the value of the old and magical ways of Narnia, and to learn a spiritual lesson themselves.
Voyage of the Dawn Treader
The fifth book in the series finds Lucy, Edmund, and Eustace joining Prince caspian on a ship called The Dawn Treader, which is setting sail to little known Narnian territories where Caspians uncles have been exiled. Each island explores a different sin by which an uncle fell, and a different magical encounter for the voyagers to face and resolve.
The developement of the mighty mouse Reepicheep is an especially welcome treat for children, and the scene in which Eustace becomes a dragon and embodies his own foul heart, so gaining a sort of enlightenment and a definite change of character, is a particularly skillful use of symbolism.
The reaching of Aslan's kingdom is also a symbol of enlightenment, with the Kingdom of Aslan invoking the Kingdom of Heaven in the reader's mind. The islands can be seen as steps in the path to heaven, and the character developement along the way can be seen as an outline to the steps towards righteousness and spirituality. As a fantasy or as a religious writing, this is a hugely important book!
The Silver Chair
By the time this book takes place, Eustace has almost shirked his old snotty self and become, like Edmund, a valiant young man. Introduced is Jill, the newest Daughter of Eve to be catapulted into Narnia, landing in Aslan's world with her own baggage and set of peculiar hang-ups and problems. Let the transformations begin!
This is probably the darkest and gloomiest of the Narnian Chronicles, most of it taking place in an subteranean world of gnomes and lightless creatures. Lewis' gnomes are not cute dwarven creatures, but something like gloomy human moles without emotion. They must be ""shown the light"" by the Sons of Adam and the Daughters of Eve. The visit to the land of the giants is also a somewhat scary span of chapters, with betrayal and helplessness being central themes. But of course good old Aslan has a path for the children to follow and a valuable lesson for them to learn, though the two adventurers find it almost impossible to carry it out as they were instructed too. A trmendously well thought out fantasy story which imparts much understanding about religion and about how God works his magic in our world. Faith and redemption are also central themes as the children are tested by the decision to trust the cursed knight, and the knight is freed from a witch's treacherous spell.

The Last Battle

The Last battle is a fitting end of one the greatest fantasy series of all time. Lewis does not let readers down with his last installments, and tells a great and freshly imaginative story while tieing up all loose ends in the Chronicles. Unlike the the other stories, this one starts out in Narnia with a spotlight on the bad-guy: an ape finds a lion pelt and uses a dumb but unsuspecting donkey to inact a huge farce to put himself in power.
The callous and stupid apes treachery and callousness is sure to enrage lovers of Narnia, and unlike the other books we get a real sense that even in Narnia there can be true pain and suffering. Lucy and Eustace go through a sort of Baptism of fire in order to deliver the magical world from despair, and good King Tirian is shown to be one of the most likeable, well developed, and valiant rulers in the series.
The barn at the end of the book is an especially powerful symbol of the seering light of the presence of God, and the death and rebirth of Narnia is a bittersweet but powerful analogy of the Book of Revelation.

The Other Side of Yore",books
380,180,6143,"""The Magician's Nephew"" by C.S. Lewis is one of those books I read just because. Because I'd read ""The Lion, the Witch, and The Wardrobe"" when I was a kid. Because I always wondered what exactly Narnia was. Because I'd watched all the Narnia movies with my kids. Because it was sitting on my son's shelf collecting dust and it had a number one written on it: i.e. first book of the series. So because of all those reasons, I wiped the dust off of it and read it.

This book isn't about anyone I was familiar with from the other Narnia books/movies. Well, I guess Aslan is there toward the end, but honestly, the majority of the book is about Digory Kirke and Polly Plummer and that was okay, because their story was easy to grasp. You see, these two neighbors met, become friends then decide to explore the attic connecting their houses. Unfortunately, during their exploration, they accidently go into the study of Digory's Uncle Andrew, who is a magician. Hence the name of our book: The Magician's Nephew.

Once in Andrew's study, Polly is tricked by Digory's almost evil uncle into touching a magic yellow ring which causes her to vanish. It seems Uncle Andrew has been dabbling in ancient magic that allows one to travel between worlds. In order to save Polly, Digory is blackmailed by his uncle into testing another magic ring so as to follow Polly; our young hero also takes two green ones just in case they can actually try to return home. When Digory touches his yellow ring it transports him to a wood between the worlds where he finds Polly alive and well. Also there is a series of pools which the two discover lead to separate universes.

Of course, our two, young adventures decide not to immediately return home to England but to explore a different world and so jump into one of the nearby pools. Instantaneously, Digory and Polly find themselves in a desolate, abandoned city of some strange, ancient world, which they later learn is Charn. Inside an ancient building, which they surmise must have been a palace, they discover a huge room filled with statuesque figures of Charn's former kings and queens. These perfect statues are beautiful beyond compare but seem to degenerate from the fair and wise of the first to the unhappy and cruel of the later. Among these images from some long forgotten past, there is a bell and a hammer with these words written:

 Make your choice, adventurous Stranger
  Strike the bell and bide the danger
  Or wonder, till it drives you mad
  What would have followed if you had.

The story of Narnia start with that bell. Everything else spirals out from the fateful choice placed before Digory and Polly on whether to ring that bell. Sure, the rest of the book reveals to us the creation of Narnia and its talking animals,, the origins of the lamp-post, the wonders of its first human king and queen, the first evil deed of the White Witch, and of course Aslan's role in all of it. We are even told how the wardrobe becomes ""the wardrobe"" which ever after will transport some lucky few to Narnia. But it begins at the decision before the bell.

All in all, this was a very entertaining story. If I was still a kid I would have undoubtable rated it much higher, but it was still well-worth my time, especially since it answered all the ""how"" questions about Narnia. For that reason alone, you should give it a try.",books

391,191,3809,"We adopted ""Renoir, My Father"" as bedside reading while my wife was recovering from hip surgery, and (aside, perhaps, from ""Goodnight, Moon,"") I can't imagine better therapy.  This is odd, in a way: Claude was an old man (and in pain) when Jean got to know him, and Jean was an old man when he finally brought his recollectios together. You might expect cranky, but nothing of the sort: it's a book full of sunny afterglow.  Every parent would hope to be rememnbered so well.
The book might take a bit of getting used to: Jean has his own pace and his own way of telling his story.  We did it in small doses and I'm not certain yet that I quite catch the rhythm.  None of the rough edges have been smoothed off which, come to think of it, is just as Claude would have wanted: Jean speaks with his own voice.  You have to listen well, but you know that the voice is nobody else's.
I suppose it helps to know a bit about the Impressionists to enjoy it all, but I can't say I know all that much, and I didn't feel impaired.  Anyway, God bless Google: more than once, when Jean talked about a painting or a subject, I key-clicked my way to an image and completed (as it were) the picture.
Kudos also to NYRB (this time) for producing what it does not always produce: a finished physical specimen  The paper feels like quality; the binding is sturdy, and there is a small but satisfying selection of pictures, both colored and black-and-white.  There is even an index of sorts (I assume from the original translator) but it is patchy and incomplete.  That last is a shortcoming, but forgivable in light of the book's other virtues.

402,2,5666,"Few will disagree with me when I say that Scorsese's Taxi Driver is one of the greatest films ever made. This one helped define the 70s and changed the face of American cinema. Scorsese's directing is brilliant. DeNiro has never been better, nor has Cybill Shepard (except in The Last Picture Show). This is one of Harvey Keitel's finest performances, and Jodi Foster has her best role here. The acting is superb. The cinematography was groundbreaking with the camera moves Scorsese made. Superb editing. And while Bernard Herrmann's score is dated (definitely from the 70s), it is a classic and fits this film in a way no other music ever could. Add that to the fact that Herrmann died just after finishing recording for this film. What a way to end your career. This film is superb in every way.
The dvd is a treasure as well. You get a making of documentary that lasts just over an hour, taking the place of a commentary track (and this is one of the few documentaries that can replace a commentary track). There are storyboards, the screenplay, filmographs, advertising materials, and a photo montage that is narrated and covers trivia that isn't discussed in the documentary. This is a fine edition.
This is the movie that brought Robert DeNiro, Martin Scorsese, Jodi Foster, and Paul Schrader to forefront of the American eye.",movies

The score to this movie is also AMAZING!! Im a huge Marilyn Manson fan and the soundtrack to the movie is just incredible! He really outdid himself, even my friends who do not like Marilyn Manson music liked the score to this movie.

408,8,6904,"I will make this brief.

First, things I liked:

-This one is closer to the games than the first one, there are scenes that are taken straight from the games with some minor modifications.

-The animation blends better with the video here than in the first movie.

-Very decent cutting. After watching the deleted scenes, I noticed they were enjoyable but would have made the movie feel more campy.

-Loved the camera angles.

-The soundtrack's commercial songs seem a bit more polished than the first one's.

-Leads. I don't know who looks better but both Sienna and Milla light up the screen with their beauty. Took some realism away form the movie, but in all honesty I can't complain.

-Deleted scenes. I can understand why they cut them, and thankfully they are on the DVD. Jill's character really becomes my favorite after watching those deleted scenes.

-Outtakes. Not at Jackie Chan level, but amusing still.

Things I didn't like:

-The games' zombie rules seem to have been altered in this movie. It made sense in the first one because the corpses were fresh, here it doesn't make sense in some cases.

-The musical score is not as hauntingly addictive as the first movie's.

-To people who haven't played the games, Jill might seem as a character lacking more background info.

-There are some plot holes, but that happens in the games as well so I am used to it. You might not be.

Recommended if you like the RE games 1-3. Recommended if you need an action fix with bullets, explosions, beautiful women, horror, and an unusual plot.",movies

This is such a good movie. Like other screenplays Steve Martin has written, it's based on a classic piece of literature. The scene (about 30 minutes in) where Martin's character comes up with 20 different jokes about his nose actually has more than 20 (count 'em), which is something we no-lifes notice while watching.
Daryl Hannah -- sweet, gorgeous, tall, talented, unemployed? That's a shame. Her performance in this movie is the best of any of hers that I've seen. A few years later she had a cameo in ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" -- a truly great movie -- in which, alas, she had to play a stereotypical dumb blonde actress.
There are so many laughs, and so much sensitivity, that I'm not surprised at all that ""Roxanne"" is my sister's favorite Steve Martin movie. I love ""L.A. Story"", but have to give a slight edge to ""Roxanne"".",movies

Roy Neary (Dreyfuss) sees unusual lights in the sky as he drives home one night, his truck is engulfed by light, the radio goes beserk and the clock on his car is affected. He is bafflied and awestruck by this event. He sees a huge object overhead in the sky ... It has bright blinking lights on its underside. The size is monumental as it floats off. This event changes his life forever ... He begins to draw and paint a flat-topped mountain which becomes an obsession. He does not know what it means but the desire to understand becomes all consuming. People who witnessed this event are interviewed on TV. The local authorities try to maintain calm and order ...  The national government gets involved ... It becomes clear - we are not alone in the universe. Something is about to happen ...

The mysterious events are not only confined to Midwestern America ... A scientist interviews a poor Mexican farmer who saw the bright lights over the Mexican desert which he describes as the sun singing to him ... Roy Neary and many of his neighbors go out into the fields where the sky is the darkest and wait to see the phenomenon again. He meets Jillian Guiler and her son Barry who is fascinated by the lights and object ... The child runs off and is taken up into the UFO. Many other people have disappeared after encountering the object ... Roy's wife is fed up with his obsession. She leaves with the children to stay with her family. Roy discovers the meaning behind the flat-topped mountain ... He and Jillian partner together to visit Devil's Tower in Wyoming.

Government agents are everywhere claiming an environmental hazardous waste was spilled making the location unsafe for inhabitants ... everyone was evacuated. Roy and Jillian believe this is a  hoax and evade detection as they pursue their quest to discover the secrets behind the evacuation ... They climb over a mountain and see a huge landing field. They hear musical tones played which were familiar, as the sounds were heard when the UFO was overhead ... They know the moment for the ""First Encounter"" is about to arrive. The film has a fantastic climax and conclusion which unravels certain mysteries from the past and is completely satisfying to the viewer. The ending is exciting ... yet many questions remain unanswered.  Steven Spielberg created an all time favorite masterpiece which still keeps the mystery alive ...

I was shocked to learn the film  was done in 1928!

Columbia Tristar has given us a truly awful looking print of this film.  Colors are muddy and undistinguished.  Everything takes on an orange characteristic that is unbecoming to the story.  Night scenes suffer from low contrast levels.  Aliasing, shimmering and edge enhancement are all present throughout the print.  Fine grain elements and regular wear and tear have not been cleaned up for this presentation either.  Flesh tones are inaccurately rendered, either too orange or too pink.  There's a considerable loss of fine detail throughout, presumably because of noise reduction equipment used in mastering the print.  The soundtrack is dated, strident, unnatural sounding and very tinny.  It's 2.0 but almost sounding mono in spots while presenting the music at very boisterous listening levels that intrude on an otherwise very subdued audio presentation.  No extras - big surprise.  Columbia's penny pinching started with this release.  You can see where it's lead to by examining my reviews of ""The Awful Truth"" or ""Talk of the Town"".

444,44,7150,"Loved how actor Paul Brooke went from his priestly duties (The Messenger - 1999) of hearing the 2 or 3 times a day confession of young Joan of Arc, to auctioning off the Phantom of the Opera's (2004 film) glass chandelier in Paris, France in 1919.  Paul Brooke is the KING of opening scenes.  He was the star of the opening scenes in both films.  Very distinctive voice.
I liked how Joan of Arc went from hearing the voices of Saints: Margaret, Catherine, and Michael
to Christine's hearing the voice of the Angel of Music (The Phantom).

I like how THE MESSENGER unspokenly links the Burgundian wolves to the Benjamite wolves of Book of Judges chapters 19-21.
Both the Burgundians and Benjamites were known for rape murder (or) gang rape murder.  In the attack on Domremy(Doe Ray Me), a pack of black wolves leads the charge, as young Joan investigates her burning village. Joan's sister is then rape murdered (or murdered, then raped).

This film has (in my opinion) the best burning at the stake scene of all the Joan of Arc films.
And it quite clever how the film depicts Joan as receiving confession (night by a priest or bishop), but by her own conscience, played by actor
Dustin Hoffman.

This film does not give much attention to Isabelle Romee or Jacques d'Arc (Joan's parents).  If you want to see extensive footage on that you must watch the 1999 TV miniseries Joan of Arc.  Powers Boothe plays a very DARK (d'Arc) Jacques d'Arc - a d'Arc Vader sort of role.  But be sure to get that in DVD and not VHS because the VHS leaves out extremely important scenes such as Jacques d'Arc (Joan's dark father) attempting to snuff out the life of the newborn baby Joan.  You also would miss on VHS the ending scene where Jean d'Metz takes Joan's banner back to Doe-Ray-Me after her death - where you see her parents reaction to the news.

This film is properly rated R because of the rape/humping/murder scene of Joan's sister Catherine, for strong language: ""F"" word used extensively, and for other graphic battle scene violence.

There is more comic relief in this film about Joan than others I have seen (Joan of Arc - TV miniseries 1999; Joan of Arc - Child of War, Soldier of God - 2005; classic Joan of Arc (????) starring Ingrid Bergman).

If you watch the VHS version of The Messenger, you miss out on a couple things.  You miss out on the nuns inspecting Joan for proof of virginity.
You also miss out on Charles VII considering each of his 3 military captains for one to sit on the throne as himself to fool Joan.

Because we can identify more with a middle-aged electrician than we can with a moisture farmer on a desert planet. Richard Dreyfuss is the aforementioned electrician, who has an extraterrestrial experience and suddenly is obsessed with these aliens. This epic is an excellent early work of Stephen and truly delights the senses as well as the mind, and is still extremely watchable today. Now, for the faults. It starts slow and never really builds to a frantic pace, but it only increases the suspense. Although the aliens are a little disappointing (just the basic pointy-eyed, almond faced stereotypes), these faults are easily compensated in this amazing experience. One of the best sci-fi movies of all time.

457,57,1072,"Quite a strange movie actually, at once appearing simple but also complex, and the nihilist ending will not please many.

Strictly a ""two-hander"", (Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune), the latter speaking only Japanese throughout...no subtitles. You have to rely on Marvin's dialogue, and Mifune's expression. Now this is not as hard as it may sound.

It's also burdened with what has to be the weirdest selection of music as the soundtrack, varying from full church organ, loud discordant atonal concrete music and what surely has to be the sounds of air being allowed to escape from the stretched neck of a rubber balloon at one stage!

A basic story on the surface, just the two men from opposing armies, enemies marooned on an otherwise deserted Pacific island, struggling not only to survive, but hold each other at bay.
At first the motivations seem to be to kill, but gradually that changes to a power play for dominance over and degradation of the other.
The upper hand changes, but gradually realisation sets in that they will have to work together to survive, or even just get along.
The astute may note that as the two are gradually stripped of the trappings of civilisation, they in fact eventually become more ""civilized"", ....and when later some of the outward comforts of the civilised world are available to them,such as clean clothes, shaving and alcohol/cigarettes/magazines, they then fall back into barbarism.
Performances are good, ....although Marvin is perhaps a little too old for the character he's playing. The settings are genuine and their misery well-portrayed as they fight off thirst, starvation and the elements, ...even the sheer boredom.
There is a somewhat odd scene where Marvin tries to teach Mifune to retrieve a stick as a dog would....Mifune is tied most uncomfortably to some sort of a large branch at the time as well as  being hobbled.
Just who is teaching whom is open to interpretation as Mifune refuses and remains mute and impassive.....while Marvin continually demonstrates the demeaning task.
Realising that no one is coming to rescue them, eventually the two begin to tolerate each other, then go further to co-operate enough to build a raft substantial enough to get over the surrounding reef.
This being achieved, they sail off on the open ocean in search of rescue.
A plane is heard, but when Marvin tries to use an old whistle to attract attention, Mifune grabs it and throws it into the water. Just why he does this is unclear.
Eventually the raft drifts to some islands and upon coming ashore the two discover what seems to be a large abandoned military fortified gun emplacement. There are tense moments trying to discover whether it is Japanese or American, and tellingly, Marvin becomes concerned that the eagerly exploring Mifune may be shot by some American forces due to his being Japanese.
Marvin repeatedly cries out ""Don't shoot...don't shoot....he's my FRIEND!""
Mifune appears suddenly from the debris, frightening Marvin who exclaims ""Oh I thought you were a Japanese!""
The point being that although he IS Japanese, Marvin has begun to think of him as something more than just a racial type with whom his country is at war.

It becomes clear that the base is now abandoned after what must have been some heavy fighting, but the two find clothes and saki to salvage, and also clean themselves up, then begin to enjoy some camaraderie over a few drinks.

Another weird scene ensues with Marvin drunkenly asking Mifune why the Japanese don't believe in God.
Marvin himself, (the actor) appears very ill-at-ease performing this bit and it's not entirely successful.
Nor is the reason for this uncomfortable scene at all clear.
Then the pair suddenly become estranged again as Mifune sees some very graphic pictures of slain Japanese in an old Life magazine and wartime hatreds emerge once more.
Then, ...just as you think we will see if their hard-won friendship from the island and the raft journey will last or they will once again become sworn enemies......BANG! That nihilistic ending I previously mentioned happens and that's it.

Many will feel they have sat through a long movie where not a lot of action has happened, only to be denied a proper denouement.
I must admit it looked to me like they didn't quite know how to end it, and so went with the Apocalypse.
You may of course feel differently, but the movie as it stands remains largely a psychological study of two men, rather than any war-action piece.

WARNING: Do NOT watch if the title has you hoping to see some Audie Murphy/John Wayne heroics, with intense battle scenes.
You will be MAJORLY disappointed!

I enjoyed it for the power struggle and the humanity emerging over the nationalism, along with the performances, but must admit to finding the ending far too sudden and a most unsatisfactory way to dispose of two characters you have come to know over such a long movie.
Does it all count for nothing?
I wanted to see what they would do back in a world at war. Would they remain friends, or return to the roles that the war demanded they perform?
I believe some copies include an alternate ending. Mine does not but it is available on You-Tube, and is only about a minute long.
It too is enigmatic, not really telling you all that much about what happened next.

Four stars overall for me. (One off definitely for the ending.)

459,59,5713,"Martin Scorsese's 1976 masterpiece written by Paul Schrader to me is the ultimate film about loneliness and insanity. Two things that Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) obviously is. The movies starts out with Travis going to a cab company for a job. The reason is he can't sleep at nights. At his job he meets a lot of odd people in his cab. But, he also meets his share when off work too. Like fellow cabbie Wizard (Peter Boyle) whom at one point Travis tries confiding in. He really is loney and has no one to be with. All he does is drive his cab, untill, one day he meets Betsy (Cybill Shepherd). She's working on political campaign for some politician. At first she thinks he's ""creepy"". Tom (Albert Brooks) has I would say a crush on her. At first he tries to ""defend"" her against him. After the two go out for a brief time. She becomes digusted with him after he tries to take her to go see an adult movie. At this point the insanity kicks in. He now starts to talk about how the streets of New York make him sick. Everyone is ""scum"". He can't breathe the air. In an effort to ""free"" himself, he decides to ""save"" a very young prositute Iris (Jodie Foster). The problem first of all is, she doesn't think she needs to be saved. She thinks things are going ok. Secondly, her pimp Sport (Harvey Keitel) says he loves her. ""Taxi Driver"" hits so many right spots to keep our interest. It has so many powerful moments. The acting by De Niro is truly a standout. His Oscar nomination was rightfully deserved. We see this transformation in his character, and to me, it's spellbounding. His ""our you looking at me"" speech has to be one of the most OVER quoted lines in film history, it's right up there with ""What am I a clown? Am I here to amuse you?"". Scorsese is a director of considerable outstanding talents and this film allows him to showcase it very well. He also has a small cameo as a jealous husband who is spying on his wife, who is cheating on him. The movie was up for 4 Academy Awards; ""Best Picture"", ""Best Actor"", ""Best Supporting Actress"" (Jodie Foster), and ""Best Musical Score"".",movies

461,61,6144,"SLC Punk is a great movie, but not exactly what I was expecting. I expected a movie about punk kids stuck in the Mormon citadel of Salt Lake City. And while that is the basis of the movie, that's not really what it's  about.
What it's about is a punk guy named Steve-O and his friends that  spend all their time partying, doing drugs, and beating up rednecks, etc.  Eventually Steve-O starts to question the punk values he thinks are  important to him. In the movie, there is a lot of talk about posers, but in  the end Steve is a poser too.
I thought there would be more involving  conflicts with the Mormon religion, but there are suprisingly few. Even so,  SLC Punk is a great movie: all the performances are great, and the  direction and visual style is great to look at. The colors are bright and  vibrant, like the youthful energy that the movie exudes. The movie is  hilarious - Steve-O's rants and speeches about anarchy and violence are  great and the various scenes and flashbacks are very good.
One thing SLC  Punk lacks is a plot. It's really just a bunch of stuff that happens. It's  quite good though. See it.",movies

469,69,5717,"I've seen this film at least five times prior to seeing it again last night.  It is as fresh and as perfect as the day it was made and I enjoyed every moment again.  It seems every actor in it became either a major film or tv star in the years after it was made 25 years ago. Robert DeNiro is at his finest as Travis Bickel, a New York taxi driver, who slips further and further into a breakdown state. He can't sleep so drives his cab all night long. He runs into an amazing cast of characters on the city's streets including Jodie Foster, a teenage prostitute who has Harvey Keitel as her pimp; Cybill Shepard as the idealized woman he wants to court (his idea of a date is taking her to a porno movie!); Albert Brooks as a political worker; Peter Boyle as a fellow cabbie; director Martin Scorsese in a cameo role as an obsessed husband watching his wife carry on an affair from the back of Travis's cab.  The soundtrack I've had for years too as it is the most gorgeous saxophone accompaniment.  Perhaps the most perfect aspect that struck me this time though was the writing.  Paul Schaefer's screenplay was dead on.  He grabbed ahold of Travis Bickel's paranoid, alienated world and delivered it dead-on to us.  If only other film-makers understood the need to start with an absolutely first rate script, perhaps more films would be winners like this one too.

470,70,6001,"After I finished reading the truly horrible script for the 2011 remake of Fright Night I found myself with a new appreciation of the original movie.

  Peter Vincent is probably the most enjoyable character in this film.  Roddy McDowall stole the show as the slightly cowardly TV horror host who grows a spine and rises to be the heroic vampire killer he had always pretended to be.  The soundtrack is incredible.  The acting is brilliant.

  I have always loved Gothic Horror, particularly the old Hammer horror films such as what Peter Vincent shows on his TV show.  Not only do I not see a purpose in the Fright Night remake but I feel it fails on my many levels where the original excels.  The vampires of the original Fright night had the powers of Dracula, himself. They could turn into horrible little bats, or wolves, or mist.  They could enthrall human wills and could show up on film as a human might.  In the remake they have no such abilities and this is not so-well compensated by an excess of explosions.
  The writer of the remake claims that horror movie hosts don't exist anymore.  Not only is this not true but there are more horror movie hosts on TV AND Internet today than there ever were on TV in 1985.  Elvira's Movie Macabre, Mystery science theater 3000, Nostalgia Critic, just to name a few...  I think they made a huge mistake in changing Peter Vincent to a nearly unrecognizable stage magician in the remake.  If anything the movie host is more relatable now than ever before.

  Skip the remake, stick with the original. It makes more sense. It has more accessible characters.  Peter Vincent actually has depth rather than the show pretense of depth with the added backstory given in the remake.  Charlie is a lot nicer and a lot more sympathetic in the  original. And this one had memorable and catchy songs on the soundtrack. The vampires are more frightening while at the same time more charming and strangely sympathetic while also terrifying and deadly.  The humor isn't forced and there's no obnoxious product placement.  The remake...  has none of these qualities.  This is by far the superior film.  Skip the remake, kids.  Stick with the original!",movies
471,71,6673,"I've seen ""Midnight Express"" several times since it opened its first theatrical run.  When I saw it in the theater I was so caught up in the story that I didn't pay too much attention to its bargain-basement racism.  Today, it's so heavy handed and obvious I'm amazed I could have missed it.
This story of a young American caught smuggling Hashish out of Istanbul goes out of its way to depict Turkey as a brutal, corrupt country, full of ""furriners.""  Oliver Stone's script is embarrassing in places, particularly when Billy Hayes gives his big speech in court, calling Turkey ""a nation of pigs.""  Talk about begging the question!  I would be surprised if anyone of Turkish descent were not deeply offended by this.
As long as you don't take it too seriously, Midnight Express can be an enjoyable non-think action movie.  John Hurt and Randy Quaid contribute superb performances, and Paul Smith does a convincing job of portraying the sadistic prison warden.  (It's a safe bet that no actual Turks were used in the making of this film, which was shot in Malta.)  Giorgio Moroder's disco soundtrack has dated badly, but is still catchy.
The DVD features an anamorphic transfer (enhanced for 16x9 TVs)with an excellent picture.  The soundtrack, unfortunately, is Dolby 2.0 and does not seem to have been remastered; much of the music sounds tinny and thin.",movies
472,72,6540,"This is based upon a real life story! It's been featured on National Geographic's show called=Locked up Abroad!

  In the 70's while boarding an international flight out of Istanbul Airport. A young american named BILLY HAYES is caught attempting to smuggle 2 kilos of hashish out of the country. The drugs were strapped to his body.
Uh-Oh things didn't work out like he planned. While his girlfriend that was with him managed to get on the plane. He got nailed & the story will have you glued from there on.
 He is taken into custody to the powers to be. They laugh & belittle him while stripping him naked{nice tush shot}*For the female fans.

 He is told that he will be released if he cooperates with the authorities in identifying the person who actually sold him the hash. He didn't sell out!
  Billy tries to makes a run for it & is recaptured. He is initially sentenced to serve just over 4 years for possession. With no time for the more harsh crime of smuggling drugs.

 The prison environment is inhospitable in every sense. The prison warden is one mean sadistic animal & he dishes out the worse physical torture as well as mental abuse.
 The other inmates that had been there for a while were zombies from the torture they had been exposed to. You will be surprised @ one of the americans he makes friends with who is still known in hollywood today.
  I saw this movie when it came out on the big screen. I had a huge crush on BRAD DAVIS who sadly died from something close of the content of this movies plot. He did fabulous job & he also starred in SYBIL.It starred Sally Field with JO Anne Woodward.

  This was a gripping story of the real deal{THEN}if you get into trouble transporting drugs overseas. The turkish prison had hellish conditions that unto itself would make any one crazy.
I won't spoil the story line{u have to see it for your self}billy i order to survive had too dig deep into the pit of human strength to grab every oz of fight it took to survive the hot mess he got into. There is a breaking point that had producers in limbo & they walked off set. Billy lost it a few times but that time was a bit vivid be prepared.{BLOODY}
  The movie was based upon BILLY HAYES real life experience who was featured in the highlights in the main menu on the dvd i have & i recently saw his story on Nat/Geo's show called locked up abroad~His account was pretty much close to the same but hollywood amped it up a bit.

 Ive never forgotten this movie!#1 I adored Brad Davis his death was ironic in lue of the subject matter of this film years later. A shame because he had looks & talent. When i watch this movie now i think how sad that he lived a part in this movie that was ultimately his demise in his real life & death.

 It's a poignant look into the world of drug smuggling on an individual level no cartels or glamorized drug rings. He was young it was the 70's sad to say ""everybody was doing it"" here or there. He jus had the foolish guts to do it & it was something he paid for 10 fold.

You are not an American w/freedom if you make those types of choices in a country less than the diplomacy we have in U.S.A.
 The sadistic prison warden i think was harder on him because he was strong fought back & was american. Unlike the native captives under his rule who seemed use to his abuse.
 It was a matter of making an example out of him power trip per say Billy wasn't the only one that got the henoius physical abuse. From the distain the prison warden who i felt like had hatred any way but focused alot more on americans. The famliy notion in the film as touching as his father tried.

It made me think because these things have & do happen to our fellow americans like P.O.W's,Radicals that kidnapp people for political reasons for ransom/& drug smuggling that still happens today.

 A stunning performance by Brad Davis & his determination along with the struggle within was as good as it gets. He had to fight or fall down & live in the hell he put upon himself! It has a well deserved ending & he lived to tell his story & this movie was about his experience.

474,74,7400,"The story of Joan of Arc holds a mythical quality for the French so it is interesting to see how a French director handles such a tale. Indecisively I say: Besson does not seem to be able to make his mind up whether Joan is  a superheroine or some crazy mixed up little girl. Although I loved the  flashiness and imagination of the 5th Element, something is definitely  missing in this film.
It takes Dustin Hoffman's late (and all to brief)  arrival into the film to start giving it the darkness it deserves. After  all, the story seems to be about rebelleion against tyranny, betrayal and  faith.
The period is captured well and the battle scenes capture the gore  and dirt well enough (crows and dogs nibbling at the dead adds another  dimension).
The big question is of course Milla Jovovich herself. She  spends most of the movie bewildered. She tries to capture the essence of a  woman possessed but ends up making a brave although lacking attempt. This  kind of role requires a masterful performance to bring out all the nuances.  The same indecision seemed to be behind Malkovitch's acting - I was  expecting a Valmont (although Faye Dunaway did a good job as the wicked  step mother).
I did like the overblown English accents and the battle  hardened French generals but after the film I was no more wise as to  whether Joan was the messenger of God or a lunatic possessed.",movies

480,80,7516,"Resident Evil is one of those films that I said, ""Ah, I'll wait until it gets to video to see it.""  I didn't expect it to be any good - not really.  How could it be?  It is based on a video game.  Now, I actually liked Mortal Kombat, which is also based on a video game (it wasn't great, but it was fun) - and I didn't know that the same director was responsible for it.  So, I was expecting the worst.  I was wrong.
As someone completely unfamiliar with the video game on which the film is based, I didn't know what to expect.  In short, Resident Evil is about a group of ""security"" personnel who work for a huge conglomerate that is doing all sorts of research - some of it suspect.  One of their more sinister viruses is released and they must go into the secret facility where it is created to try to fix things.  Little do they know that they will be facing all sorts of creepy security devices and ... zombies.
Milla Jovovich is the female lead and she manages to carry the film well.  I'm really not that informed on her background, but I will say that while she probably doesn't have a great depth of talent at her disposal, she is a capable actress and I liked her in her role.  To say that she was believable would be impossible, as I don't know that such a person could exist (how many zombie fighters do you know?).
Sadly, the men in this film are almost interchangeable.  I really didn't know who was who until names started getting fired off and I actually bothered to pay attention.  They all sort of look the same.  There are two other women in the film too, and I didn't realize it until one of them gets injured - they look the same as well.
The interesting thing in this sci-fi/horror film is that the horror aspects were not the ones I found frightening.  It was the sci-fi stuff.  The whole zombie aspect seems to be ground better covered by George Romero in Dawn of the Dead.  In fact, the zombie mythos seems to be taken directly from Romero's film:  they move slowly, they look terrible, and they eat flesh of the living.  If you get bitten, scratched, etc. by one of the undead, you, too, will become one of the undead.
The sci-fi angle worked better for me (and I don't really like sci-fi).  I found the security devices and the assorted set pieces to be very intimidating and frightening.  I definitely was feeling the suspense.
Part of the fun for me was that I DIDN'T know about the video game.  Why? I didn't know what was going on.  The beginning of the film was very confusing as I didn't understand what was happening or why it was happening.  Fortunately, the screenwriters did a very good job of having a few of the characters actually explain the subject to me - and it was done well - as a few of the other characters were designed to be as confused as I was.
The script, the sets, the make-up, and the actors made this a very enjoyably scary film.  I actually recommend it and give it four stars when compared with other films of this genre.
The DVD extra features are rather standard and I didn't avail myself of all of them.  However, as DVD extras become the norm, I think we'll see more and more added features for big budget films and more of the ""standard fare"" extras, such as these, offered:  Director and actor commentary, subtitles, music video, biographies of the actors, etc.
Have yourself a good scare and watch this film.",movies

482,82,1143,"HELL IN THE PACIFIC is a curiosity.  Telling the story of two pilots, one Japanese (Toshiro Mifune) and one American (Lee Marvin), stranded on a small, deserted tropical island during World War II it's at once fascinating and somewhat flat.  Mifune and Marvin are two of my favorite actors.  Their plight on the island, coveting or guarding precious limited resources against the `enemy', more or less drives home the point that war is a futile exercise.  Of course the question arises as to whether we can conquer our distrust before we conquer, or are conquered by, our enemy.  HELL IN THE PACIFIC is thought-provoking and beautifully photographed by master cinematographer Conrad Hall.

  After a while, though, with all the attacks and counter-attacks, I got the feeling that I was in the middle of a Road Runner cartoon with no exit.  This feeling was exacerbated by such scenes as Marvin trying to teach captive Mifune (the balance of power changes a number of times) to fetch a stick like a dog.  It was an ill-conceived scene, brutishly funny if the intent was humor, but added onto the ridiculous ending HELL IN THE PACIFIC seems to have expended its creative energy well before the final credits run.  By the way, I strongly recommend watching the `Alternate Ending' in the Special Features after watching the movie.  It's the right ending for the movie, and it's a mystery why it's the `alternate' one.",movies

485,85,8577,"Yes the movie is filmed in beautiful Montana - though I do not recall any winter scenes and those must be part of what formed young boys growing up there. Equally cold should be the religious view. This is somewhat reflected in the house. It can be especially seen in the contrast between the family of the future bride (why not see the wedding?) Methodists (""Baptists that can read"") and that of the groom - Presbyterians. This might have played out somewhat like the contrast between families in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"". But this does not seem to be the main point. The main contrast is between brothers. Suppose the one has religion and the other has fishing. One becomes a professor: the news sends mom into a most embarrassing explosion of joy. The other wants to be a professional fly fisherman - but there is no such profession. This frustration leads to the conflict in Paul who clearly is not full of joy with anything else he does. Booze and a wonderfully though too briefly developed character of an Indian woman - (if only she could have played a bigger role in more ways than one!) are all that keep Paul from the deep end - even Presidents don't consider fishing with enough seriousness. ""What are you going to catch them with?"" ""The end of my line."" Fishing might hold all the answers - especially if you listen to the voices under the rocks - but society demands something more and Paul can not manage this. For any parent that worries about losing one - or several - how do you know they are saved? - this is a mortal dilemma. Yes, we can love them completely even without understanding, but is this a flaw in Presbyterianism? Is that a sufficiently emotional religious connection with the divine in man? Baptists lose some of their own too - and to the same things. ""Why do the ones who need help the most refuse to take the help they are offered?"" (I am sure I did not get that quote correctly but it is close...) Good question.

On a lighter note, my wife and I argued over whether or not this is a ""chick flick"" or not. I thought yes, she thought no. ""It's just about men fishing!""",movies
486,86,7185,"I was looking forward to getting the chance to watch this movie, after the success of the Resident Evil Video game. But unfortunately, this movie is nothing like the game. The characters aren't the same, and the actual story is different. Sure, it is good to have a different story, you don't want to copy everything from the game, but i think the overall idea of the movie, should be based around the game, because thats what everyone is familiar with. But no, it is completely different, and thats its biggest downfall.
 The characters of the movie aren't properly introduced. There is no background to them, so you don't care if they live or die. It seems that they were more focussed on getting to the gore instead of building up the movie.
 The zombies were my biggest problem. They didn't look scary at all. Half of them didn't even look dead. Looked more human then some of the people i see around in the streets these days.

492,92,7140,"Based on a computer game, Resident Evil actually looks like a computer game:  the characters run around in a maze-like environment, shooting zombies and mutants while a standard video game soundtrack hums in the background.  There isn't much of a plot, just enough to establish why the zombies are there.  Admittedly, with two characters with amnesia and a possible traitor in the group, there is room for a plot twist, but any revelations are mere diversions from the killings.

With more than a few references to other zombie flicks, particularly Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead, Resident Evil doesn't offer anything very new.

511,111,1629,"Jane is an orphan who first becomes a teacher at the rather grim school for orphans where she was raised, then takes a job as governess for a little french girl who is the natural child of a cranky Mr. Rochester. She can't help loving him, and eventually he is equally in love with her, in spite of the attempts of a wealthy neighbor to hook him. They plan to wed, and are at the altar when a man gallops up to the church and announces that the wedding must not take place.

From there you have to either read the book or see the movie; I've told you enough already. Modern audiences will be shouting at her not to be such a prude, but this is Victorian era, after all. And the girl has guts, which finally serves her well. The movie is well done, but it's a pretty bleak story.",movies

517,117,7600,"Despite its Broadway success, Pal Joey took his time reaching the screen. Gene Kelly came to fame in the title role in the original Broadway production of Pal Joey and was the logical first choice for the screen version but when MGM would not lend him out the project sat on the backburner so long that his intended co-star Rita Hayworth swapped female roles to play the older woman who bankrolls Joey's club - on her terms - by the time the film finally reached the screen in 1957.

One of the few Columbia musicals that creates some of its own magic rather than trying to copy the RKO and MGM formula, Sinatra is so perfect as John O'Hara's heel that it is now impossible to imagine Kelly in the role. Not all of the Rodgers and Hart's songs are well served - some, such as I Didn't Know What Time It Was, are all but thrown away - but the score is a strong one (The Lady Is A Tramp, Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered, If They Asked Me I Could Write A Book ) and the film is one of the few successful Broadway-to-screen transfers of its day. Great dog too.

The only real extra on the DVD is the original five-minute trailer, but it's a gem. Filmed on the film's set, with Sinatra introducing us to Joey's vocabulary with the aid of a blackboard and ruler, it's terrific fun and a genuine collector's item! Thankfully that's included on Twilight Time's excellent limited edition Blu-ray release along with a featurette Backstage with Kim Novak, an isolated score track and a booklet, as well as superior picture quality.",movies

Can't wait to see it"" It was a big dissapointment when I finaly saw  it. First of all it completely destroyed the brilliant ending of the first  part. I think it should have been better connected instead of just being  explained as a nightmare. The character of Julie James is still pretty  interesting but all of the new characters are pale  in comparison. There  are a lot of really gory sequences, which are fun to look at but there  isn't as much suspense as in the first. The producers just thought  ""bloodier equals better"" I guess but that just isn't the case.  The ending is a ridiculous repetition of the ending of the first one and I  hope this doesn't mean there's going to be another sequel. If you like  seeing Jennifer Love-Hewitt and a lot of blood then this movie isn't too  bad after all but if you're looking for believeable characters and a clever  story line you're gonna be dissapointed.",movies

523,123,5583,"I waited a long time to see this movie. I only knew that it was the film that John Hinckley watched before he tried to murder Ronald Reagan to impress Jodie Foster. Hinckley pretty much tries to do a De Niro in real life, but it's here that De Niro really makes a name for himself. After a few years of low budget films, and slowly working up the chain with ""Bang The Drum Slowly"", and ""The Godfather 2"" He tackles the character of Travis Bickle with reckless abandon. Bickle is a Veitnam vet who after serving over there is lost in America, and he drifts into a taxi-cab company one day to drive a cab. This is 70's America put on film masterfully by Scorsese as I like the clouds of smoke coming from the cab which reminds me of dream sequence. The dream is dead as no one wants to be the hero anymore. Veitnam has hardened America's hearts and minds. However, the same people that ""Turned On, Tuned In, and Dropped Out"" are still doing it in the 70's, but this time they do it from behind a desk as they are now no longer dirty hippies, but clean-cut businessmen, and women. They have now taken the stance that it just doesn't matter anymore. I see this as Bickle sees the drek that NYC has become, and how people just don't want to deal with you, or know your pain unless you do something for them, and this is evident when Bickle sees Betsy played by Cybill Shepphard. Betsy is a campaign manager for the canadate for the President of the United States, and Bickle wants to volunteer, but to get close to Betsy. Well anyway it's 1976, and Veitnam has been over for a year, and the Christian revival that went down in Dallas in 1972 has waned out, and this is what we're left with as Bickle has 1,001 nightmares in the backseat of his cab, but the one that touches him the most is a 12 year old prostitute played by Foster who had only done Disney movies before this. Bickle decides to help her out, and gives her money, and then does the next big thing which is to kill her pimp which gives him 15 minutes of fame, and he is labelled as a hero for doing this. I feel that this is what was going on in Hinckley's mind when he went to D.C. to murder Reagan as Reagan in his first months as President would make alot of changes that are still rippling through America today, and some aren't for the better. I guess this is why ""Rocky"" beat out ""Taxi Driver"" for best picture of 1976 because with ""Rocky"" it's about a person who came out of nowhere, and took on the champ in the boxing ring. This is what America had come up with to heal the wounds that Veitnam left on her as with ""Rocky"" it gave America something to cheer about again where ""Taxi Driver"" was about an Anti-Hero that killed bad to bring about good?, or did it? I mean it was bad enough that the main character served in Vietnam, but to make him a hero because he killed a pimp to save a 12 year old prostitute was not America's cup of tea back then. I don't know if it had anything to do with the fact that it showed the negatives, or what, but those who did go to Vietnam they deserve the honor and respect that all our servicemen deserve. Perhaps the final scene is rather memorable as Bickle picks up Betsy in his cab, and drives her home as she's going that way, and all of a sudden because he killed the pimp she's looking at him in a different light now as someone she may want to date. However, Bickle isn't buying it now as yes he made a mistake by taking her to porno movie, but after he tries to apologize to her, and make things right it takes him killing a pimp to get her to think differently about him well that's too much. This is a movie not for the kids definitely, and probably not for some adults either. It's a taste of how Americans, and humans in general have been pretty much isolating themselves from each other for one reason, or another, and it's a sad thing to see happen, and over 30 years later it's still happening, and in some ways it's worse today than it was in 1976.",movies

That's unfortunate because other than that scene and one other scene that's sexual in nature, this would have been an excellent movie to watch with a church group.

530,130,5450,"I have purchased and viewed all of Wes Anderson's films in the past month or so and I have got to say that I am thoroughly impressed. Rushmore, probably his most popular and acclaimed film, is an interesting story focusing on one character (very uncharacteristic of Anderson), Max Fischer. The Royal Tenenbaums, in my opinion, is TECHNICALLY his best achievement to date. The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and The Darjeeling Limited were both solid entries that I thought were great despite a lack of a certain something (still trying to figure it out). Fantastic Mr. Fox was an extremely well done stop-motion film adapting a story from Roald Dahl. My FAVORITE however is his debut film, Bottle Rocket.

I have now seen Bottle Rocket three times (in the past like 2 months) and on the third viewing, I decided to take some notes. What resulted was a 13-page in depth analysis of the themes and threads pumping through the heart of the film. My favorite aspect of Bottle Rocket is the character development. The character, Dignan, I believe is the most completely realized character of any of Wes' films and possibly the most tragic. Loneliness is the most prominent theme in the film, Dignan being the vehicle for the theme. Through my intense note taking, I was able to find some things that some people may not have picked up on.

Observations: After *successfully* breaking Anthony out of a voluntary hospital, Dignan and Anthony take a bus back home. On the bus, as soon as Anthony begins to talk about his emotional disturbances, Dignan switches the subject because he is uncomfortable talking about emotional problems.
""You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and CRAIG."" - Dignan. The fact that Dignan uses a first name probably signifies that Craig is the step-father i.e. daddy issues.
Throughout the film, Dignan tries to cultivate a relationship with his former employee Abe Henry, whom he looks up to as a father figure.
Dignan recruits Anthony and Bob into his ""team"", brother figures. The film depicts Anthony's sibling and Bob's sibling, but never shows or mentions Dignan having siblings. Only child = loneliness.
Dignan is very much a child trapped in the body of a control freak/army commander type guy. He throws tantrums but at the same time has the urge to be in control of every situation at all times. Anthony and Bob, unfortunately for Dignan, have a much different attitude towards their heists, theirs being more laid back and only semi-committed. Wes even shows us this through the characters haircuts. Dignan has a short hair cut and is even at one point mistaken as being in the army because of it. Anthony and Bob both have long hair that further shows their more laid back attitude. While Dignan plans out their heists to the last detail, Anthony is usually drawing while Bob is wrapped up in his brother.
Also a very minute detail I picked up on was the number of the motel room they stayed in. The room number is 212. This possibly suggests that the two '2s' are Anthony (who has Inez) and Bob (who has Futureman) and the lone '1' in the middle is Dignan. Also the adress of the Lawn Wranglers headquarters is 2215. Again, the '2s' are Anthony and Bob, the '5' is the Lawn Wranglers crew, and the lone '1' is again, Dignan.
""He thought he had a team, turns out to be a man alone. Now, that's tough now. Real tough."" - Mr. Henry speaking of Dignan. This totally captures Dignan up to that point in the movie and really foreshadows what happens during the final heist where he is let down by his entire crew and in turn is the only one who is punished for the 'attempted' crime.
The ending is very bittersweet. On one hand, Dignan is in jail but on the other, it seems like he is growing up. He makes belt buckles while in prison and tells Anthony and Bob that they could give them to Mr. Henry (who totally used Dignan to get closer to Bob and ultimately robs his house) and Apple Jack (who was caught at the scene but the charges were dropped because of his medical condition). He also jokes to Bob and Anthony about an escape plan which shows that he has accepted his fate. This is truly a coming of age story.

I could continue to go on about the analysis (and trust me, I COULD), but I want to touch on other areas of the film. First of all, the acting is absolutely spectacular. Owen Wilson's portrayal as Dignan is one of the most 'real' performances I have ever seen. It definitely helps that he co-wrote it with Anderson. Luke Wilson was also great as Anthony. There is one scene that really shows his talent. It is when he and Dignan are stuck on the side of the road after their car breaks down and Dignan refers to Inez as the ""housekeeper"". The look in Luke's eyes after he says that is actually kind of chilling. That takes skill. Robert Musgrave was definitely well suited for Bob and his performance is definitely on par with Owen and Luke but he was just given less material to work with than them. James Caan gives a very unique performance as Abe Henry. It was an odd but effective choice. AND YOU CAN'T FORGET KUMAR! Nothing makes me laugh more than when Dignan walks in on Kumar sitting on a couch while he should be cracking a safe.

Style wise, this is probably Wes Anderson's least ""Wes Anderson"" film. After Bottle Rocket, he really defined his style and stuck with it for the rest of his career. The cinematography by Robert Yeoman is simply superb and he manages to craft some stunningly beautiful shots. The music by Mark Mothersbaugh is indeed effective while the choice of already recorded music by Anderson is great. I found that ""Seven and Seven is"" by Love and ""2000 Man"" by The Rolling Stones define the scenes that they are played in and Anderson continued to burn scenes into our memories through his use of music in the rest of his films.

Making a long story short (too late), Bottle Rocket is in my top 10 films of all time. All the characters are just so rich and fleshed out that I find it irresistible to come back and continue to watch and enjoy there little quirks and mannerisms. I just find it amazing that all of the newcomers (Wes, Owen, Luke, and Bob Musgrave) met each other (obviously Owen and Luke didn't meet up, haha), created this masterwork, and now are all famous and successful (not so much Bob). This film gets my absolute highest recommendation if you have yet to see it. I urge you to watch it multiple times though so you can really catch the genius and depth of the characters. Also, check out Wes Anderson's other movies, especially The Royal Tenenbaums, which also delves deep into it's characters and is considered by many to be a near masterpiece.

On a final note, I also CANNOT WAIT for Moonrise Kingdom to come to my town. When I found out that it was initially only being released in New York and Los Angeles, I almost lost it. I have since cooled down and decided to appreciate the films I already have by him to their fullest before worrying about Moonrise Kingdom.

533,133,9144,"ANNIE is better today than when it came out.  Little Aileen Quinn seems like a real child, and whenever the camera is on her, there's always some real emotion in her face and in her voice.  Her singing voice isn't perfect, but it's real.

Too bad the movie doesn't keep its focus on the children more.

Carol Burnett is insane in the part of Miss Hannigan, sheer genius, and she staggers, coughs, sucks down booze like Lee Remick in DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES.  Every time she sees a man she gets high, her endorphins flying around the room.  She's got to be the easiest girl in town, and she makes it all seem natural.  It's a brave performance, and I notice that when she reforms at the very end John Huston has her do so in miniature, at the bottom of the screen while quarreling with Rooster, almost as if to say, he doesn't believe it either.

Most of the numbers are very well done, except perhaps for the bizarre ""I Think I'm Going To Like It Here"" sequence.  Sorry, I just don't believe for a minute all those servants cavorting snd dancing with the sheer joy of serving Oliver Warbucks.  It's a spectacle without any foothold in reality.  What are we supposed to think about the plutocratic rich?  My sympathies are with the bearded anarchist who throws the bomb over the balustrade, the assassination attempt thwarted by that darn Sandy.  The whole moral of the story is, as Ann Reinking suggests to Albert Finney, that his priorities aren't correct.  ""Why do you love only money and power and capitalism?  They'll never love you back.""  The truth is, they do love back.  The movie could have shown that capitalism is, not too put too fine a point on it, evil; in fact, viewed at in one way, ANNIE is a spectacular, near Brechtian demonstration of the evil of money.

Everyone's very good, excepting perhaps Ann Reinking, who plays the sweet, refined Grace Farrell, Warbucks' secretary.  Reinking is a fine dancer but not a movie star, no way.  Even on stage she seems ill-at-ease.  She was the 70s version of Ann Miller, and both of them hailed from the same Land of Wood.  She's got one number, ""We Got Annie"" in which she shows off the dancing Fosse taught her.  Everything else is just splinters.

I remember how awful this movie was said to be back in the day, but give it a shot, there are some wonderful elements to it, and dream of the day when we can see it wide screen to appreciate the inventive choreography in the ""Hard Knock Life"" number, which looks so difficult and anarchic.  If this isn't John Huston's very best film it's in my top 3 or 4 by him.  Is that impossible to imagine?",movies

538,138,4128,"The film  ""Close Encounters"" is one of the best Spielberg ever directed,some would argue THE best and I would be hard pressed to counter that assertion.
This is indeed a wonderful movie ,a film that works on multiple levels and on a grand scale that focuses on the people that have encountered UFOs up close and personal. Spielberg even gave the late Prof. Allen Hynek famed UFO researcher from North Western University a cameo role near the end of the picture to lend it an even more realistic touch.
However Spielberg has stated more than once that he would NEVER release the movie as it was originally shown and true to his word he has so far stubbornly carried out his promise. His reasoning on this point totally baffles this reviewer. It IS a wonderful film,what is the problem Mr. Spielberg?
Therefore if you  would like to see an uncut/original version of this film,NOTHNG at ths time of writing is available to satisfy your desire. Nor does it look promising for the forseeable future.

Not many films have these many bonus features, so this review is more a review of those items than of the film itself  there are already several bonus features on the first disc (the two commentaries, etc), while the second disc is devoted to them.

The first disc has a very long and awesome animated opening, showing the king, the many-eyed monster, flags, opening vaults, angels, splitting clouds, angels flying, more clouds, and the Grail, of course. Scene selections with some animation and sound. Disc One says that it has extras, but its only a bit of animation, and the text to see the extras insert disc 2; no, into your DVD player. Yes whatever  Audio and subtitles, more animation, with the options of Screenplay: Read as you watch!, English, French, Spanish, For people who do not like the film (taken form Henry IV Pt. II, by William Shakespeare), and if you linger on the menu you hear a voice say get on with it!! In the audio, you get a few options, plus commentaries: Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, or John Cleese and Eric Idle and Michael Palin. Hmmm intriguing! Theres a follow the killer rabbit feature you can turn on or off, so that whenever the white rabbit appears on your screen press enter on your remote or click with your mouse and you will either see into the mind of Terry Gilliam or learn the financial secrets of the accountants version. Interesting and more on that later. Of course, what you actually get is a sketch of King Arthurs hand on his first riding into the scene, an accounting rabbit that shows how much the production crew paid for mud in the bring out your dead scene. Helmets and swords for the black knight fight scene cost 500. Sketches from witch-burning scene. Parsnip and string for witch-burning scene cost 0.22.

The hard of hearing part reads out the menu itself (useless, no?). The King Henry IV Pt. II subtitles are probably not accurate, and roughly follow the action of the play. tis Gaultree Forest. Hanging on Hotspurs neck. I feel happy becomes Happy am I. Mention of Falstaff

Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones commentary  the American voice and the British voice  Terry Jones dressed as a woman (?), changing into his cow costume, Gilliam would change into womens clothing (the two don't seem to be in the same room at the same time); ast least thats the scene that they set, and well have to take their words for it. Fun with subtitles and titles the first time they showed it to audiences they couldn't believe it; the cheapskate opening captions also happened because theyd run out of money and needed to eat up time. By maintaining a very low production standard, you can get away with murder; its always dangerous when you try to make good proper films, and you cant really do these kind of jokes, says Gilliam, who by now has worked with large budgets. Costume and setting is 14th century, but Arthurian legends are told in the 14th century about the 10th century. In the opening castle scene youd find one of the busiest traffic spots in London, in Hamstead Heath, directly behind the camera, Terry Gilliam acts as Patsy. All castles in the film are Dune Castle, from different angles. They question the authenticity of having everyone filthy with missing teeth, etc. Lack of close-ups, filming too fast, too primitively, too ambitious to have too many gags in it. Watery tart scene written by all Monty Python members. Black Knight scene shot in Epping Forest. John Cleese (Black Knight) and Terry Gilliam (Green Knight) learned sword fighting for this scene. Took a week to shoot the scene, with no budget. The scene didn't work when edited, so they spliced in scenes of John/Black Knight not speaking and it was fine. Tried dubbing the Black Knight lines with other voices. In New York at the opening, the Vietnam war was on, people were anti-war, didn't find it funny. Hired a one-legged man to do the final leg of the Black Knight. The last leg goes off a puppet. First head-banging monk is Neil Innes. Always obsessed with monks and flagellation and self-abuse. The witch is played by Connie Booth, John Cleeses wife at the time. Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film is said to be Tom (actually, William) Palin. Neil Innes was the seventh Python. The photo of God was WG Grace, one of Britains most famous cricketers. John Belushi and Gilda Radner were at the New York opening and introduced themselves to Terry Gilliam. Terry Jones talks about putting the script together. Terry Gilliam talks about how Monty Python came together. At the BBC, once a show was green-lighted, the cast were left to their own devices. But after four episodes they were almost cancelled, because the execs didn't understand the weird humour, but by that time it was too late  critics and fans loved them! Terry Jones talks about horrendous meetings that they would have trying to decide what to call the troupe and their show. The Horses Spoon and a Basin, Owl Stretching Time, The Toad Elevating Moment, and they settled on Bun Whacket Buzzet Stubble and Boot. The BBC said No, this is stupid, you cant name it something like that. They had a working title Circus, Eric Idle suggested Gwen Dibbleys Flying Circus. Maybe our whole show should be like Terrys animations! Terry Gilliam is the blind soothsayer lunatic who cackles. The Knights who say Ni was always the funniest scene when they discussed and rehearsed it, but they had trouble filming it. George Harrison said that Monty Python were the spirit of the Beatles continuing, since they started the year the Beatles stopped. No ad-libbing, all scripted and rehearsed, so they could shoot quickly (later Eric Idle mentions that he ad-libbed one line into the Bring out your dead scene). Terry Gilliam talks about the difficulty of co-directing, having been a secluded animator, and how Terry Jones launched a re-think of knights roles in society from gentlemen to mercenaries, showing how castles had sealed interiors to protect the inhabitants from their knights (why would that be needed if knights were gentlemen and not scoundrels?). The Tim the Enchanter scene in a quarry in Scotland, great light and sky. The Bridge of Death scene was one of the first shot. Shortened the ending tremendously, moved on to the end, there was supposed to be more dream-like, floating stuff in the end.

Eric Idle, John Cleese and Michael Palin commentary. Shot in March and April. Opening titles got huge laughs at Cannes. There had been a bomb scare at the theatre, though, so the fire brigade stopped the film right after the opening credits, pulled out the audience, and then they went back in and watched it, the audience thought it was a gimmick. Llamas, moose, Nixon, fish of any kind  old Python favorites. Discussion of Michael Palins mud-eating, which is never used/seen, Palin lost it on the 14th take and beat the ground with his fists. Michael is a sweet-tempered man, but even he can be can be goaded to fury by directorial perfectionism. Says Cleese, There is a version of this story in which this outbreak of most unusual bad behaviour on his part  much supported, I have to say, by all the spectators  was in fact occasioned by his discovery of the fact that hed never been on camera at all. I only heard that version recently, I hope its true. One of the rare ad-libs in the movie. He hasn't got s*** all over him  definition of a king. Original film was a collection of sketches that only had Arthur in a few scenes, and even went into modern day, Harrods, and others. The natural world made the film look great. The original soundtrack was one of the first sacrifices of the 16 or so pre-release test screenings. Black Knight scene comes from a story Cleese had heard from 1957 of two roman wrestlers who had become so entwined that the victor died! Cleeses one-legged stand-in was named Richard Burton. The voice of God is also Graham Chapman, so when He is talking to Arthur its really Graham talking to Graham. Neil Innes is the porter whos crushed by the Trojan rabbit. The old historian is also the guy whos not completely dead yet in the Bring out your dead scene. Neil is brought in because none of the Pythons could sing. John Cleese didn't like this scene, he thought that it was too bitchy. Smoke, air of menace. Cleese thought that the Glasgow girls would have been sexier if they were London girls in the Castle Anthrax scene. Lots of snickering about the girls who were cast for this scene. Meta-comment  where the whole scene would comment on itself!! Restored many years later. King and Prince Herberts guards scene John Cleeses favorite scene, he says it twice. Wide shot only, no close-ups. Lancelot running towards Swamp Castle had to be re-shot, because it was blurry, they did it on Hampstead Heath as well. Look carefully, there are two peasants pulling Roger the Shrubbers cart. Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd were major investors early on. Animation after the Knights of Ni second scene introduced to move plot along more quickly. Cleese nearly blown off of the crag. Total cost of film: 229,000. Electric donkey bottom biters!! Idle: Gilliams visual sense is unbelievable. Cleese on the army: We recruited them for fees of about a banana-and-a-half each a week, and they turned up and were immensely helpful and fun and enthousiastic. Thank you, students of Sterling University!

Among the language options you can select to have the screenplay flash across the whole screen. Ironic!

Disc 2  nice animated menu, but nothing too sophisticated.

Singalong  Knghts Of The Round Table (1:25), Sir Robin (1:25) and Monks Chant (2:00), with insitructions on how to use the DVD box to self-flagellate.

Quest for the Holy Grail locations. For 46 minutes, with Terry Jones. Inconsistent with the dignity of the fabric of the castle, was the reason given for not being able to shoot in any Scottish castles, except for the one that they did use, which was in private hands. A lot of hanging around and leaning against the castle. With Julian Doyle, production manager (who was also the arresting officer). Lancelots attack castle. They buy the script at Dune castle souvenir stand, where they have coconuts hanging about the souvenir stand. Theyre told that about 70% of the visitors know the film, 50% come because of the film - some come in chain mail! Dune Castle also triples as Castle Anthrax. The worlds worst name for seductive castles. Budget was supposed to be 150,000. They re-do the lines One day, lad, all this will be yours. What, the curtains? The find the Cave of Kair Bannogh again, its gotten ominously silent. Talking to Hamish Macinnes, leader of Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team. Michael Palin re-creates his catapult into the Gorge of Death. The island castle, Castle Aughhhhh, from the final scene of the film! Talked to the new owner (since 1965), with tales of knightly families losing it in drunken bets Find some local kids, put them onto camera to re-create the final charge scene with four kids! Even up to the arrest scene!! Organ outro music over credits. Directed by Julian Doyle!!

Sacred relics: Coconuts. Ministry of Coconuts gives information about coconuts for nearly three minutes! Gorilla gloves! Earmuffs, kneepads. Teaches how to knock them to sound like horse hooves. Japanese version, 8:30, which includes The French Castle, The Knights of Ni. One of the narrators is the voice actor who was the original Lupin Sansei!
BBC Film Night, Monty Python and the Holy Grail Location Report, 17:10. Alternate shots of the knights approaching castles on horseback, Terry Gilliam young and jubilant. John Cleese commenting on the directing. The jokes tend to be secondary to whether it looks good. Smoke in all shots, arty visual effects. How many laughs are there in the smoke? Flying cow. Eric Idle with fuzzy hair. A grail is a bird like a dodo with a very large beak, the grail is never found, its anticlimactic from the start Reading dialogue backwards Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Island, Chrysalis, Charisma, and Michael White the theater producer backed the film. The French taunters stand-in with non-French accents for the sake of filming (reading from script). Interviewer asks Graham Chapman how many poofters are there in it? Only one that Ive detected, but were not made for each other. Had trouble keeping track of who plays what, and whos left over. Scene of stage hands behind the fake castle wall throwing animals.

Old Rubbish shows nutty items, such as the Investors Preview of the film, old press releases and some visuals. Narrating a radio review of the film from May 1975.

Artefacts contains five film posters!!!

Photos contains a ton of behind-the-scenes items, such as the black knight scene  we get to see Cleese with his arm behind his back, and the mutilated Black Knight puppet, Terry Gilliam as the Green Knight, someone flying over the Bridge Of Death, 35 pics in total.

Trailers contains the original UK trailer, and the US 2001 re-release trailer. The UK trailer runs for three minutes, and is an audition for motion picture narration  in American English, in Scottish, in another Scottish goofy accent, and finally in Chinese!! Awesome scene of a castle cut-out toppling, just as King Arthur knights the mud peasant before killing him (out-take? Goofing around?). At the end, we see that its a Chinese restaurant ad!!! The US 2001 re-release trailer is the same thing, but a wee bit longer somehow and with nicer colours and sleek Now, for the first time on the wide screen cheesy stuff. Ha ha.

Unshot Footage shows Lego Knights (1:43 of the Camelot castle dancing scene, Were Knights Of The Round Table), Location Recce (In March of 1974 two first-time directors disappeared while looking for locations for their first feature film. In 2001 their footage was found in a garage in South London which may finally explain why there was so little money left to make the film itself), shows silly narration over stock footage from any old place, for 2:13) with Directors Commentaries, and Unused Ideas, consisting of 13 fascinating sketches  practically worth the price of admission here!!

As others have said the stories and acting are very good. Wish there were more.
Looking forward to rumpole's return which seen 90% of - didn't see last part.

10/15/2015
IMHO the sound and video is good. Indoor scenes video is better than outside scenes for 1st 9 DVDs. Before the credits at an episode end there maybe a small rectangle with wiggling diagonal lines in the upper right hand corner, all episodes are prefaced by Mortimer. As others have said there aren't any subtitles.
Leo McKern's video titled McKern's memories is ~ 18 minutes long.  The quality of video and sound for the ""Rumpole's Return"" is same as other episodes. All bonus except for those mentioned above are write-ups on a page NOT a video.

Well, Travis finds in his lonely life only a beautiful woman, the really superb Cybill Sepherd, which for me represents life or Eros. But after the sordid incident of the X rated cinema and the killings, Travis carries another more  time this woman in his taxi until her home: I think a clear invitation, really difficult to resist for any man.
But Travis although polite, rejects these opportunity of love and life, and the film ends in following with his taxi in search I think, of more problems, Thanatos or the death.",movies

553,153,3356,"Ok so in 35 years there is still no director's cut? I've heard that this version we all know and love of easy rider is only about 40% of what was the original director's cut. If someone is going to put out a special edition, then supposing we finally see a second disk with the 3 or so hours of deleted scenes? And I mean- a director's cut movie, not just a bunch of isolated deleted scenes. Also, if you're going to add bonus soundtrack items, how about including the Hendrix tune from the movie, which I think is about the only one i remember from the movie that is not in the original movie soundtrack lp. But.. besides me wanting to know what the other 3 hours was like, this movie is all time classic independent american cinema and highly recommended to anyone over 18. It has great performances by many folks down to the louisiana locals who were used to make the movie more authentic. The trip scene was bizare for its time and arguably even for today, but very relatable, if you are 'experienced'. The scenery is absolutely stunning (watch it in WIDEscreen). And it's a great look at a country polarized by cultures and an unpopular war (sound familiar?) Buy the movie but save on the 'extras' till the 'extras' means the whole 4+ hours movie.",movies
554,154,862,"I have used this now for a few months and have found it helpful.  I already knew that I was having problems with a nervous bladder, but when I experienced a prolapse, I was frightened.  After doing some research, I found that prior to any surgery or other medical things, a round of physical therapy would be ordered. I decided I'd rather do this in the privacy and comfort of my own home. Tasha Mulligan is a PT and specialized in this area. The anatomy and explanations are well done and well presented for visualization. This was important - and helpful - to me. Also helpful, is the quiet, matter of fact voice, the pace of the workouts, and her counting. I can't count, concentrate and exercise at the same time - I need someone else counting!  It took a full month of using this on the FIRST set of workouts, before I could slightly feel the muscles move.  It was in the second month that I began noticing the improvement of bladder issues, with the other nice side effect of seeing a slightly thinner waist and stomach muscles. The third month, the prolapse was not bothering me.  I have followed up with my OBGYN who let me know I was doing the right thing and encouraged me to keep it up.  I'm still only doing the first and part of the second sets of workouts.  I am well-pleased with the results and grateful that Tasha Mulligan put it out.",movies
555,155,6611,"This movie can be watched over and over again, and remains a wonderful mix of spectacular humor, silliness, pathos, and love. It is an almost perfect blend of all of the above. Darryl Hannah does an acceptable job, and Steve Martin is absolutely perfect.",movies
556,156,7075,"Resident Evil: Apocalypse begins where the first film left off as Raccoon City has become a sweltering pot hole for T-virus infected zombies that seek human flesh to devour.  People seek refuge outside the city as the Umbrella Corporation, which is responsible for the mishap, has risen walls around the city in order to contain the virus within the city.  When it becomes apparent that the T-virus has reached the outer wall the Umbrella Corporation shuts down the passageway out as the remaining people within the city are left to fend for themselves.  One of these people, Alice (Milla Jovovich), has just awakened inside a hospital where she is attached to several different machines that monitored her health, and once again she has to fight for survival.

The struggle for survival turns the film into a roller coaster journey that goes up and down, but unfortunately it seems to stay down most of the time as the action sequences become too cool, almost godlike, which removes any atmosphere of fear, or trepidation that Resident Evil should arise.  The true horror, which was an element in the first film, is wiped out as the film instead attempts to offers a cinematic experience through shoot 'em up action.  There are some interesting scenes such as Alice running down a wall, and the Nemesis attack on the S.T.A.R.S. station, which leaves one survivor.  But overall, Resident Evil: Apocalypse does not provide much fright or scare.  The action sequences, at times, feel awkward and more humorous than suspenseful as the characters are supposed to struggle for survival.  When some poor soul is about to die, it becomes slightly predictable as if some formula was concocted in order to save the film.

The film does not overcome its negatives as in the end the film does fall flat, but there are some highlights in the story.  For example, the film has interesting cinematography, good lightning, and cool special effects.  These positives only make it bearable to view the film as the story seems to be hurried and unfinished.  Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a distilled cinematic version of the video game by Capcom, but the film does not move the near heights of the video game as the film is purely a trip to the shooting range, which leaves an empty feeling within.",movies

575,175,7034,"The sequel to Resident Evil, Apocalypse pales in its shadow.  Resident Evil was a guilty pleasure that provided decent entertainment.  Milla Jovovich did a decent job of playing a action-heroine.  I only wish the sequel managed to achieve its predecessor's quality.

Milla Jovovich did manage to learn one thing about acting: she surrounded herself in the sequel with actors of such a caliber that in comparison is an Oscar caliber performance.  Yes, everyone else in the movie is that bad (although they do have wonderfully stereotypical accents).

The plot is also so disjointed to lose all logic.  First a virus is unleashed around the city so the evil corporation puts a wall around the city to keep the zombies in.  Makes sense so far, but for some reason they put mercenaries in the midst of the city for no discernable reason other then to provide ready victims.  And from there the plot continues to flounder.  What ultimately ruins plot is that is composed of specific action sequences taken from the games with a narrative designed to bridge the gap.  A big mistake.

The ending of Apocalypse (following the final battle) is the best part of the movie.  It promises a sequel that escapes the shackles of the game series.",movies

The visual and audio for the film were pretty good (especially considering how many different times this movie's been re-edited, re-shot, etc.).  The documentary (over an hour and a half long) seems to squash any necessity for an audio commentary.  Seeing how a lot of these physical effects were done reminded me how far film effects have gone over the years and shows how the little experiments can pay off big.  Included are some deleted scenes (almost all I believe come from the previous versions of the film) and some trailers.  However, the main reason for this purchase for me is the film itself.

586,186,1171,"Woody Allen is a great filmmaker who has made some comedies that are also deep character studies (Annie Hall, Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters, etc.). However, there's something to be said for films like What's Up, Tiger Lily, Play it Again, Sam and Sleeper -- films that are just plain funny. Probably the best of these is Take the Money and Run which spoofs the true crime documentaries of the time. Allen plays Virgil Starkwell, a hilariously inept career criminal whose life is one misadventure after another. Using ""testimony"" from people in Starkwell's life and cinema vierte style photography, Allen peppers the audience with hilarious sight gag after sight gag. Among my favorites:

1. In high school, Starkwell joins the marching band ... as a cello player. The image of Allen running up the street with chair and cello in hand, stopping for a moment to play a few bars, then getting up and running a few more feet in hysterically funny.

2. Starkwell invites his girlfriend (played by Janet Margolin of ""David and Lisa"") to dinner but doesn't have the money. He breaks into several parking meters. When he tips the maitre'd, he dumps several dollars in change into his hand and all over the floor.

3. Starkwell robs a bank, but the teller can't read the note he hands him, thinking that the word ""gun"" is ""gub.""

4. When entering prison, one of the guards frisks Starkwell, inducing peals of ticklish laughter.

Indeed, Take the Money and Run seems a lot more like a film by Allen's former colleague on Your Show of Shows, Mel Brooks, than like one of his later films. The story is just a framework for gag after gag -- most of which are unbelievably funny. Allen did some wonderful and deep character studies later in his career, but Take the Money and Run is a hilarious comedy that should stand among his best work.",movies

A refreshing, entertaining, and witty horror comedy that makes fun of the vampire genre with some good ideas, gore, self-referential jokes ( Before "" Scream""), great special effects by Richard Edlund, wild vampire make-up effects by Steve Johnson and it's just a down and out fun yet original vampire movie with a cult following, it's one of the best from the 80's next to "" The Lost Boys"".

The DVD is quite good in picture and sound quality with the theatrical trailer, this is a must own movie for fans of horror comedies and vampire flicks.

Also recommended: "" Vamp"", "" The Lost Boys"", ""Fright Night 2"", "" Evil Dead II"", ""An American Werewolf in London"", "" Demons"", "" Cemetery Man"", ""Underworld"", ""Vampire Hunter D"", ""Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust"", ""Blade"", ""Blade II"", ""Lifeforce"", "" Demons 2"", "" From Dusk Till Dawn"", "" Night Stalker"", ""Scream"", "" Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" ( Movie and TV Show), "" Dog Soldiers"", "" Bram Stoker's Dracula"", "" Def by Temptation"", "" Bordello of Blood"", "" Wolf"", "" Van Helsing"", "" The Hunger"", "" Blood: The Lost Vampire"", "" Dead Alive"", "" Hocus Pocus"", "" Salem's Lot"" ( Both versions), "" The Forsaken"", "" Habit"", "" Martin"", and ""Subspecies"".",movies

591,191,976,"Made on the heels of the success of Superman (1978) and not afraid to drop names, this is not quite a superhero film. It is more akin to a 007 spy film, even if at times it resembles the Pink Panther films, being filmed in several European locations and even with music by Henry Mancini. A better photographer and a better director could have done wonders with just that.

The first event in an Istanbul cafe is quite close to a Clouseau movie, but it quickly distances itself from that feel.

The film was quite ambitious for that Disney period, with lots of potentially exciting chases (which never quite get there,) we get custom spy cars & a Rolls-Royce chase, laser shooting speedboats, a sky lift escape, a helicopter and a mechanical wing contraption, which sometimes works and sometimes does not.

Oliver Reed as the villain is an absolute mess, but the two male leads (Michael Crawford and James Hampton) have a quirky relationship that brings to mind The Greatest American Hero (also 1981) down to even having a toothy lead with curly blond hair. Too bad there is no chemistry with Barbara Carrera.

While the description might superficially resemble Kick-Ass (2010), the movie features a comic book artist living out his heroic fantasies, one has really nothing to do with the other.

The animated title sequence is by Richard Williams? The DVD has no end credits.",movies

Air Force One, the most sophisticated aircraft in the sky, is hijacked by a group of Russian terrorists trying to get their leader free from jail. But they did not count on the president fighting back!
With his wife and daughter on the plane, Ford must race against time to save them. Glenn Close, as the Vice President on the ground, becomes acting president after Ford is presumed dead. She tries to talk down the terrorists, the leader played by Gary Oldman, in his most terrifying role ever. But with no success, it is up to Ford to take them out.
This film has some of the best action scenes in a long time, and the DVD transfer is fantastic. This was released close to the birth of the DVD format, so there isn't a whole lot of extras on it.

Buyer's remorse? No way! I'm in the midst of hours of enjoyment going through this set in order, watching the episodes, the commentaries, the interviews, the special ""Making Of .."" programs, and the other included extras.

I find the video quality of these DVDs to be at a minimum acceptable, and often excellent. But then, I don't expect that a TV series shot on a modest budget in the UK in the 1970's on videotape, can be transformed into a fantastically hi-def TV experience on modern DVDs. I never saw the old A&E DVDs, which I have heard were of disappointing quality, so I can't compare these DVDs to those.

603,3,5511,"I installed KIS 2011 on three of my home computers (2 desktops and 1 laptop) and it runs very well on all three, which is great when you consider that the newest of these computers is three years old!

Installation was easy, although the first thing KIS 2011 did was check for a more recent version of itself, which I downloaded before I installed anything.  Nice to be up to date.  Upon completing installation, I manually updated the virus definitions.  I'm sure the program would have done it automatically given time, but I wanted to update them right away, so I did it manually.

The program has a very clean and organized interface.  Finding what you need is fast and easy.  A big green button lets you know you are safe and protected.  Alternatively, if something is amiss this button will be yellow or red so you can easily tell the state of your protection.

I was also impressed with how configurable KIS 2011 is.  If you like to tweak settings, then you'll love it.  That being said, it also runs extremely competently ""out of the box"" with everything left at ""default.""  It does not seem to slow my computer at all, which is a huge plus.

Parental controls are extensive and easy to use, and include monitoring of time, blocking webpages and keywords, and allowing internet usage.  Accounts can be password protected, so your kids can't change the settings!  Extra features of KIS 2011 include a virtual keyboard (keyloggers can't detect this type of input) which installs into your browser, and is activated on demand by a tiny icon in the browser's existing toolbar.  I thought this was a nice way to implement this feature; no annoying extra toolbars cramping your browser window!

This version has a license for three computers, but be aware that you have to install and activate all three licenses within 30 days of the first one, otherwise the remaining/unactivated ones will be invalid.

In conclusion: I have tried two other 2011 ""Internet Security"" suites, and uninstalled both.  KIS 2011 is my choice for this year.  I'm very happy with it.",software

The only somewhat annoying step was that I had to ""register"" with a Quicken User Name and password, etc. individually when converting each QP2012 portfolio to QP2015 format - that is, it doesn't provide a global ""registration"" applicable to all portfolios. All portfolios were converted correctly and all existing username+password settings for each One Step Update account were preserved.

I don't recall seeing in QP2012, but Q2015 does have useful reports for investment asset allocations.  It also provides an investment ""X-Ray"" feature to capture Morningstar info for investment (however, I haven't used that feature so I can't comment on it further).

Overall, QP2015 (like QP2012 before it, from my experience) is a terrific product.

611,11,3476,"I am an Army Reservist and had to learn Arabic really quickly.  I used Rosetta Stone and couldn't believe how fast I learned Arabic basics.  Well, I'm back from the Middle East and can tell you that what they teach you is applicable and correct.
So, I am planning a trip to Italy in a few months and immediately thought of Rosetta Stone because I only know as much Italian as what I have heard from watching the Saprano's.  I have been using the system for the last couple of month's now and I feel very confident in being able to carry on a basic conversation in Italian and I am only though 1/2 of the course.  I'm astonished.
For those not familiar with Rosetta Stone's programs, they are hand's down the easiest way to learn a language.  Just brief over the basic instructions, put the disc in your drive, and start--it's that simple!  You don't have to pour over manuals, dictionaries, audio discs/tapes or history books.
I've tried Berlitz and many other programs in the past that required all of those other 'tools' and their systems depended on memorization.  Other programs don't work for me.  Rosetta stone uses another approach by allowing you to learn a language in a way that allows you to UNDERSTAND the language instead of MEMORIZING a language. If I can't remember a shopping list, how can I memorize an entire language?

By the way, the US Army offers only 1 language program free to soldiers and it's Rosetta Stone...because it is the only one that works.",software
612,12,7583,"I began my college career as in illustration major. I was able to enter a fairly prestigious program as a result of my portfolio (and truly talented high school teachers who invested a great deal in their students). I left the program after two years ... I couldn't conform to the idea of turning-in sloppy-but-on-time work, especially as a photo-realist. Now, I am a professor of English (film-studies is my specialty). Still, I have never stopped drawing and I have always remained in the visual arts. Recently, one of my film-studies students was telling me that actual drawing is archaic. She wasn't taught pen-and-ink, has never used a tortillon, and did not even know about light-tables. She explained that EVERYTHING now happens on her Mac. What a genuine shock. After significant consideration about how this impacts the art-world (and a bit of mourning for my now obsolete talents), I picked up this software.

I provided this introduction so that you know I am entirely new to this form of art ... but not (at all) to art itself. Therefore, basically, I am speaking to those slightly older folks (maybe somewhere in their thirties) who have yet to make this leap.

As a whole, Painter is surprisingly intuitive. Now, since I was provided a short amount of time to learn this program (before this review had to be posted), I remained in the areas in which I was trained. While there was a considerable learning-curve, I was able to produce a few nice pieces (after a several scrapped ones). As I continue to play and expand into areas outside my comfort-zone, I will update this review. Nonetheless, I can also say that it is exciting to experiment with the options provided ... to tinker with a drawing and then ""reset"" it when I don't like the effects, well that's pretty invaluable. (I do remember those days of recreating a piece because my ""bright idea"" of adding spot color or stippling instead of cross-hatching turned out to be sadly incorrect).

The investment here is steep. But, for many of you, it will be well worth it. My advice is to find someone in your field who already has this, take it for a test-drive, and then assess if it is better than what you are currently using. Moreover, if you are a parent considering this for your high-school student, this is a fantastic program ... in fact, it really doesn't get much better.",software

Altogether it took about 20 minutes, it was a seamless process.  If you know that you want to install on several computers / laptops all at once you're good to go.  If not, you do have an option for later installation:  ""You can always install Sage 50 on additional computers later.""  I was simply installing in on my PC, so opted for the one for now.

One other thing you'll need to consider during installation is disabling your firewall.  I chose to allow my Windows Firewall to work with Sage, but I could also have configured it manually.  There are a few things to consider when installing, but I found it to be an easy step-by-step process with no problems.  I simply closed out everything in the background and concentrated on the installation process.

Sage 50 is perfect for the individual accountant or small business bookkeeper.  Customer support has been spotty in the past and that has been their biggest downfall.  This packet comes with a full year of customer support and online updates.  What I'm seeing and want to see, is easy access for when I need help.  There's online assistance where I can ""manage a case"" by shooting off an email or can access technical support via chat.  Personally I much prefer using phone support when I have issues (866-747-3888).  The proof is in the pudding as they say and if anyone is having issues, later reviews will probably let everyone know how customer support is doing.

Learning curves are sometimes what the individual makes of them.  I'm so far liking what I see.  I was able to take a look at a sample company and could easily spot a section ""Getting Around Sage 50.""  If I can't see anything right in a program or if I have to buy an expansive book I easily become frustrated and will turn away.  Sage has everything right where I want it ... at my fingertips right in the program.  More than likely, the lengthy installation had something to do with this.  I don't want to buy a ""secrets"" sort of book nor do I want to go scouting around on the net to find out something.

I was looking at ""Show-Me-How Videos,"" ""Quick Reference Guides,"" and a list of ""Sage University Courses.""  No further expenditure was needed on my part.  I didn't have to take a pill so to speak from getting a headache looking at a mess.  Everything was laid out nicely and wasn't overwhelming.  Many of the learning areas had drop down menus with additional areas to explore.  I'm going to list what I saw as an easy-access learning menu below.

Do I think I can easily manage and work with this accounting software?  Yes.  Am I confident the company will come through with that customer support that was lacking in the past?  I'm not sure, but that remains to be seen and can't be predicted without more people weighing in.

So, I picked up a copy of CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X4.

I've used Adobe Photoshop in the past, and although I know it is the industry leader among graphics software, I find it difficult for a novice like myself to learn.

When I call myself a novice, it is strictly in the realm of computer artistry.  I'm very adept technically, and work in the IT industry as a senior systems engineer.  I know software.

I figured that with the tutorials and help system in the CorelDRAW software, I should be able to easily learn what I needed to know.  Corel didn't disappoint me.

Not only are the commands a bit more intuitive than those in Adobe Photoshop, but the help system has quickly answered all of my questions so far regarding how to do anything I've needed.  Watching the video tutorials has helped teach me graphics concepts that may never have occurred to me to explore on my own.

The tools in this suite have aided me in creating custom banners, graphics, and editing pictures.  I've found the process to be easy and fun.

The program is a bit slow to open, even on a PC with a 3 GHz processor and 2 GB of RAM.  Once open, however, it responds very well.  The slowness to launch seems to be standard with such programs, however, so I am not sure it is really a fault with the software or if it is simply the nature of the beast.

There you have it - an amateur's perspective.  I'm not knowledgeable enough with graphics to review every little nuance, but for those of you who hope to be able to muddle your way through graphics creation, as I hoped, you will find this a useful and informative tool.",software

621,21,967,"I just finished playing ""Secret of the Old Clock"", and I loved it!  Before I say anything more, I think it important to add that I am 35 years old - so, take it from me, these games are great fun for ANYONE over the age of about 10!

This particular game is set in the 1930's (the depression era), and is about a young girl whose mother recently passed away - leaving her a bed & breakfast/bakery to run.  She did, however, write her friend before passing, asking her to come & help her 17 year old daughter if something should happen to her - and her friend rushed right over, trying to help out, but knowing nothing of the business.

Strange things started happening at the inn at about this time, and both the young girl & her guardian are convinced that she is having a nervous breakdown - that it's all in her head.  Especially since not only is she grieving the loss of her mother, but they are running out of money.  An elderly neighbor (who was quite rich) had promised to leave them plenty of money in his will - but when he died, it looked as though he left all of his money & estate to a man who supposedly taught mind reading & esp.

In comes Nancy Drew...  Is the will originally found the ONLY one?  Could it be a forgery?  And what of all the strange noises & happenings at the inn?  Who's behind them, or are they really all in the teenager's mind?  These are the questions you'll have to answer while playing ""teen detective"".

I found several differences between this game & the other Nancy Drew games I've played to date.  First, the graphics are better - in fact they are just as good as some of the more high-tech games I've played.  Second, you actually get to drive a car (but be sure to watch out for potholes)!  Last, there was much more ground to cover - which I really liked - so you get to see a lot of the town, and speak with several people (rather than just being confined to a house, and only talking to 1 or 2 others).  Oh, there's one more difference...  You actually have to earn money in this game - to pay for gas, car repairs, games & other necessary items.

Overall, I think this game is a ""must have"" for anyone who enjoys (or had enjoyed) the Nancy Drew series.  One of the great assets of these games is that they allow you to choose a difficulty level - but, I must warn all you other adults out there, if you haven't played many ND games (or even if you have!), you may want to choose the ""junior"" level.  This will allow you to get more hints if you need them - and if you don't, you just don't ask for them - as it's the number of hints that will change based on the level you choose to play at.

The basic look and function of the program is so similar to Quickbooks, in fact, that one could easily mistake it for the current king of the hill.

To test this product, I set up books for a small business that I recently started and entered a number of basic transactions.  While some processes weren't as intuitive as I might have liked, it's relatively user friendly and it doesn't take long to get things done.  Like Quickbooks, the internal controls are awful and you can freely edit past transactions with no real audit trail.  This is convenient if you make a mistake, but a major no-no for those trying to run a genuine accounting department.

Office Accounting Professional is a competent program for those running a mom and pop business, but would not be sufficient for any more than that.  Unfortunately, I didn't see anything here that is a real improvement over Quickbooks and because of that, I don't recommend the product.  Because Quickbooks enjoys a near-monopoly in this market, there are several advantages to buying it.  Many bookkeepers and tax preparers will be able to take a copy of your data file and do their work, but none of them are likely to have this product.

I can't speak to the latter there, this was my first ever copy or iteration of this software. It worked fine for me!  Granted, I don't have hundreds of people in here, and oodles of data and multimedia to content with.  Perhaps it bloats out if you have an enormous tree, but it was't the case for me.

I like the way it's laid out, and being a newcomer to the overall genre, I don't have a ton of experience with other pieces of software to compare it to.  To that, I won't have a ton to write about in this review.  I'm a genealogy newbie, and I got the software, installed it, ran updates, and started to use it.  No problems in any regard.

630,30,5034,"This is such a great tool for researching your roots and recording your family tree. These are two distinct tasks: researching and recording. Researching your background is where you find relatives you never knew you had. Recording is where you save the results of your research and report them to your future generations.

The 90-day free access to the Ancestry genealogy records is outstanding. After 90 days, there is a monthly fee and the fee is pretty significant. Check their website for pricing.

One misconception about the research service is that you can find your living and recent relatives. I don't know all the details, but there are privacy restrictions that prevent the web service from giving you info on living people.

All in all, the software tool and the online service are really incredible, but they're not cheap. I recommend you don't activate the 90 day service until you know your calendar is free enough that you'll be able to actually use it. Otherwise, you won't get the full benefit from the service before your 90 days elapse.

Researching your family's past really is an incredible journey. My mother traced one branch of our tree back to the Mayflower. Obviously this research wasn't simple. I can't even imagine how much easier it would have been for her with a product like this.

632,32,560,"This is a justified upgrade for all Office 97, 2000 and some Office XP users. Office has evolved into a system of information gathering tools, a set of solutions for ideas, communication, connecting people and places. Intense XML (extensible markup language) integration for generating solutions that are compatible with today's, tomorrow and future standards. The updated applications integrate with the Windows XP experience featuring a bolder inviting interface. I am disappointed with the default use of the current theme in Windows XP, but with the new tool bar icons, it makes you forget about that. Overall it's a wonderful work experience with Office 2003. The suite offers improved reliability and stability, because of the integration with the supported operating systems. Once the suite is installed, you don't have to restart your computer, just start using the applications, the suite even has its own default programs group (finally), which keeps your programs menu less cluttered.
Word 2003 includes development tools that add dynamic features to documents making them powerful than ever. The power beneath all this is XML, allowing the user to embed components for updating data in documents such as stock quotes. Word 2003 offers simple, familiar yet improved features regular users are accustomed to. Majority of the features in Word 2003 are aimed primarily toward businesses and the Enterprise. But are still necessary for the average user because of the control over information across all the Office applications. Tools such as Information Rights Management (IRM), (this controls the flow of information to specific users), persons can be restricted on how they use your Office files; whether it's printing or sharing, very powerful! Reading view is an enhanced mode of print preview; documents are laid out in virtual pages reducing the need to print. The Task Pane is also improved by offering resources to look up information on a particular topic being typed; this is a feature across the core Office applications. Lots of other great features make Word 2003 a worthy upgrade.
Excel is a XML mammoth because of the integration with the language. The ability to migrate data between different storage sources and extraction of information to make it flexible in different scenarios. Tables can be transferred back and forth between applications such Word with ease. Excel can continually use the tables from documents as a data source for further expandability. It's the flexibility for data exchange that makes Excel 2003 very powerful.
Outlook, is so revamped, this alone is a worthy upgrade. Three panes in Outlook 2003 make e-mail an enjoyable experience. The Mail Pane holds all of the necessary tools found in prior versions of Outlook such as the Outlook Bar, and the different folders such as inbox, calendar, etc. The second pane gives an expanded view of the different items listed in the Mail Pane, like your incoming mail, contacts and calendar, which makes reading these information resources easier on the eye and productive by providing a better view. Reading your e-mail in the third pane (Preview Pane), the user views the message in portrait layout, more content is seen compared to prior versions. Its even better to view e-mails with ""Clear Type"" turned on for Windows XP users. Other features such as improved Virus and Spam protection makes Outlook 2003 a great upgrade. Outlook is not placed on the desktop by default, it can also be minimized to the system tray in Windows, for users connected to an Exchange Server, this displays all the network settings available.
PowerPoint 2003 offers the same features of version 2002, but what makes it an enticing upgrade is the package to CD feature that allows users to save presentations onto CD-ROMS. The PowerPoint Viewer included with each Package to CD allows it to be played on other computer systems even if PowerPoint is not installed. Windows media integration is also in PowerPoint 2003, which makes watching presentations more fun and exciting. The effects are fantastic when combined with these elements. The ability to integrate videos into Presentations to create home movies has long been a request of users, even if they have a DVD burner. For the PowerPoint 2000 user this is a worthy upgrade that provides simple yet Powerful tools to take presentation graphics to a new level.
This new version of Access is also XML integrated, enhanced features such as extraction of data from multiple tables, Access 2003 also improves Smart Tag integration. The ability to design solutions within the program makes web services a powerful resource for the enterprise; the flawless integration with Microsoft SQL makes information sharing a productive experience. This makes data storing and retrieval an easy way to control how data is implemented across many scenarios using personalized solutions, allowing your information to have a stronger impact across the Enterprise.
Publisher has become a mainstream Office application because of its integration with other Office programs. It connects to product databases; the Mail Merge feature is much improved because it's the same one as Microsoft Word, which offers greater ease of use. The Start Center is awesome, which makes starting publications an organized experience for the user. The interface is less cluttered and more customizable. You can rename pages like Workbooks for better searching, if you are typing large publications. The website features are easier to use; it provides satisfactory integration with FrontPage, for converting websites created in Publisher. With a total of 45 design master sets, users can create attractive e-mails that are fully compatible with many messaging services. The ability to merge data sources using text and images is great. Compatibility goes back to Publisher 2000, which is a draw back for users who might be using Publisher 98 or under.
Outlook Business Contact Manager is an application that offers features for Small Businesses for generating customer reports and e-mailing customers.
Picture Manager has replaced Photo-Editor; it has better image editing tools, more functionality and ease of use.

634,34,4900,"There is not much to love with this set.  First of all, you get four separate programs, each with its own installation disc.  That you means you do four separate installs and have to type in four separate very long serial numbers.  In the Photo Album 7 alone, the program was a separate install from the clip art and the user guide, so if you want those, add two more installs to that list (although without 2 more serial numbers).  That annoyed me right in the beginning.  Then, the programs are very light on functionality and limited in options.  The photo program offers no more than I get with the free program that came with my Canon camera, and if I want more functions than that, it tells me I have to buy and install yet another program, Paint Shop Pro Photo.  I was very unimpressed.  The one capability it had that was value-added for me was the ability to burn a disc of your photos; my other photo program doesn't have that.  The paint-it program turns your photo into a painting-like image, which I can see would produce interesting images if you wanted a stylized version of your photos.  I rarely want that; I really want to see my photo in all of its glorious detail.  I already have scrapbooking programs that are more functional than the one that came with this set, which is a little bit tedious and annoying to use.  I selected the ""Hip to Be Square"" layout and tried to drag photos to the large boxes in the center of the page, but I was not allowed to do that; you can only drag a photo to the boxes labeled ""Drag photo here.""  This is pretty restrictive in terms of the creativity you're allowed.  The panorama plus is a nice and rather useful program if you don't have a camera that already lets you stitch images together.

Overall, I just felt that I would rather have just one program with all of these functions integrated into it, and I would like much more functionality than these provided.  They could keep the nice user interface and the simplicity and just beef up the functionality without making you buy more programs.  Of the four programs, the one I would most like to see enhanced for more functionality would be the photo program.  I thought I was going to be able to correct my photos much more extensively than this program allows.  On the other hand, if you are a beginning computer user with no existing software that does any of these things, this might be a good choice for you, because the programs are not difficult to use and provide basic functionality.",software

638,38,3951,"I've used H&R Block's TaxCut program for Windows, each year for the past 5 years (or more).  I've also run both TurboTax and TaxCut during a few years to see if the ""help"" was better in one or the other (when I was trying to figure out how to answer a question).  Plugging numbers into these programs is not hard.  Determining what numbers to plug in can still be hard.

My experience is that the built-in help behind the questions for the Federal forms is usually OK.  In the unusual areas, I am surprised at how weak the help is - it's there, but not deep.  However, the help behind the State forms is not good - it's shallow at best.

The math in these programs is always right (usually... I did find a bug one year that they quickly fixed in an update), but again, the burden is on you the user to determine what numbers to plug in or when to say ""yes"" or ""no"" during the online interview that these take you through.  In many cases, it's not hard.  But in those hard(er) areas, it can take hours researching what is really being asked.  I've found myself downloading IRS forms and instructions most years to figure out at least one question, and I would not say that my tax returns are all that complicated (I don't have a lot of the odd situations to report).

Getting 5 Federal filings with the price of the full package this year was nice, but paying $19.99 to efile a State Form still feels ridiculously too much.  And in some cases, the Forms needed to file an odd-Sate return need to be paper (they aren't all included with TaxCut), so efile does not work in those situations.  I file 3 sets of forms each year (mine and for 2 of my kids) and this year, the cost or complexities with the kids' State forms will mean paper filing for both of their State returns.

I have not contacted H&R Block for help, so I can't comment on the waiting times to get that help or on the depth of help provided over the phone or over chat (however they do it).

But all of this is still a lot easier (and fun? at least it's a challenge to overcome) for the do-it-yourself type person, than the old paper forms or in taking all the papers to their office and paying them to do it (my opinion).",software

One of the things I do remember was their customer support was rather weak and from looking at a couple reviews, it continues to be weak.

The install was pretty easy but I quickly found I was getting spammed frequently after I gave them my email address. I quickly removed myself from that.

The software looks pretty easy to use; but it's not. I ran into problems just playing around with imports and trying to modify a picture and some text. This is where documentation becomes invaluable especially for somebody who doesn't do this kind of work on a frequent basis.  The documentation does not help.

I played with some minor conversions like a PDF to word and this worked without issue.  There are many features overall but I admit to not trying them all.

One thing they install is a cloud connector piece and I kind of found it annoying as it runs every time you start up.  One thing to consider is if you use this software on a company machine you might violate policy.  You can remove uninstall it without effecting the application.

I am a complete new to computer animation. I was worrying that it might be difficult or very time consuming in getting started.

652,52,3904,"I switched from PC to Mac two years ago once Apple converted to Intel based processors.  One of the main factors in getting me to make the jump was a piece of software called Parallels, which allowed me to run my Windows applications at native speed alongside my Mac apps.  The techie term for this is ""virtualization,"" essentially a ""computer within a computer.""

Mac users are very fortunate to now have two outstanding commercial options for virtualization:  the venerable Parallels Desktop, and the upstart VMWare Fusion.  Although I have been a loyal Parallels customer since its initial release, I must concede that VMWare Fusion 2 currently has the edge.

VMWare as a company is, of course, far from being the rookie in the virtualization market.  On the PC side of the fence, VMWare has dominated  for years with a very mature virtualization engine that runs on a variety of platforms.  That experience is clearly reflected in their Fusion product.

VMWare Fusion 2 is mature, fast, and a vast improvement over Parallels Desktop.  Fusion feels more 'Mac-like,' offers easier printing options, and is noticeably faster on both my Mac Pro and Macbook Pro.  It works with existing Boot Camp partitions as well as a self contained 'virtual machine' that stores itself as a single file on your hard disk.  Virtual machines from Parallels Desktop can be converted to VMWare format.

While the bells and whistles are nice, two things for me sets VMWare Fusion apart from Parallels:

1.  Overhead.  While Parallels has almost a constant 20% idle rate drain on my CPU, VMWare is practically at zero when idle.  Memory usage is more efficient too.  This is significant, especially if you're running Windows programs alongside Mac apps on a notebook where memory and CPU are often at a premium.  When it does need some horsepower, VMWare supports multiple processor cores - something the current version of Parallels doesn't.

2.  Appliances.  VMWare has a very active ""appliance"" community that continually adds value to the product.  Appliances are pre-configured virtual machines that run everything from open-source servers to full Linux distributions.  They are a great way to experiment with some of the great open source software projects without having to go through the aggravation of installation and configuration.  Just download the appliance and boot it up with VMWare Fusion.  In fairness, Parallels does have its own appliance community, but it is nowhere near as robust as VMWare's community.

CONCLUSION

Mac users looking to run Windows and Linux have a great choice between two very capable virtualization apps.  The edge right now almost definitely goes to VMWare.  It not only sports a more intuitive interface, it also requires far less overhead and has an outstanding community behind it.

I have no doubt the upcoming release of Parallels Desktop 4.0 will bring both competitors back on equal footing.  But for now, VMWare Fusion 2 is the superior virtualization application for Mac users.",software

Unfortunately no such manual came with the software. I can only assume the wrong software was on the disk so we are left high and dry.

Since the package is opened, I can't take it back to the office supply store where it was purchased and will have to mail the software and receipt to the company (address in 1 pt font which requires a magnifying glass to read) and the refund will take 4 to 6 weeks.  I tried calling the number on the website and got a ridiculous phone menu run around.  After listening to the options and choosing the one that seemed to apply another recording said a representative couldn't help and to interface with the web instead.  Surely I'd just chosen the wrong option and called again choosing the other option, but got the same message.  Why would there even be a phone number to call if they aren't taking calls.  Very annoying.

I can't speak to the software we expected to receive because we didn't get it, but potential buyers should know that if you have a problem, there is no support.  I'm willing to accept a mistake, but having the package say version 21, the disk say version 20 and different and unusable software actually install tells me this company has very poor quality control.  That coupled with no support  is a disaster.  I do not recommend buying this software.

Update: The website does not list the version 21 software as a choice in the technical support area but I tried another type of search and found it.  I had to email to get the missing password and was rewarded with a list of instructions to follow to get the software to work, including the password.  I'll try it tomorrow.  Hopefully this will help, otherwise the software is still going back.",software

664,64,530,"This is my 17th review and completed adventure in the Nancy Drew series.

First, I'd like to start by dividing my review into two factions.
1) The game itself
2) My personal detective work.

* PART 1 *

PLOT: A lone cabin out in the Pennsylvanian woods and there are ghost dogs that prowl the forest?! Oh my this is going to be exciting!  I was looking forward to some beautiful nature scenery and I wasn't disappointed. Moon Lake and the general lay of the lands [cemetary, speakeasy, sprawling trees] captured my imagination immediately.  The story of Prohibition law-breaking and rum-running really caught my attentions and found myself absorbed in the newspaper clippings and the desire to find the gold bars. This plot line was one of the Top Ten stories HER had to offer us players thus far!

INITIAL SCORE: 93

CHARACTERS:

Red Knott: This weird bird watcher that observes avian only at night gave me the creeps as I thought I caught sexual innuendos when I talked with him in that treehouse. "" If I do this this for you, what are you going to do for me? [long pause] and ""Pretty girls should be okay out here"" [something along those lines].  I immediately went into ""stranger-danger"" mode and kept to the cabin when he was around. And he ALWAYS was!

Emily Griffen: Her twangy voice was peculiar and I had her pegged as my # 1 suspect I think mostly because I felt force-fed information about the other two residents and didn't want to buy too much into these evidential setups.

Jeff Akers: The park ranger with the big aspirations and familial ties to the mob had all the makings of a culprit served on a platter. He had motives to get the land back into public hands, rumors of hidden gold, etc.  I loved reading all the information in the ranger station which could be opposed by many of the young gamers who ""don't want to be educated like they were in school"" ha, ha.

Vivian Burnett Whitmore: She has to be on my Top Ten list of ND characters based on how funny it was talking with her and the information she provided me [relationship with the gangster Mickey Malone, the four rottweilers] and the key she mailed over.

Beth/George/Hardy Boys: Again, didn't care for the Hint System, but I know I always had a place to call for a good laugh [my girls!] Dialing the phone feature was VERY tedious!

CUMUL SCORE: Even = 93

SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:
Based on how I used to enjoy the woods in my youth, the visuals was absolutely perfect; especially the moonlight sequences!  The speakeasy was lovely, but there really wasn't much to do except examine paintings and I was frankly disappointed. The thuggy jazzy score set up with stirring moody numbers brought my mind back to the roaring 20's.

CUMUL SCORE: + 3 = 96

PUZZLES/MINI-GAMES:  Now that I think about it, I don't think there were ANY mini-games. I know the puzzles revolved mostly on collecting items [bird pictures & critters] and staying focused on the makeup of the dogs colored collars and such.  Not  bad in any sense, but when you compare that to other ND games, those captured your attention more. In this game it was a slight let-down.

CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 95

ADVENTURE ENDING: I got to see the evidence into making the actual ""ghost dogs"" and loved the cuteness of these canines [although wanted to release them from their cage].  I guessed the culprit!!!! That makes my rating about 45%  All-in-all, I was pretty pleased.

CUMUL SCORE: Even = 95

* PART 2 *

I try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to
take weeks! Well, it took me two days [8 hours] and I gave myself a
Detective Score Of : 82

My Strong Points: I pushed through at a pretty rapid pace and never really got into any entanglements from puzzles or stuck in plot line devices. The water valve puzzle was solved with my screwdriver ingenuity and the tunnel navigation was nearly flawless.

My Weak Points: I guess I missed it when Vivian said Waldo's other name, because this puzzle kept me grounded in thought needlessly. I died on the rotten floorboards, ha, ha

OVERALL GAME SCORE: 94 + 82/ 2 = 88.5 [ B + ]

BOTTOMLINE: I agree with other gamers that the ghost dogs were underutilized. The fact why I don't consider it a problem was that this wasn't a horror movie, this was an adventure.  I was quite occupied with the engaging storyline and not worried that I was going to by chased through the forests with my life at stake. Although missing the A grade HER so often does, it is one of their top adventures in the series thus far.

Thus far, on my list of the 19 completed ND games, GHOST DOGS ranks.... # 1 !!!!!

665,65,6345,"After spending countless hours trying to get Turbo Tax, which I'd used for about 10 years, to fill in and calculate my taxes correctly, I gave up and bought H&R Block At Home Deluxe + State 2011 instead.  The download took less than a minute and installed quickly with no problems at all.  H&R has a feature that can get your info from last year's Turbo Tax but since I'd had so much trouble with Turbo and was concerned that it might get this year's instead, I started from scratch with adding our information.  The whole process went quickly and it filled in and calculated our taxes.  It was able to handle the HSA account info accurately and without a glitch.  This was what had caused the problem with Turbo.  It also took me through itemized deductions, interest and dividends easily.

The interface isn't as graphically appealing as Turbo Tax, but it's easy to use and did my taxes accurately.  I was able to download the state version for free and it took less than 5 minutes for it to install, get my info from the federal taxes and fill it out.  Both state and federal seemed to go faster with H&R and it was very straightforward.  I'll be using H&R Block from now on.",software

669,69,6250,"This review is for TuboTax 2011 Deluxe for Federal Returns. Fortunately I live in Texas and there is no state income tax so I don't have to worry about the state portion.

TurboTax has had its share of issues but I came back to it because it does seem to be the best there is, but I'm knocking off a star because of the history of issues I've had with the program in previous years (like it not calculating tax correctly until I deleted some assets and then re-entered them). However, I was a little shocked to read that it requires 515MB of HD space PLUS up to 1.5GB more if Microsoft .NET 4 is not installed (Mac is only 330MB). Wow! That could be over 2GB of HD to do taxes (last year it was over 1GB). How inefficient we have become!

Fortunately the system requirements says it works on 64-bit systems, and now it specifically mentions Windows 7 64-bit as well as Vista. When I installed it on my Win 7 64-bit machine, installation (mid Jan 2012) seemed to go well without any problems. When it checked for updates, it found 4 updates at 13.2MB and they all seemed to install properly... so no major install issues for me (unlike 2 years ago), however I did have a minor issue. I accidentally canceled the initial updates because the program responded slowly when I clicked the Update button and so I clicked it again. The problem was by the time my 2nd click ""registered"", Turbotax had changed the button to a 'Cancel' button. No big deal though but a little annoying.

NOTE: Deluxe will do a Schedule C just fine, but it may not provide as much help as the Home & Business version. If you have been doing taxes yourself for awhile then you might not need to pay the extra money for the additional help.

I will update this review as I continue to use the product.

Pros:
* Price includes federal E-File
* Overall, probably the best tax program there is
* Does not say it works on Windows XP 64-bit (but does with 32-bit XP with SP 3+)
* Works on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Vista and Windows 7
* Deluxe version can do a Schedule C for the self-employed - but it doesn't provide as much guidance as the Home & Business edition
* Claims ""100% guaranteed accurate calculations""

Cons:
* Not perfect (but how can US taxes ever be perfect)?
* Have encountered bugs in previous years that caused me to have to delete and re-enter assets
* Might take over 2GB of HD space on Windows according to the system requirements

Other:
* Their marketing continues to be ""guide you step-by-step like a GPS"" to get your max refund... hope it doesn't make mistakes like my GPS does sometimes! But they seem to have toned it down this year (good if you ask me).

Old review:

This review is for TuboTax 2009 Deluxe for Federal Returns. Fortunately I live in Texas and there is no state income tax so I don't have to worry about the state portion.

TurboTax has had its share of issues but I came back to it because it does seem to be the best there is, but I'm knocking off a star because of the history of issues I've had with the program in previous years (like it not calculating tax correctly until I deleted some assets and then re-entered them). However, I was a little shocked to read that it requires 500MB of HD space PLUS up to 620MB more if Microsoft .NET 3.5 SP1 is not installed (Mac is only 255MB). Wow! That could be over 1GB to do taxes. How inefficient we have become!

I just installed TurboTax Fed Deluxe on a Vista x64 system (it's Jan 7th, 2010) and didn't have any problems. In fact, it installed very quickly considering that it claims it needs 500MB (but I do have an SSD drive that greatly speeds things up). TurboTax immediately found 4 updates and asked me if I wanted to update. The updates seemed to have installed just fine. ""Uninstall or change a programs"" says TurboTax 2009 is using 343MB. It says TurboTax 2008 (from last year and still on my computer) is ""only"" 162MB, so a BIG increase (but I wonder how accurate are these figures?). In any case, even 1GB of space is not a big requirement nowadays.

I will be working with this to help estimate my 2009 taxes before I pay may Jan 15th estimated tax payment.

NOTE: Deluxe will do a Schedule C just fine, but it may not provide as much help as the Home & Business version. If you have been doing taxes yourself for awhile then you might not need to pay the extra money for the additional help.

I will update this review as I continue to use the product.

Pros:
* Works on 64-bit versions of Windows XP and higher (of course that includes Vista and Windows 7)
* On Jan 8th, I used it to help compute an estimate of the tax I will owe for 2009 to help determine what to pay for my last 2009 estimated tax payment and the program did not crash.
* I had a ""flawless"" install and update on Vista 64-bit - didn't ask for any serial or reg code
* Probably the best tax program there is
* Price includes federal E-File
* Deluxe version can do a Schedule C for the self-employed - but it doesn't provide as much guidance as the Home & Business edition

Cons:
* Not perfect (but how can US taxes ever be perfect)?
* Annoying ""smart"" input entries that try to format things like dates while you're still entering them
* Bad/complicated handling of SEP contributions
* Have encountered bugs in previous years that caused me to have to delete and re-enter assets
* Doesn't jive well with multi-monitors - it likes to pop up windows on various monitors instead of staying on the same monitor
* Might take up to 1.12GB of HD space on Windows according to the system requirements",software

In 2011 I switched to  Kaspersky Internet Security on each PC and the problems stopped.  This year I installed Kaspersky Pure on each system and have experienced zero problems.

675,75,942,"I will preface this review by saying that I purchased the 2004 edition just 3 days before the 2005 edition was released, but Trend did me right and gave me a free upgrade. That's a plus right out of the starting gate.

I originally switched to Trend from Norton after having slowdowns and resource shortages. Norton is very large and very slow, but by and large it worked for me. I was hesitant to make the switch, but I decided to do it anyway and see how Trend's product works. I have not been disappointed. First off, the memory footprint for this package is about half that of Norton when everything is turned on. For me, that's important - Norton takes up huge amounts of memory and slows the system down, where Trend takes up less room and seems to be a lot faster at execution time.

Trend has always had a very fast and very effective antivirus. This latest version is no exception. However, where this package seems to shine most brightly in the antivirus arena is in the timeliness of pattern file updates. Less than a week after the release of a particular email virus, Trend caught it arriving in my inbox and terminated it before it could do anything. To have a pattern for a brand new virus and already be able to handle it is a very, very good thing.

The firewall itself is quite effective and it seems to do its job very efficiently. Where it tends to bother people is in the fact that it is a very quiet firewall and it does not notify for every little thing like Norton or ZoneLabs do. This may or may not agree with you, but for me I'm content that it's working in the background and isn't bothering me with every little thing that happens.

The spyware detection feature seems to have come of age, and even after running SpyBot S&D and Ad-Aware, it still found spyware on my system. It did a good job cleaning up and it did everything very fast and efficiently.

There are a couple of things I cannot test, as I am on dialup. There are new network protection features that allow remote security administration for systems on the network running Trend's suite, and there is also a neat feature that loooks for intruders on wireless networks. Considering that cybersquatting on wireless networks is very common, this is an important feature that should be in all security suites. If you are running a wireless network, this feature will be invaluable.

Trend includes a parental control feature in its suite, and it works in a fashion similar to Norton's and ZoneLab's equivalents. You pick your categories to block, and you're done. However, there is a flaw in their implementation - the blocking only seems to work with MS Internet Explorer. So, if you use Mozilla/FireFox or Opera, you're out of luck if you want to use the URL blocking.

There is also an antispam feature, but it is not going to prevent spam from arriving in your inbox. Rather, it simply flags questionable messages as spam in the subject at delivery. This can help with sorting and disposal, but it will not keep it from being delivered. In my opinion, spam should never reach the email client if you have an antispam solution in place, so I regard this particular feature as ineffective. I suppose it is better than nothing, though, and many users will find it helpful - I don't. I didn't like Norton's, either, which works the same way.

One interesting feature that Trend sports is ""Outbreak Notification"" which is used to alert users when a new, high-risk threat is circulating. Users will get a notification when a new high-profile virus is spreading, and that can be helpful if you're relying on manual updates.

Trend Micro has put together a winner in their 2005 edition of their PC-Cillin Internet Security suite. It does not lack any major features, and the majority of the things they have included are very good and very effective. There are a few soft spots, but these are not critical to system security, and overall Trend is quickly catching up to the ""big boys."" If you want a fast, small-footprint security solution that competes very competently with the likes of Norton, ZoneLabs and McAfee, Trend is an excellent contender.",software

678,78,1264,"Having tried a number of different wireless network adapters that connect to the computer via the USB port I have found that this type of device is much better.  It is more reliable; and faster to give you a connection when logging into Windows. This adapter frees you from problems with sleep mode, screen savers, etc. that USB type adapters may have.  If you use Linux, Mac OS, etc. this device is a nice solution as well.  The installation program is slightly buggy, but I was able to get the device configured and it has worked flawlessly ever since.  If you have a device that has an RJ-45 Ethernet port and you want to connect it to an A, B or G wireless network this is the best way that I have found.  Internal cards that plug into the PCI or PCI express ports are also reliable and might be better for online gaming.  But I occasionally like to be able to move my adapter to other devices that have RJ-45 Ethernet ports like Game Consols, other computers, etc.  Many other companies make similar adapters that only use the B & G type networks.  This is the only device that I could find that can use type A networks that I use.  You can only connect to one router or access point at a time.  The only gripe that I have is lack of some encryption protocols.  I live in a rural area so encryption isn't too important to me.  The encryption types that this device support are dated and insufficient for important business use in a location that would be prone to wireless snooping.",software

681,81,5891,"I've used different copies of Quicken in the past.  Premiere 2004 and 2007 and Starter 2010.  So I am fairly experienced with Quicken and have always enjoyed their software.  Premiere 2012 delivers and I love the ease of use, even more easy that the previous 2007 that I had (although I haven't used it for quite a long time).  I love the ease of getting a look at all my credit cards, bank accounts and investment account at a glance, knowing right away where I stand financially.  Additionally it is extremely easy to see where you are spending all your money and where you can save by minimizing your spending in that problem area (alas, mine are books and games.  I really need to reduce this area).  I haven't used the Bills or Planning yet, and probably won't as I don't really use this for those purposes.

Also, I've seen a lot of reviewers complaining about ads and the fact that the software is only good for 3 years before Intuit shuts that version off.  In regards to the ads I can't say that I have found a single one, except for the Wells Fargo logo that appears when I run an update.  As for Intuit shutting down the software support I kind of agree to a certain extent.  If I buy something I want to be able to use it until I am done with it, not be forced out of using it in order to have to buy the current copy.  That being said after three years I am sure there are improvements that I wouldn't mind obtaining as well as design, both visually and mechanically, that would make the software easier to use.  Buying the software once every 3 years isn't so bad and I don't mind it.

The only con I have found, and this was a lot in the Starter edition and has only happened once so far in this edition, is that randomly the update won't update certain accounts.  Sometimes it goes for a few days to a week before it will finally update.  This is a little annoying to say the least, but it always seems to correct itself and go back live.  Besides the fact that this is essentially the only financial software available I would definitely recommend it.

683,83,156,"This is an old Nancy Drew game. But I've learned not to pre-judge the older games; it's the plot and puzzles that drive these games, not the graphics. That said, this game was not mind-blowing. If you want to go for a classic Nancy Drew title, I would suggest the game that came after this, Treasure in the Royal Tower (#4). I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.

PLOT - 4/5: Nancy is off to San Francisco to help a friend of Hannah's renovate a Victorian mansion. This friend, Rose Green, spent her life savings on the historic home and plans to turn it into a Bed & Breakfast. But strange accidents have been setting back the renovations and if things keep going badly Rose will have to sell the house and lose her investment.

I thought this was an alright plot,  it was very short though. On the back of the CD case it said ""20+ hours of gameplay"", but I finished mine in about 4 hours. Other than that, there were lots of snooping opportunities - in fact, Nancy gets to snoop through all four of the suspects' things. The plot flowed nicely and there was enough progression in the story that I never felt stuck in the same place for too long. But it wasn't as educational as other games have been. I love San Francisco and it would have been great if they had included more information about its Victorian houses, its role in the Gold Rush, how it recovered from the earthquake of 1906, or how its Chinese history influences its style and culture - really, any of those things would have been great because it gave you little tid-bits about each of them but not nearly enough information to be considered ""educational"". Which is a shame really because the plot and setting gave the game the perfect set up; it could have seamlessly put in so much information without having the player feel like ""Oh great, here comes another history lesson.""

CHARACTERS - 3.5/5: The suspect list in this game is pretty straightforward. There are two male suspects and two female suspects (a formula which I believe is pretty common to the earlier ND titles). The suspects include Rose Green, the owner of the mansion, a quiet woman who didn't have too much to say throughout the game. Abby Sideris, a friend of Rose's and is also co-owner of the mansion, who believes the mansion is haunted. Charlie Murphy, a college student and inexperienced handyman helping with renovating the mansion (Charlie was voiced by Scott Carty, who does Ned's voice in the later games). Louis Chandler is an antique dealer specializing in Victorian era furniture and decorations.

The graphics were... interesting - but I wasn't expecting a whole lot considering it's an older game. Louis was probably the strangest to talk to because it would seem that sometimes his eyes would be closed for an entire conversation, which may or may not have been a glitch in my game. The characters were not too memorable. Rose and Louis were particularly boring. I don't know if the voice acting on these characters was just bland or if their characters were meant to be more reserved.

Phone friends included Bess and George, a woman named Emily who is apparently a friend of Nancy's in San Francisco, and Hannah. In the books Hannah is the Drew's live-in house keeper who is practically a surrogate mother to Nancy, and the games also allude to the fact that Hannah is an important part of the Drew family. This was the first time I've been able to talk to Hannah in a Nancy Drew game. But Hannah's voice was really odd, like a young person that was obviously trying to sound like an old woman, so I didn't call her very much.

SETTING - 4.5/5: The mansion was very lovely and nicely decorated. It was pretty big too; Nancy can explore her room, the dining room, the basement saloon, the foyer, the parlor, and the library as well as a handful of secret rooms. I sort of wished you could go outside, or look out a window or something, but I guess the weather was supposed to be bad and that was the reason for staying indoors.

PUZZLES - 4.5/5: The puzzles were not too challenging in this game. I suppose that if you struggled with them then you might spend 20+ hours playing the game like the CD case promised. But I have played enough Nancy Drew games to recognize a clue when I see one and got through the puzzles pretty easily. My only complaint would be that at times the instructions were kind of vague, for instance at one point a character asked Nancy to take a look at a puzzle ""in the corner"". I spent over a half an hour looking for that corner before eventually looking it up online and discovering that the puzzle was directly behind the character.

IS IT CHALLENGING? No. I'm starting to wonder if maybe I'm getting better at these games or if I just happen to be playing the easiest titles in the series. Either way, I didn't have to use a walkthrough. I did call Bess and George a lot, though. And they were very explicit with their hints. It wasn't like ""Maybe you should take a look at the library again!"" it was more ""Go into the library, turn left, and read the red book on the middle shelf."" Which was sort of a bummer; I just wanted a push in the right direction, I didn't want to know exactly how to solve the next puzzle and what would happen when I did. I would give the game a 2.5/5 for challenge.

ENDING - 3.5/5: The ending was okay. The culprit was not surprising to me. Catching them took me a few tries even though I knew exactly what to do. But it was still a solid ending and the wrap up in the epilogue at the end was nice.

685,85,3518,"I started my experience with the Rosetta Stone software with the Spanish (level 1, 2 and 3).  With the Spanish version I have found that it has helped me understand Spanish as well as speak and write Spanish at a very basic level.

However, it helps tremendously that Spanish uses the same character set as English.  With Japanese you have to learn not only a new language but also a new character set.  It is hard--really hard.  I gave up after set 1 because I was just making too many mistakes and was too frustrated.

I do think that if I had this as a adjunct to a ""real world"" training course that it would be a great supplement.  However, as a stand-alone product I think it is just too hard to learn a new language and a new character set at the same time.  I gave it three stars because it is a quality product and would be great for that purpose.

687,87,4564,"I already wrote a review for Parallels, and it's obvious that I prefer that application IF you know what you're doing.  I'm not discounting VMWare by giving it a lower score, but I want to make some things clear for you, because depending on who you are and what you plan on doing, VMWare may actually be the preferred way to go.

First, know that VMWare is the virtualization standard, regardless of your infrastructure.  They have tons of products designed to allow you to virtualize your machines on a variety of different configurations.  Even if you don't have an OS, there's a VMWare product that can help you.  They're a jack of all trades - unfortunately, they are an expert at nothing.  But they are still the gold standard, and the interoperability of the VMs is effectively what makes them a viable option...again, depending on what you intend to use it for.

Say you're working a class for college.  The professor distributes a VM that has a basic operating system to use as a lab.  99% of the time that VM has been created in one of the VMWare products.  Think Adobe PDF here - yes, you could use third party apps to ""convert"" the document into something you can use, but the Adobe Reader is going to handle it the best.  VMWare is such an application.  If the VM was created in a VMWare application - ANY VMWare application, just about - you can then open it seamlessly into your VMWare Fusion product.  Most you would then need to do is reinstall VMWare Tools for compatibility reasons, but the application will work.

It is this versatility that makes VMWare Fusion stand out.  As its own application it's not the greatest; there are a lot of limitations to customization of the VM, but it will get the job done.  I want to note the biggest thing about VMWare vs. Parallels: Windows 7.  You see, Windows 7 actually puts more work on the graphics card to show you the shiny interface that you see, so if you have full Aero on, it's a tax on your system if the card can't handle it.  Parallels and VMWare use virtual graphics cards based on your actual graphics card; Parallels' version gets stressed, but remains relatively stable and snappy.  VMWare, on the other hand, slows down quite a bit when using the Aero engine.  This is a bit troubling, because no matter what you do you can't change this.  It doesn't matter how much RAM you give the VM or what type of MacBook or whatever you have - it's always slow.  The only thing I've seen that affects it is a faster hard drive, but still, Parallels beats it by far.

Where VMWare also excels is with the older NTFS versions of Windows: 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista.  These technologies work quite well in Fusion - Parallels can also handle them, but again, interoperability and distribution are the keys here. If you're in an IT class that uses VMs chances are it's got Server 2003 running, and having Fusion handy will be a boon to your work.  Parallels does support conversion of the VM, but it's not a clean or easy process to do.

One thing I need to add to this: VMWare's stability is by far and away superior to that of Parallels by a long shot, especially with the recent 3.1 release.  What this means simply is this: If you want speed and don't really care about stability or support, Parallels won't let you down, but if you're willing to take a speed hit if it means your VM remains stable and well supported, go with VMWare.  Hopefully that's clear to all.  I realized afterwards I didn't clarify that point well.

In short, do I recommend it?  If you're in school, or you work in an environment that uses VMs or you are constantly called upon to create VMs, or for whatever other reason VMWare is part of your daily life, yes.  If you're just doing this for yourself, VMWare will be easier to get into than Parallels, is more stable, and better supported.  Parallels is more powerful, faster and more seamless than VMWare.

The utility is easy to install and takes up little in the way of resources. I run a very recent install of Windows Vista and had no issues setting up the software.

Once installed, you are asked to enter a name for the vault and a password for it. You are given a series of three choices of multiple security questions to answer in the event you forget the password.

This is not high-end file protection. It has a number of flaws that would allow a sophisticated hacker to gain access to the ""vault"" without too much trouble. There's little chance the Pentagon will be calling McAfee soon use this for any national secrets.

696,96,64,"It took a little over an hour for me to do a full media install of  Glo Premium on my ASUS, Windows 7, laptop.

Glo's features are listed in the Amazon's Product Description so I won't go into those.  I've been using this program off and on for a few weeks now. I think the loading time..switching between the lenses, topics, multi-media, etc..sometimes takes a few seconds  but is fairly quick for such a large program. If I ever become an owner of a tablet, IPod Touch or IPad, I plan on downloading the Glo Bible IPad app & syncing my notes and/or bookmarks to the device. I hope to prepare presentations for Children's Church. By the way, the collection of media in this program is amazing. There's HD video,  articles, photos, art, 360 degree virtual tours & more. I needed to use 'Help' to learn how to find my way around.

As a test,  I did a search for Galatians 5:22; first it turned up nothing, but then I did a search in Galatians & also on the home page both searches pulled up the verse, 2 photos and a map. Clicking on the verse took me to the Galations 5,  the highlighted Bible passage, study notes and a map. Clicking the photos brought up the photo, its description and other pertinent info.  Clicking on the map brought up even more information. By the way, the amount of information that is brought up can be overwhelming.

Check out The Glo Blog, News & Updates on All Things Glo, g l o b i b l e. com / blog/  to learn how to use Glo in your presentations, and the usefulness of the right-click context menu. Clicking on 'Features' at the top of the page might be helpful to you too. Be sure to use the 'help' menu in this program too. If the web address isn't showing in my review, just do a search for Glo Bible Blog to find the web page.

This program has many features, as I used it, I could only think that it needed a few more. To make this program perfect & even more useful to me, I'd like to see the following added:

Audible dictionary; I'd like to be able to click on a word, go to the definition & also hear how it's pronounced.

A few more Bible versions; currently it has NIV 1984 & 2010, KJV, The Message & ESV. I'd like to see NLT added. I'd also like the Bible versions in parallel format so I could read the same passage in different versions side-by-side.

I wish the Bible timeline also showed the events happening in world history.

And, I  wish the Life Application Notes were included.

In my opinion, adding these items would make this software perfect!

This program is huge with many, many interactive features; it can be overwhelming. Take your time, don't feel intimidated & soon you'll be comfortable with the wealth of information found in Glo Premium.

UPDATE: I recently rec'd an IPod Touch & added the Glo Bible App; now I have Glo Premium on my IPod Touch, it syncs with the program on my laptop. Some of the Premium features are not included in the IPod app. I'm loving this on the IPod.",software

If you do register, be prepared to spend about 9 minutes speaking to customer service. This is rather incredible that in 2011 you still have to do this.

Apart from this rather annoying start, I have to say that PagePlus is a great piece of software. And complex. Luckily, the opening splash screen offers some help in the form of online video tutorials and also a 256-page User Guide. The quality of these guides are actually clear and pleasing to view, quite educational. The included Quick Start Guide gets you on your way if you're not a manuals reader like me. There is a LOT of very useful information here, if you have the time to go through them.

I was able to very quickly open one of numerous design templates and create a newsletter. The design templates come in a variety of colors and themes so for the newbie, it's incredibly useful--you can quickly create anything from calendars to scrapbooks, business cards, all sorts of fliers and posters.

The newsletter template I was using had two inserts for graphics which when clicked on opened an Import Picture window with a choice to either link or embed the picture. The process could not be easier! The layout is well-thought-out: to the right are the panes for choosing colors, lines, transparencies and schemes in addition to those for creating new pages, picking swatches (in RGB or CMYK format) and even a gallery from which you can choose cartoon icons/symbols and other graphics. The bottom bar holds a storage place for graphics and other media that may end up in your work.

The great thing is the end product which is available as an industry-standard PDF for publishing  or as a graphic. It is also possible to send the project file directly as an email attachment. In addition to all this, the features and tools available are staggering, from a ""LogoStudio"" for designing logos, to a built-in PhotoLab photo editor and even an Image Cutout Studio that enables the user to edit out or in backgrounds and other graphics. Truly outstanding.
I have to confess that I didn't think too highly of this product when I started because of the hassles I had with registration, but with each use, I see even more reason to like PagePlus.

The simple reason is they often cause problems, particularly performance related problems, and as a result wind up being disabled altogether. The fact is it is very difficult to make a comprehensive security suite that functions on as many as 21 different versions of XP, Vista, and Windows 7, with differing levels of service packs, and any number of potentially conflicting installed software that comes with or is preinstalled by browsers, ISPs, OEMs, etc. By using a standalone product you can exercise total control over what's being controlled and easily identify any problems or conflicts.

It comes in four separate discs. So be prepared to take a while to install these as you have to keep putting one in after another. A better way to do this should have been to put it all on one disc with one serial number instead of four different discs.

I started trying out the Create It! first since I usually will adjust pictures I have taken. I found this one to be extremely slow to open and I accidentally had set the default program to open JPEGs as Create It! This means, I can't just scroll through my album of pictures and it took a long time for this come up. I've had many times that it took so long that it timed out on itself and it had to shut itself down.

I was excited about the Scrapbook disc since it says it also makes cards and I love to make cards. I found it to be really more for scrapbook pages more than anything. And I had a hard time getting a good looking enough card for my purposes. So I gave up on it and went back to my old Microsoft Word method of creating cards.

The other two discs were OK. I tried some pictures with it. It was fairly simple to use but doesn't do too much besides changing a picture into a painting and that's it. There wasn't anything in there to really enhance it.

This was a good idea for sure but the way it was executed was done a little poorly. There should be just one disc instead of four discs and I just wish they made the programs to not bog down computer resources as much.

719,119,3430,"Rosetta Stone's language software is fantastic. Their total immersion approach makes it feel like a play along game instead of learning a language. I had a bit of French in college, but despite the fact that it was a beginning class, students were already expected to know some French. The software outclasses the traditional class. Setup is easy and you can select the options for your level to go at your own pace. Seeing the images with text and hearing the native speaker really does allow for faster learning and you do use your own native ability to learn to better effect. The new Audio Companion CDs are an excellent reinforcement. They make it so easy to load them into a CD player or an iPod. You never feel as pressured to learn the language. I have always wanted to learn French and am loving doing so. The software is nicely packaged with a Quick Start guide, User's Guide, application software and three levels of language for beginning, intermediate and advanced. There are also four CDs for each level for the Audio Companion and an included headset with microphone. It is pricey, but worth it. With regular practice you will become proficient and the software interface is very user friendly. I highly recommend Rosetta Stone and will stick with them for my language learning needs.",software
720,120,7220,"By now we've all heard about the horrors of Windows 8 and I'd have never bought it.  But... I got a chance at a free copy so I jumped on it.  It took a while for me to warm to Windows 7, I thought maybe the same would apply to Windows 8.

I first played with Win8 on a Microsoft Surface tablet PC.  It seemed like Windows reworked for a tablet form factor.  OK, that makes sense. Mostly though, I found it annoying because I couldn't find things.  Nothing was where it was supposed to be.  Configuring and setting up was a pain.

I loaded this version onto a small desktop and tried to use it.  It loaded easily and runs fine, I guess.  The problem is that I don't like to use that computer.  I know where things are in Win7.  I have a working relationship with Win7.  Why oh why did Microsoft decide that I needed to learn yet another way to get things done?  Why did MS decide my old work patterns should change?

I'm hoping that Win8 grows on me.  Maybe it will.  he problem is that I don't -need- to shift to Win8.  Five years ago, I had to stick with whatever Microsoft did.  Now I think I have options.  For example, I'm currently writing this review on a chrome book using google docs.  Years ago I'd have fired up MS word.

Anyways, I'm going to try using Win8 on that computer and I might get to liking it.  Someday, but certainly not now.  I'm sure Win8 is wonderful for someone's first computer, but I'm all trained up on previous  versions.  Using and learning Win8, to me, reduces my productivity.",software
721,121,3425,"I hate this software for two reasons.  Nonetheless, I'm positive it will work wonders for certain individuals.  At this price range you simply must know if you're one of those types or not.  Otherwise you'll be wasting a lot of hard earned money.  Rosetta's licensing makes it so that you cannot resell the software and their ""money back guarantee"" does NOT cover Amazon purchases.  I know because I asked and researched.  You only get the six month guarantee if you buy directly from Rosetta - at an even higher price I might add.

There are basically two schools of thought when it comes to language instruction.  Total immersion or non-total immersion.  The former is like dropping you in the middle of a foreign country without a guidebook or translator.  The latter is like having someone with you who can speak both languages and can answer questions in your native tongue.

Rosetta is total immersion.  I didn't know that when I received the product.  In the past I've used Pimsleur (Brazilian Portuguese) and found it to be effective both in teaching the language and in motivating me to continue.  The motivation part is why I prefer Pimsleur.  There's also a new company on the market with a similar approach called Fluenz that offers a bit more hand holding than Pimsleur which many users, according to reviews here, seem to like.

For many people there's a very basic psychological principle in play when learning a new language.  It's similar to those folks who resolve to exercise and lose weight after New Years.  They start with the best intentions, but many if not most fail to keep their resolutions.  One of the reasons is a lack of positive reinforcement.  If you start out too fast, for example, and get hurt you've just created a negative influence on your motivation.  Some people, however, are quite successful right out the gate and keep going on their own.  No need for a trainer, no need for hand holding or compliments.  They just do it.

Are you the type of person who will feel stressed (demotivation) by not having the rules of grammar explained to you while you learn a new language?  If yes you won't like Rosetta.  Try Pimsleur or Fluenz.  Or are you the type of person who welcomes the challenge (motivation) of figuring out the rules of grammar on your own by using your own observations?  Then you'll like Rosetta.

I am not one of those people who can stay motivated to do an extremely difficult task if I feel stressed out right at the beginning.  I have visited multiple countries and what I experienced only affirms my dislike of the Rosetta approach.  While in South Korea, Thailand, China or Iraq, I found that people assumed I did not know the local language so they either spoke slower or tried to mix English in with their native tongue.  Much less stressful albeit slower way to learn.

In Brazil there is no single ethnic group.  People assumed I spoke Portuguese.  It was the most difficult time I ever had in another country.  I'm not saying I shouldn't learn the local language - no way.  Just that when you're learning, at least for some people, they need things to go a little slower and with a bit more assistance in order to be motivated to keep learning the language.

Rosetta's license is most restrictive that I have ever encountered.  And they enforce their license.  Some users claim that other companies have the same license rules.  That might be true, but they don't enforce those rules like Rosetta.  If you buy Rosetta on Amazon you are subject to Amazon's refund policies, not Rosetta's.  Amazon doesn't give full refunds on opened software.  And after 30 days you're probably out of luck for any kind of refund.  You cannot get Rosetta's 6 month money back guarantee here.  You only get it if you buy it direct from them at a higher price.

The software can be used on only one computer.  No, you cannot use it on a laptop while you're away from your desktop.  The software license requires that you register online in order to access all the exercises.  Once you do this the software is then tied specifically to that computer.  It cannot be registered on another computer.  This means you cannot resell it _anywhere_.  Rosetta customer service told me that they would consider the needs of customers on a case-by-case basis should someone upgrade their system and get rid of their old machine.  In other words, there's a tiny sliver of flexibility here.  But it ain't much.

You simply must know what style of language learning you prefer before purchasing this very expensive piece of software.  Some people, like me, are going to hate it.  Others who like total immersion love it.  Know what kind of user you are.",software

737,137,3576,"I hesitated before purchasing Snow Leopard since I know new operating systems can wreck your computing environment, but the Apple OS upgrades have always served me well, so I went for it.  The installation took about an hour on my Mac Mini.  Perhaps tellingly, I couldn't tell right away that my computer was running a different operating system.  All my settings, dock, programs looked exactly the same.  Only after using it was I able to begin to see what had changed.  NOTE:  I currently have this installed on my Mac Mini only.  I want to wait several months before converting all my Macs to Snow Leopard.

The Good:

-- Start up and shut down is, as promised, faster.  Likewise, Safari is much faster than even the newest update installed on Leopard.  Most other programs run faster as well.  These speed differences are noticeable, so, if you are at all impatient, you might want to upgrade for this alone.
-- Microsoft Office 2004 AND 2008 both work as they did before the upgrade.  I use these programs frequently, and the fear that they wouldn't be compatible almost steered me away from Snow Leopard
-- Time Machine seems to be much more stable in Snow Leopard, and this is perhaps the biggest plus of upgrading.
-- Snow Leopard includes X-Code tools for developers.  I don't use these, so I can't comment except that they exist.
-- Expos is a wonderful tool once put in the Dock, although not all users will need or want this access.
-- Computers that currently run Tiger can upgrade, thus skipping an entire OS (Leopard).  If you haven't used Leopard, you'll notice a huge difference.
-- So far, I have not had any compatibility issues with the applications I use.  Adobe Photoshop Elements requires the installation of Rosetta, one of the optional elements, but, if you don't download it initially, the computer will prompt you to install.
-- The family pack can be installed on five computers, without having to enter long codes.  If you have two or more Macs, the price per machine is quite reasonable.

The Bad:

-- At first, I couldn't install because I didn't have enough space on the hard drive for Snow Leopard because of the presence of Leopard.  I had to get rid of some old videos and unwanted photos to make room.  Once installed, I had the space available to me again.  People who have lots of media on their computers will have a tougher time than those that have less content.
-- The difference between Leopard and Snow Leopard are small enough to make this a desirable but not necessary upgrade.  The difference is not dramatic -- not at all like the leap between Tiger and Leopard.  You'll have to weigh the cost against the benefits.
-- The claims of ""greater stability"" are difficult to test since the original Leopard is pretty darn stable on its own.

Because Snow Leopard is not a step backward, I recommend getting it if you plan to keep your current Mac for a while since future tweaks are often dependent on running the latest operating system.  Likewise, if you have a Mac purchased just before the release of Snow Leopard, you should take advantage of the ten dollar upgrade before it disappears.  Except for those who still run Tiger,other Mac owners will not miss much in this latest OS X.

Because Norton has been getting such a thrashing lately, I thought I'd try other antivirus products.  After trying several, I've come back to Norton.  Yes, it's a really big program and not suitable for everyone.  I would never run it on an elderly machine unless masochism were my bag (baby).  But, it's a good program for anyone running XP on a relatively modern machine.  I like having a standalone antivirus running alongside my standalone firewall.

Norton unobrtrusively scans my mail, and it takes detailed activity log notes, and blocks/removes what it should.

I had no installation problems whatsoever.  In fact, it was a snap to install and register.  2005 did very well at protecting me last year--no virus scanner turned any hidden anything up; I look forward to another year of surfing in safety.

Well, they were all gone. Not just internet browsing history, that would be fine. But last files used in Photoshop, in Word, etc. NOT okay.

Then it said I should defrag the HDs, and when I said to do that, I got a popup warning that 'speed disk' (which I assume is defragmentation??) will delete ALL Windows System Restore points. So, I said, stop. There is NO reason whatsoever to delete system restore points, rather, it should CREATE them before running any sort of fix. I couldn't find any way to do a defrag without the deletions.

I tried the 'find duplicate files'. It was totally indiscriminate, finding files which are shared and parts of applications. It found thousands. No way was I going to go through that list to see what should be removed and what should stay. And there was no way that I could find to do an advanced search - to exclude certain types.

753,153,3768,"I've used Norton products since long before they were acquired by Symantec. I wept when that happened...having had nothing but problems with Symantec's software previously. Over the years, I saw my worst fears realized as each successive version of Norton Utilities and Norton Antivirus degraded under Symantec's stewardship. That changed in May after my subscription to NIS 2008 expired, and I decided (aided by two rebate programs)to install NIS 2009. It appears they finally got it right. Installation was easy (a first for NIS in several years), the program has added new and welcome security features seemingly without increasing system overhead, and nothing has crashed...yet! The program seems lean and mean, and more important, very effective.

It does have one nasty nasty feature...and that is Symantec's insistence in forcing a subscription renewal at the end of one year. The cost of renewal is ridiculously high, and the sudden loss of protection if action is not taken is unconscionable. Personally, I solved that problem when my subscription to NIS 2008 expired in March. I simply switched to the McAfee program offered free by my Internet provider UNTIL Symantec offered one of its frequent rebate programs, which allowed me to purchase NIS 2009 in May for a net cost of $[...].

It ticks me off that the scum prowling the Internet ruin it for the rest of us by making it absolutely essential to purchase protection.

I used the quick install, I read through the short voice recognition exercises ( which is critical for successful results) and that was it, simple and clean. I am not a computer wiz but it installed easily and worked great.

To use the program just open the program, turn on the mic, open up a microsoft page, put the headset that came with the program on, I set up the mic into position then begin a few short test sentences.

There are many free products out there but Nero has always been my go to to edit and burn video files when I want a good quality burn. I had not used recent versions, so was pleasantly surprised to find out that it now has several features to share and even import online videos. This program was easy to install, although it does take up quite a bit of space and needs some good processing power when burning movies so it's no good on the basic laptops.

I was careful given other reviews to not install any bloatware on my machine like AVG Antivirus. It installed easily, and I was able to view and burn movies and music files onto discs. The online sharing features are great as I hardly burn any DVDs/CDs anymore, it's all digital. It can upload the files to a cloud, a mobile device or to a shared network. Absolutely needed.

The new edition has almost too many features and if you're a newbie it's good to take the time to get to know it well as it can be pretty confusing. Especially as they've updated the interface to integrate better with Windows 8 it took me a while to figure out as I was used to the older interface. It supports iOS and Android and also has a play to TV feature that I haven't used.

But honestly to try and do this feels more like a extra waste of money, but it is more of a must if you do have numerous devices, rather than only zoned for one PC. The Microsoft Office 365 is a good subscription, especially more for people with numerous mobile devices that use Office like the Microsoft Surface tablet, a smartphone and a traditional PC. It is more of a must overall if you are working through school, but overall it is not a must download. If you just use it on one device like a PC, it really isn't a must own, unless you have multiple devices and find it a better bet to use MS Office for all of them at once.

764,164,1050,"I've reviewed iWork in the past, and have always thought it was well worth the $79 asking price.  However, with iWork '08, these applications have become MUCH more valuable to me.

Some context: I am a marketing executive by day, and an independent writer by night.  During working hours, I use Pages to create whitepapers, sell sheets, and other items that we used to have to outsource to a designer for a few $K each.  Pages makes documents look so professional, we've been able to take most of this work in house.  In fact - I do it myself, and it takes less of my day to do it myself than it would take for me to manage the outsourced help.  ages is just easy to use, and creates fantastic looking documents.

I use Keynote when I give presentations myself, but use Powerpoint normally (because no one else has Keynote, and I don't want to have to keep converting files).  Keynote opens powerpoints fine, so I can watch/present a presentation without having to have Parallels open.  It exports well to powerpoint, too, so I can work in Keynote exclusively if I want to: for example, when working on a plane and tryin to conserve battery life by NOT running windows side-by-side with OS X.

Similarly, spreadsheets open fine - but I'm a marketing guy, so I may not be the best judge of number-stuff.

For my alter-ego as a wannabe writer, I use iWork even more.  I wrote, edited, designed and produced by newest novel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cluck-Murder-Most-Fowl/dp/1419682644/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cluck: Murder Most Fowl</a>) entirely using Pages '08.  For anyone who has written a book, this means not only writing 100,000+ words, but it also means re-write upon re-write.  I tracked nearly thrity minor drafts of my manuscript through the life of the project.  Some points about Pages:

1. It handled the large files easily.  Scrolling through 300+ pages was fluid on a MacBook Pro.  Even when the illustrations were put in place (27 individual 400dpi images) the file remained easy to manipulate.
2. The spelling  & grammar checks work better than expected.  Of course, you can't rely on these, but they are a necessary aide when dealing with massive amounts of text.  The 'proofread' function was markedly better than MS Word's grammar check, although I missed an ""ignore this rule"" button.
3. Searching for certain words seemed to miss results on occasion, especially when the text was formatted specially or the search term contained punctuation (I submitted this as a bug to Apple, and it will likely be resolved in a future revision)
4. Pages was able to create a print-ready .pdf easily without requiring any extra software.  The high-resolution of the images was preserved (I worried about this, since the app handled them so easily in-line I figured maybe they' been downsampled), ad all formatting remained intact.
5. Sepaking of formatting: I was able to design the interior block of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cluck-Murder-Most-Fowl/dp/1419682644/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cluck: Murder Most Fowl</a>&nbsp;with absolute precision, and I was also able to adjust the design along the way with little effort.

The bottom line is that Pages '08 is even better at producing quality, professional-looking and print-ready documents than the original Pages.  Cluck is ""searchable inside"" (or will be, soon) so you can see for yourself how Pages can produce results.

Keynote
I also use Keynote for personal uses other than corporate presentations.  Interestingly enough, Keynote '08 has been critical to me in the development of promotional videos for my book.  Now, I'm no move director, but with Keynote I can:

* animate objects along a path
* chose from a variety of quality transitions
* imbed movie files (AVI files from my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flip-Video-Camcorder-60-Minutes-Black/dp/B000ONDRFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flip Video Camcorder: 60-Minutes (Black)</a>&nbsp;)
* add text (again, with great font handling)
* control the timing of everything
* export to .mov videos

I was able to create some great-looking (well, I am an amateur, but I think they look great) videos, with hardly ay effort (and about 30 minutes, tops).  If you want to see for yourself, you can find them on YouTube is you search around for ""cluck"" and/or ""book promo"".

Overall, I would recommend iWork '08 to anyone who needs professional results but isn't professionally trained ad/or who lacks the serious $$$ required to purchase more ""professional"" tools. The applications are easy to use, well-integrated with the ""Mac experience"", and produce amazing results.  All for small change.

In the business world, iWork has what it takes to bring smaller projects in-house, which could save huge amounts of budget money AND save time.

I would give this ten stars if I could.",software
765,165,1563,"I purchased a new laptop and it came with Vista and 60 day trial of Norton Internet Security 2007.  Because I am a registered user of a previous version of Norton products I received an offer directly from Symantec to buy Norton 360, 3 PC version for less than the Amazon price even with purchase of the download-for-a-year capability.

The good:

- The download and install of the product went smoothly in about 20 minutes.

- The protection is very broad and covers all the typical types of assaults.

- The controls are easy to manage and tweak.

The bad:

- After the download, whenever I go to PayPal the logon is prevented because the browser think's PayPal's security certificate has been revoked.  Both PayPal and Symantec blame Microsoft, but it worked okay before 360 and it works fine on the Vista desktop I have protected by Live OneCare.  The workaround is temporarily suspend anti-phishing protection, which 360 makes easy.

- 2 days after purchasing the software I went online to load Norton 360 on my second desktop.  The site rejected my order number as invalid.  When I logged in to the Symantec site, it shows I have an active license but doesn't show I have any orders.  After 4 attempts I finally got a response from the Symantec email support team.  It was obvious they hadn't read the details of my problem, only the header.  They gave me the link to put in my order number to download, but of course that is the problem.  The note also warns I shouldn't contact them about the same problem again for 7 days.  I guess I could use my dime and queue up for who knows how long on their phone response support, but that doesn't seem cost effective for less than $50, especially when the result may be the same.  I have contacted the email support team again, no response at this point.  So I am less than a week into a 3 computer license with a year of download protection with only one copy working and no way to get the other copies.  If they do not respond by the time my credit card statement comes I am cancelling the software payment and will unload the software.

I have happily used Symantec products in the past but was never reduced to using their download service or online support.  It appears ignorance is bliss as my experience with the service and support is that they are extremely poor.  So if you do want to try this product I strongly suggest staying away from Symantec's online store and get the CD.

775,175,6594,"The bad press on this product made me very hesitant to upgrade, but the lure of a low price convinced me to at least give it a shot.  I had an old gateway laptop (NV53) with windows XP that my family disliked because it was too slow and it became my guinea pig.

Installation took about 20 minutes and was painless.  I chose to do a clean upgrade and save nothing.  Once it was completed you are presented with the new start screen.  Now, I have read all the reviews and comments about the start button being gone and although that is technically correct it is factually incomplete.  When I clicked on desktop I found the familiar windows screen sans the start button but when you move the mouse to the lower left corner a small popup icon of the start screen appears.  Click that and you are on the start screen again.  So, for all the noise about the missing start button it turns out to be mostly bogus...it is just presented differently.

A lot of noise has been made about difficulty finding ones way around in the new interface.  I can say that this has some merit but is being completely blown out of proportion.  Yes, it took me a little bit to find how to lock the system but it wasn't a big deal.  Getting to the control panel is a no brainer once you find the ""charms"", and most other features work very much the same as with windows 7.  I'll do some pros/cons below but I just want people to know it isn't as difficult a transition as many have made it out to be.

PROS
- Speed.  Office opens very fast, and Outlook was amazing.  I haven't seen much of an improvement in system startup but I think it is still doing updates on restarts.
- ISO burning is built in.  Maybe not a biggy, but just last night it came in very handy for me.
- Start menu organization.  You can customize your start menu somewhat.  This is a plus, but it needs more options.  There should be options to lock the tiles and to change views to list/detail/etc like in folders.

CONS
- I took advantage of the free media center download and had 3 ""blue screens"" during install.  To credit windows 8 it recovered from these automatically with no action on my part.  The blue screen is now a sad face emoticon saying something went wrong, but at least it didn't crash the system.  BTW, media center worked perfectly after this.
- The charms show up when you go to the right corners.  On the laptop using a touch pad i found myself bringing them up when I didn't want to.  An delay value before showing them would be helpful.
- Picture Login.  I thought this was a great idea, but it requires you to do gestures in three areas to create the ""password"".  Maybe fine on a touch screen but not so much on a desktop.  I was hoping i could just click in different places to set it up.
- Apps.  The start menu default apps would be ok for cell phones but aren't adequate for desktops.  I clicked on music thinking it would bring up media player but instead it brought up a different program that wanted me to add media to sky drive.  The good news is it takes very little effort to remove these from start.  A better option would be to allow you to click an option for desktop only and ignore the ""baby applications"" I as started thinking of them.

So here is my verdict, if you are looking for something fresh or have an older machine that is slow I'd say go for this update.  The speed improvement made my old pentium laptop hum again.  If you are happy with windows 7 you won't get a lot out of upgrading.  I have a newer I5 desktop that I think I'm going to upgrade while the $40 price is in effect, but I'm not in a hurry to do so.",software

If you're looking for Internet Protection software for you PC or Mac I would recommend getting a more in depth version of McAffe such as McAffe Total Protection.

McAfee Live Safe works with Android, IOS & Kindle Devices (and pc's macs). So you won't have to worry about your smartphone,ipod, or tablet being compatible. McAfee LiveSafe is similar to other versions of McAfee and comes with a built in Virus software to help you protect against Malware,Spyware and of course other Viruses that may infect your device. It also comes with a slimmed down version of a Firewall called ""Web Security"" which you can switch on and off at will, however in my experience it has never interfered with anything I am doing online unlike some other firewalls so i always keep it on for extra security.

What is special about McAfee Live Safe is that it is a universal licensed product. Meaning that for 1 yr you can protect as many devices as you wish with only once purchase of the code. Unlike some protection software that only limit you to one or three uses you can use this on 10, 20, 30 devices if you wish.

So I took the plunge and bought the real thing.

I haven't used the MS Office apps for some time, but lately I've needed to do some serious doc creation with them.  This is by far the best Office--I did consider buying 2007 to use on Vista, but the UI changes on the Windows version are too confusing.

I've had no inter-op problems with this version of Office and 2003 and 2007 on Windows, for both PowerPoint and Word.  Note that with the missing scripting in Excel, this Office version is not quite full-featured, and that costs it a star.  Furthermore, there's still stuff in Office that doesn't keep up with the simplicity of Pages and Keynote--Editing table cell borders is still a pain, aligning pictures in PowerPoint is tedious, and so on.

If you're fighting with OpenOffice and wondering why it's so slow and crash-prone, upgrade to the real thing.  If you're coming from previous versions, know that this is, by and large, pretty stable and fast.  I am puzzled why saving a 30 slide PowerPoint takes a good 30 seconds on my Mac Pro (it's so annoying I had to turn off auto-save), and Word and PowerPoint both do crash sometimes--but this is a great solution for those documents that need to be shared with others and thus Pages and Keynote do not get the job done.",software

782,182,2282,"I use Photoshop CS3 and Capture NX to work with digital images. I welcomed the opportunity to work with and review CorelDRAW graphics Suite X4, during my short inclusion as an Amazon Voice member.

Let me start by saying that this is a very complex piece of software, not for the novice. As soon as I opened Corel Photo Paint (the software consists of two main pieces of software: 1) Photo Paint and 2) Corel Draw) the interface looked intuitive and simple. But when I began to try and do some things that I typically do in PS or NX, I was LOST! This should not be surprising, these are all different pieces of software!

That said, within a few minutes I had discovered some of the elementary image adjustment functions and really liked how they were arranged. To adjust color, saturation, brightness, and a few other parameters, open up the image adjustment lab and go.

The program runs VERY quickly on my Dell XPS 720, Windows XP SP3 box with 3 meg ram, fast HD, and decent video card.

The software is vast and this review only chronicles my initial impressions. It takes time to get used to new software but my initial impressions lead me to believe that I will be exploring this software further.",software
783,183,3725,"If I could change my star rating, I would give it only 2 or 3 stars.  When someone invents a way to protect computers and web browsers from viruses without bogging down the computer, I'll be the first to try it.

Cons: After using this a couple times I found that it increased my computer's ""boot up"" time to over 2 minutes longer than it was.  Most spy-ware or scanning devices have the same problem, so I don't see anything here that makes it stand out from any other software. I have to turn ""Intelligard"" off completely to do any web surfing.  I didn't pay for DSL so I could have my browser slowed to a crawl by the PC tools program.

There is also no easy way to uninstall it!  It won't show up on my list of programs on the control panel, nor are there any instructions in the help files on how to get rid of it.  So, in a way, this PC Tools program has become like the things it is supposed to be protecting my computer from!  It takes up memory and I can't get rid of it.

Pros: It's easy to use, and gives you options as to what you might want to delete versus not.  It describes the risk level and type of risk, even offers to save a ""go back"" point/version in case you decide you deleted something you shouldn't have, and need to ""go back.""  Keeps a history file so you can see later what was removed.

I liked the option of having it automatically download and install updates without my having to affirm window after window in order to do so.  I also like that I can use it on up to three computers at home.

It didn't hog up a ton of memory on my hard drive.  It found several things that Norton and McAfee missed.  I had tried ""ad-aware"" but that program only caused more problems than it helped- (buggy, slow, incomplete coverage, etc.)

Overall, I'm very disappointed with this program and the way it has slowed my computer down to a crawl when starting up.",software
784,184,9441,"If you've tried a number of sketch or paint programs like I have, you might already be too discouraged to try this one.  But don't be.  This one's different.  Sketchbook Pro 7 has much of the simplicity of programs that don't do half as much as well as the functionality of much more complex and hard-to-use programs, but it is easy to use and has amazing functionality for such a simple program.  You can choose any size or shape brush, or you can create your own, and the tools are quick to switch to.  I read where a pen device is recommended for this program, and I agree.  Unless you're good at drawing with your touchpad or mouse, a device that allows you to draw the usual way with a pencil-like instrument would be much better.  I don't have one of those, but I would definitely get one if I had a majori project to do in this program.  The program is relatively intuitive, although there were some things I didn't figure out on my own.  Fortunately, there are a lot of helpful videos available for this program, so you won't have any trouble.  Check out Kevin Mellon's videos on YouTube.  If you're an artist, I think you'll find this program exceptionally good.  Even if you're not, you'll have fun playing with this program.  The main problem I had was that I received the product without the serial number and key required to get it started, but I sent a message to Autodesk, and the individual who replied stayed with the problem until it was fully resolved.

786,186,8361,"As an amateur photographer I enjoy noodling around with various photo editing software and have used several iterations of Photoshop Elements, Paintshop Pro, and Lightroom.  Cyberlink PhotoDirector 5 Ultra is new to me and I must say I was immediately impressed by some of the features.

For one thing, Photo Director didn't try to grab and re-catalog every picture file on my hard drive as some other programs do.  It allowed me to select the photos I want to open.

PhotoDirector didn't balk when opening CR2 files (Canon RAW).  With some other packages, I've had to open and convert my RAW files to JPGs in the camera's software before the software would open with them for further editing.  Since that's a non-issue with PhotoDirector it saves a lot of time.

PhotoDirector includes a lot of editing features; some are standard in photo editing packages (Tooth Brush, Eye Blinger), others were new to me (Body Shaping). I found the separation of Skin Smoother and Wrinkle Remover helped with control and produced a less ""plastic"" looking result.  I like the Content Aware Removal and Smart Patch, but these are two areas that are going to require some practice by the user. I also like the Watermark Creator and WaterMark Templates that are included.  If you're a social media user, you can save and upload a photo to Facebook from PhotoDirector. If you're into HDR photography, you can bracket up to 5 shots with PhotoDirector.

Any photo editing software that does this much has a learning curve, especially if you're used to another package.  So, I was also impressed that the PhotoDirector 5 package included a 117 page manual in the box, including a list of hot key shortcuts.  There is also a handy Help link that is both indexed and searchable so you can figure out how to accomplish an effect while you're working.

What I like most about PhotoDirector is that it does some of the things I commonly need with my photo editing, but have been switching between other programs to accomplish - opening and preliminary editing of RAW files with camera software, to basic clean up and editing with PS Elements, to Watermark and Slideshow with Lightroom.  For basic needs, PhotoDirector has simplified my work flow.

Professional photographers will want to go the PhotoShop / Lightroom direction, but PhotoDirector is great for people who want to do simple editing for personal use (family photos, Facebook, etc.).",software

794,194,3128,"While I can review a computer game after ""beating it"" - often a week or two after purchase - with Norton 360 I waited several months after installing it to come to any judgement. There is always a learning curve with any serious software product where you tweak the settings, learn what combination works well for you, and so on. I really feel a serious package like this should be tested out for many weeks - not days - before a decision is made about it.

I run Norton 360 on my main home PC, from which I run several websites. This means I am running database development software, graphic editing software, video editing software, logging software and much more on this machine. Plus I'm a game reviewer, so I'm running some pretty intensive games on it as well. My machine does a great variety of things. You would think if an issue was going to trigger, that I'd probably trigger it.

I definitely agree that you need to spend a little time setting up the software to work well with your surfing and net patterns. Someone who does a lot of networking operations might need ports more open than someone who just reads email and wants their computer locked up tightly. Now, that being said, the interface is rather straightforward to do this. Once you set it up, you're all set.

I haven't run into any issues with Norton 360 once it was set up well. Yes I had to do some tweaking to get my various POP mail accounts working - many of which are customized and using non-standard ports. It was a one time operation, and has been set since then.

In terms of the quality of the anti-virus software, I always give Norton very high marks. Our cable company provided free anti-virus software as part of our cable bill. Virusses got right through their ""shield"". When I put on Norton, Norton instantly spotted those virusses and eliminated them without any fuss.

I completely agree that some systems out there might have issues with this software package, just like some people are deathly allergic to peanuts. Where an XBox 360 is a perfect clone of every other XBox 360 out there, every PC is unique. Every person has different internet settings, different mail software, and perhaps most importantly, different virusses and spyware that have snuck on your system. Undoubtedly there is always going to be some unique blend of these things that causes a system to crash - with OR without Norton 360. In general, though, I really feel Norton 360 should work extremely well on most systems.

Well recommended - but as always, back up your system before beginning, and have your network documentation handy so you know which specific ports you happen to be personally using, to keep those open.",software
795,195,1629,"McAfee is one of the two top providers of protection software for the PC and this latest package is ambitious as anything they've ever done.  Long gone are the days when they just put an anti-virus program on the shelf, this suite includes a firewall, backup options, spam filters, parental controls, and an advisor that warns you when you're visiting a web site known for activity such as tricking you into downloading adware.

In many respects, it's difficult for an individual to truly test a package like this because you're not going to slam your system with viruses and engage in all sorts of risky behavior just to see if the software protects you successfully or not.  I can say that I have had no problems with the package and it appears to be doing its job.  The feature that has been the most obvious helpful so far is the SiteAdvisor which warned me about sites offering free screensavers and similar come-ons to infect your computer with adware.  It's also warned me that certain sites spam you with excessive emails if you sign up and has generally helped me stay clear of trouble.  It does it in a fairly low-key way but is very helpful.

I gave up using anti-virus programs some years ago because I'm pretty careful about what I put on my machine and I simply couldn't stand the constant barrage of popup messages from the programs that were nothing but reminders that they were on my system.  In effect, they were early forms of adware more annoying than some of the viruses they were there to protect me from.  Thankfully, McAfee seems to have realized that this software should keep a low profile unless it has something useful to offer and I've been very satisfied with its performance so far.  I would especially recommend the product to those who register with a lot of web sites or download a lot of material from the Internet (or friends).",software
796,196,6984,"Before working with Cyberlink PowerDirector I had not used any Cyberlink software beyond PowerDVD, an old version of which came with a computer I bought years ago. My first exposure to PowerDirector itself was version 10 and I was pleasantly surprised with the program. Version 11 makes some improvements over version 10. My review will focus mainly on version 11 independently.

Video editing and production software from most vendors works the same as music editing and production software packages. A timeline view allows the user to drag and drop content onto it and there is a plethora of special effects and transitions that can be applied to each element to make transitions easier and smoother. Users comfortable with the likes of Sony Acid or Cakewalk will feel right at home with this method of working.

PowerDirector provides a nice media manager that gives an excellent thumbnail view of all of the available content, and what comes with the package is a very good library of different types of content. The Media Room contains the actual media available immediately (though more can be imported without too much effort). The Effects Room contains a number of motion and blur effects that can be easily applied to visual elements on the timeline. The PiP (Picture in Picture) Room contains several animation elements, mostly drawing effects. The Particle Room contains a couple of motion-type effects that involve multiple embedded objects. The Title Room is for all things text and text effects. The Transition Room contains transition effects that apply to visual elements and made the change between two elements a lot smoother and/or more interesting. The Audio Mixing Room is a simple equalizer and sound balancer for audio elements. The Voice-Over Recording Room allows for direct recording into the production either through a microphone or from the sound card.

PowerDirector provides the ability to capture input from connected devices such as a webcam or a video recorder. The interface to these devices is very straightforward and simple - there's a record button that turns recording on and off, and there is the ability to change the location of captured content and resolution/bitrate settings.

PowerDirector is able to create media in a number of formats, both audio and video. Supported formats include AVI, MPEG-2, AVC, WMV, MPEG-4, MOV, and MKV files. I was unable to find MP3 file output which is a mild disappointment.

My son likes to make stop-motion videos with Legos, and for this task PowerDirector is well-suited. We have been able to import all of his photos at once (usually over 500 individual pictures) put them all on the timeline, change the display duration and create an initial cut at a  video in less than 10 minutes. Cyberlink claims to have fast rendering speeds, and PowerDirector 11 seems to live up to those claims in our workings.

Comparing versions 10 and 11, while there is a speed difference and there is some minor tweaks in the interface to make it a little more aesthetically pleasing, I am not sure that there's a compelling reason to upgrade to version 11 if you already have version 10. The main considerations are the speed improvements and the content, and the content does not seem to have changed too much so it comes down to speed. If the optimizations that make version 11 faster than version 10 are crucial, then it's worth pondering the upgrade. Try the trial version first before committing to see if this is worthwhile.

I like PowerDirector. It's a powerful and easy-to-use video production application that does a nice job of allowing a user to assemble a video quickly. The interface is mostly intuitive and the inner workings are efficient. This is a good package at a very reasonable asking price.",software

799,199,3091,"CorelDraw Graphics Suite X4 is a very solid program. It does most of what Adobe Illustrator does (vector-based graphic design) and much of what Adobe InDesign does (desktop publishing) in one handy application.

CorelDraw would be an ideal solution for a small business or organization that does a fair amount of advertising-creation and publication design in-house. With one application (well-priced when compared to buying both Illustrator and InDesign), the content creator can achieve very professional results.

The app is also friendly to first-time users. It offers more than 80 customizable document templates that will be useful to newbies. While there is still a learning curve for new users, the app has an intuitive interface that will help get the user up and running relatively quickly.

The problem for CorelDraw is that Illustrator has become the default vector app in the design/pre-press community. Professionals should still start with Illustrator and Quark and/or InDesign -- they're the industry standards. While CorelDraw is very good, it would need to be awesome to unseat Illustrator, and that isn't going to happen anytime soon.

CorelDraw has new file formats that enable docs to be shared between CorelDraw and Adobe apps. This is handy, but also shows which format and apps are the most common -- Adobe's. If you're in a design situation where you're going to have to worry about your files working in Adobe formats, you should just go ahead and use Adobe products.

Another thing: Because the Adobe products are the standard, there are numerous training DVDs and books to purchase that can help you get the most out of your apps. With CorelDraw, not so much.

I feel bad for good apps like CorelDraw. I wish I could talk just about the app itself and not bring in a discussion about Adobe's competitive products, but given the way the design industry works -- or any technology-based industry, for that matter -- you always have to bring the front-running application into the mix.

That being said, if you're not a graphic designer or a pre-press operator but are instead a multitasking, Windows-based employee at a company or organization who has been put in charge of creating brochures, pamphlets and the like, CorelDraw will answer your needs very well. If you're someone who doesn't need to share files often with design colleagues, publishing clients or service bureaus (who are most likely using Adobe apps almost exclusively), then you have no worries.

BTW, if you're already using CoreDraw, it's worth the upgrade. The font-identifying tool alone makes it worth it, at least for me.",software

836,36,6740,"Hands down the best picks that I have ever come into contact with. I own the .90 sharps, the 1.0, and 1.14 picks and they are all that I play with now. I have been playing for around ten years and I tend to pick up a pack of picks every time I go to a music store or order any gear online at all. So, I got my hands on one of these at a music store a while back, and went back to find that they no longer had them in stock. Luckily I was able to find them in stock in all thicknesses and shapes on amazon. These picks will never fly out of your hand. I have a terrible problem with my hands sweating, especially when I play guitar. This causes me to lose grip on picks quite often, and these have solved all of my problems. The more I sweat, the better these seam to stick to my fingers. Not to mention that they never wear down, and they glide through your strings like a hot knife through butter. They never seem to snag on the strings, the ultex material is truly the perfect material for a guitar pick.",music

When I first started playing I was using Slinky's because I didn't know any better and I had looked at their long list of folks who use them. Never going back to those.

That said, this sort of thing is a personal decision and depends on what sound and feel fits you best. But you're doing yourself a big disservice if you haven't dropped $5 to try these out.

These are good for heavy metal, but I play a mix of songs that do not always have distortion - without the distortion they still sound rough.

They also helped me play faster and cleaner. These picks are easy to hold and have a nice texture. After a few weeks of pretty much nothing but sweep picking, they haven't worn down much at all.

If you love classic rock from the 70`s turn the distortion to half-way and you will love this pedal. If you love 80`s hard rock or hair metal turn up the distortion anywhere from 3 quarters of the way up to max and you will love this pedal. Even If you love 90`s alternative rock turn up the distortion all the way and you will love this pedal and guitarists are still using it in 2014.

888,88,4591,"So they're flurocarbon strings, which is a fancy way of saying fishing line, but then again most ukes come with nylon strings so these aren't exactly exotic materials.  If you're not used to this style of string it's worth trying, and this is probably a good brand to try since they're good quality and affordable.  Personally I like the feel of a flurocarbon string so after switching my ukes to some of the more expensive strings I decided to switch a laminate uke or two over as well and the Martins are just fine for this purpose.

I have a couple of nits.  One is that they weren't exactly generous with the length.  I could have used another couple of inches just to have a little more wiggle room while stringing up a concert.  And let's face it, the base material can't be expensive at all.  No need to be stingy with it.  And the other is that I don't feel like they're up to the standard of the more exotic/expensive/newer strings out there (Fremont, Worth, South Coast, whatever, basically any specialty string maker).",music

892,92,764,"First, the reasons why I awarded this five stars: the construction is uniformly excellent. Both ends have strain reliefs, the 1/8"" connecter perfectly mates with the plug into which I insert it, and the XLR end is a quality component.

I purchased this specifically to transform the third channels in my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Powerwerks-50-Watt-Personal-P-A-System/dp/B004VQDAQK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Powerwerks 50 Watt Personal P.A. System</a>&nbsp;into something more useable. This greatly expands the functionality and versatility of the portable PA by allowing me to plug in another mic. Since I have three of those units daisychained I was able to significantly enhance the entire system with this simple adapter.

Another reason why I love this is it's noise free. In some environments in which I play there are sources of electromagnetic interference that cheap cables will pick up and transmit. I have not had that problem with this one, so it's another plus.

Overall I am very pleased with this adapter and actually purchased a spare in case I damage or lose my primary one. It's a bit pricier than others I considered, but I feel that the quality and peace of mind are worth the premium.",music

894,94,9299,"The little zippered pouches that come with most mics are nice, but offer little protection from anything but dust. The core of this case is simple stiff foam with five holes that go from top to (nearly) bottom. Four of the holes are round, the perfect size for a 57 or 58. There's a fifth cavity which you can use for small accessories, or another fifth microphone. If you're using a square mic like a e609 or e906 that'll fit in there nicely as well.

The holes stop short of the bottom of the case, so the mics are actually surrounded by foam on all sides. The lid closes pretty snugly when zippered shut. Nothing is moving around in there. There's a zippered front pocket with a flat zippered pouch on front of that. Aside from the microphones in the holes, you won't be able to fit much more in the GM-4 other than maybe a few microphone clips, guitar picks, or handhend recorder.

I like this case because it is small, simple, and very well-padded. I know that I can keep this with my gear and I've got an array of mics ready to go without fumbling with boxes or milk crates. The denim seems very durable, and the stitching is solid.",music

Without a bass cut, and a *mostly* flat EQ (I trimmed the highs by about -4dB), I can't tell the difference between the sound of my amp and the sound coming through the headphones.

#1  This item will NOT fit an acoustic guitar without drilling holes or using nothing but double sided tape to hold it on, the pressure clip is too short for even a thin body Concert acoustic guitar.  The FIX: Roland should have provided 2 clips, a short and a long for acoustic. $0.50 part.

#2 This item will NOT work with Elixer strings, even though they are brass and steel with a very light poly coating.  (I use thin coat Elixers to prevent string noise.)  The FIX:  Notify the public and potential buyers for quality assurance.

#3 The shims and tape included is a bit cheap, no extra tape.  The FIX:  Include extra double-sided tape and a few carbon fiber shims, the little ""pickup cushions"" are retarded and cause the pickup to not seat properly.

#4 The pickup needs to be installed almost exactly, 1mm/20mm ect..  This is NOT a 30 minute job, it could take hours to get everything properly situated.  Possible FIX:  allow more power to be sent to the pick-up, allowing greater versatility.

Apparently, you shouldn't skimp on your XLR cables--something I didn't know until reading these reviews and searching online.

I give this product three stars simply because it works out of the box, without any noise issues that I can hear.

933,133,5454,Great product from a great company. The switch works well - great sounding cable.,music
934,134,3730,"My high rating is not for the quality, but for the VALUE of these inexpensive guitars. With few notable exceptions, (i. e. hand made custom guitars) absolutely ALL new guitars require set up. Any reputable dealer should do some set-up before selling a guitar. Although when you buy a guitar via mail, you're unlikely to receive that service.

But even with a cursory set up, each guitar will change over time. Wood moves. It will expand and contract. Frets bulge from the neck. Someone will need to do those adjustments and minor repairs. Would YOU risk working on a fine instrument without the best tools and plenty of experience?

My reasoning is, EVERY kid who wants to play guitar also wants to modify it. I've been teaching for over 40 years. In all that time, almost every youngster or teenager puts stickers on his-her guitars, draws on them, tattoos them, refinishes or carves them! You wouldn't want them to do that to a fancy expensive instrument.

Also, every guitarist must eventually learn how to work on his guitar: restringing at a minimum, but adjusting action, making small electronic repairs or upgrades. Bolt-neck imported guitars like these (or Squire) are wonderful platforms for learning that craft without fretting about destroying a fine instrument. (Fretting... ha!)

If your young guitar enthusiast wants to learn re-fretting, that's much easier to do on a bolt on neck with no binding like this. Want to hear the difference between pro-pickups and these inexpensive imports? Swapping pickups is an inexpensive upgrade. Even less expensive is trying different capacitors or potentiometers. Your fledgling guitarists may become a computer whiz kid in the future. Some electronic knowledge and basic soldering skills will give him a ""leg-up.""

The fact is, a good guitar technician can make one of these cheap guitars play almost as well as an expensive one. You won't have the bragging rights, but you will have a useable guitar that sounds good and inspires practice.

With just a few inexpensive tools, any kid can learn to level and dress frets. During that learning process, he will make mistakes, but those are also inexpensive to repair and provide a crucial learning lesson: NO ONE gets it perfect the first time. Only consistent daily effort brings improvement. What parent wouldn't want their kids to experience that crucial life lesson?

It is no longer speculation, but a well known fact that music lessons improve other scholastic scores because only daily practice improves any new skill. It doesnt matter if that skill is playing rock and roll, or practicing math. Do it every day, and you WILL improve. Learning music helps inculcate that great life lesson. Learning to fix and personalize your own guitar makes that lesson deeply engrained yet FUN!

NO, as-is, this is NOT a great guitar, but it is plenty good enough for beginners to learn with. With a few tweaks here and there, these can be made to play as easily as pro-guitars so they don't hurt young fingers. And if you consider all the other factors in a child's development, these may be a better choice than funding an expensive guitar.

Over the decades, I've repaired, adjusted and modified hundreds of student guitars and taught hundreds more how to do their own guitar work. That is one advantage electric guitars like these have over other instruments. You would not want a kid to mess around with a grand piano or a fine violin or classical guitar.

Further, the young student can express his individuality, learn to be self reliant, and learn the great lessons of relentless steady effort. Some may think sports provide some of those life lessons too, but with guitar, you don't risk critical injury or regular public humiliation. What could be better for your kids?

These and the Squire brand guitars are a great positive gateway instrument that brings life-long appreciation for music and craftsmanship. They can be a springboard toward learning electronics, circuit design and even some computing basics.

If you are clever and know an experienced guitarist / teacher, you or your kids can learn about economics, how businesses make compromises at different price points, and what is REALLY valuable in instruments. You might just learn what is valuable in life too.

THAT is why I love cheap guitars like these, and this particular model is one of the best for all those noble goals.",music

These work like a light switch...on/off, so I'm not sure how you can rate them as poor.  There aren't really any directions, so it takes a little mechanical knowledge (just a little...it's not rocket science) to make them work.

Quality metal, secure function, and easily replaces posts on instruments already equipped with standard strap posts.

939,139,7707,"I have been using these strings on my dreadnaughts/3/4 sized guitars for quite awhile now and they give a pretty good useful life and get to the point where they will hold a tune faster than some strings I've used in the past. They will not project as much as a normal gauge string, but there are things like microphones and pickups if you need more volume, and they are not as hard to get bar chords near the nut. Normally I play along with harps, whistles, bouzoukis, violins, cellos with a bodhran and these hold their own really well unplugged.",music

942,142,6288,"I looked at other cases and had several on my shortlist based on price, features and reviews. Right smack dab in the middle of moving I needed to upgrade the case for my Les Paul Standard Plustop PRO from my current gig bag. I knew when I got the gig bag it is what it is - a cheap, kinda-sorta-maybe protected carrying solution. This case is the real deal.

It should not be a surprise that it fits like a glove, which is what I expected from a case made by the guitar manufacturer. This should not be understated- this will fit your Epi Les Paul like it is nobody's business. The lining is fairly lush and well-padded and the hinge top storage section is of ample size and construction.

The clasps function well and open and closes with ease. While in the closed position, your gear is safely stowed and will survive transport without breaking a sweat.

The covering is quite good for a ~$100 guitar case and the handle placement balances well when being carried. (I have heard some mention they are not crazy with the case sporting a huge Epiphone logo, but I personally think that is ridiculous. For me, if you are that brand obsessed, then go fork out the cash for a Gibson, but as for me, I don't mind ""representing"" Epiphone as I really love this guitar. Get over yourself.)

Great bang for the buck and your Les Paul deserves this case. It would do the same for you.",music

I've had my guitar for over 6 months and played out with several times. It sounds great and I'm actually surprised at how many compliments I receive on it.

I used it and enjoyed it fully, but always wanted to go further than this puppy would take me.  Still, i want to mention that i did enjoy playing with this small keyboard quite a bit, and was tempted to buy the Rackmount version (MS2000) to see if it would be a deeper machine.

956,156,4809,"These extra-lights are what I use on my Backpacker...indeed, I really cannot use heavier strings.

And while the Backpacker, frankly, does not deliver a whole lot of full or complex tonality, I have to say the Martin strings really make it sound about as good as it can sound.  1st E doesn't sound at all brash or tinny, as can often be the case with other extra-lights I've tried on this axe.  And the 6th E does deliver a decently rich tone.

So main takeaway is these strings will help mitigate a less-than-ideal guitar.  It makes my Backpacker fun to play.  I like them a lot.",music

958,158,9320,"These strings have a lower tension than conventional strings of the same gauge, which means that it takes much less finger pressure to fret them, making the guitar quite a bit easier to play. The strings also cut into your fingers less. If you have a delicate vintage guitar that you still want to play, these strings may be just the ticket to go easy on the neck and bridge.

Their being easy to play makes them an especially good choice for beginners who may not have the finger strength yet and would like to avoid some frustration, players whose music involves a lot of barre chords which can be challenging, or really anyone who appreciates things being a bit easier. I think they're intended more for fingerstyle players than those using a pick since the strings get a little weird when played hard, but a pick would be okay with some styles of music, especially if you use a thin one -- you won't hurt the strings if you use a pick, but it may not respond the way you want.

I don't notice a large difference in tone between these strings and Martin's phosphor-bronze strings. In fact, I might not be able to tell the difference in a blind listening test. That means there isn't a huge disadvantage in sound in using these strings. Other than that I won't comment a lot on sound -- string tone is something that depends a lot on the guitar itself and your personal preference, and it's best to try out a set rather than ask someone with a different instrument and different ears whether they sound ""bright"" or ""warm"" or whatnot.

There are a couple big differences from conventional strings, though. One is that they play quieter. Another is that they don't like to be played very hard -- if you do so, the bass strings sort of flap around as they vibrate and you'll get a lot of buzzing against the frets.

Another thing I've noticed is the strings feel extremely light to play and are very flexible. That makes them easy to bend, but maybe too easy -- they're sensitive to having notes go sharp if you press too hard when fretting a note, and if you're fingering a difficult chord, they'll be more inclined to stretch if your finger is pressing at an angle, bending notes out of tune. This isn't a large problem, but it will take a little practice for you to clean up your technique as you get used to them.",music

I had tried everything to coax an exciting sound out of that big old box, but these picks finally did it. They were a total revelation: bright, crisp, clean, upfront sound. Easy to hold, fast and slick, they feel good against the strings and boy, do they sing. I use the 73's for flatpicking or digging into blues, and the 60's are great for smoother rhythm playing. Sometimes in a pinch I'll even use a 1.0 on the mandolin, although it's not my first pick, so to speak. Contrary to other reviews citing indestructibility, I have found they do create dust from being shaved against the strings, which is a little strange and a just a tad messy, but it's more than worth it for the sound. My only gripe at this writing: how come the 60's run a buck-fifty more per six pack than the 73's do?  Oh, the injustice.",music

989,189,6628,"Seems like I'm a minority but this is not for me. I like how these feel when they work, and they do when new, but when they fail it can get ugly.
In my band I have to play acoustic guitar to compete in volume with banjo (which I cannot but I try anyway), so I tend to play hard. I typically use medium gauge strings.
The problem is that sometimes they chip when strummed hard, and the edge becomes jagged. I'm not talking about normal wear, i.e. strings abrading/scraping pick materials away slowly and gradualy. In the case of ultex, even though the normal wear is much slower than delrin and celluloid, suddenly some tiny chunk of material flies away and that's it. Once this happens the edge catches the strings and I cannot play solo any more, so I need to swap the pick in the next song to continue playing. I keep the pick anyway and sand the jagged edge later.
To give this thing some credit, I've never had a chipping problem when I play electrics with 10-42 set. I can imagine that this is a perfect pick for some players.",music

992,192,6505,"This pedal has been around for a long time, and though the overall quality has declined as Boss has cut corners to enable lower priced mass production of their pedals, the boss ds-1 remains the staple image of distortion stompbox's. The ds-1 is a no-frills tank of a pedal; it was designed to withstand a direct nuclear blast as well as Michael Moore stepping on it, so you know it can take any amount of punishment you might care to give it.
  This pedal doesn't replicate any type of amplifier-it's not a ""Marshall-in-a-box, or a mesa boogie, or a vox, or a Fender; from a tonal aspect it isn't complex or dynamic. It will add plenty of grind to your tone, and plenty of hum to go with it. If you're looking for your first distortion pedal to use with your 15-watt practice amp, look no further. If you have a decent tube amp, look elsewhere, because with this pedal, you get what you pay for, and it simply will not do a quality amp justice.
  Pros: Inexpensive, good build quality, distorts your signal.
Cons: Lots of hum, the tone control gets really shrill really fast.
