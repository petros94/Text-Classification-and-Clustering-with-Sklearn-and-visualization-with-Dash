I'm writing this nearly four years later.\n\nAs with any stringed instrument, the strings really needed to stretch out before they would stay in tune. So, for the first several days, it was play a few minutes, tune, play a few minutes, tune. Then it was tuning daily. After a few weeks of this, the uke held a tune great. A tuner is not included in the package, which is the bulk of the minus star because a real beginner wouldn't have a way to tune the thing. (You need either a tuner or a reference note, say, on a piano or keyboard.) You can download a decent tuner app, though, for a buck or so. Do it, because you're going to need it a lot for the first couple of weeks.\n\nThe \"Firebrand\" ukulele is a laminated instrument of unknown wood. It's kind of dead-sounding. But then, soprano ukes generally sound a bit flattish to me - it's part of their distinctive character. The finish, while smooth, is spotty, and the decal around the sound hole has bubbles. But the fretboard is just barely adequately finished, with frets that are nicely flush with the edge of the neck so the feel is smooth - and has stayed smooth despite temperature changes. The beveled fret edges are filed, but not especially polished; even so, there's nothing to snag or catch. Fret dots are inset (one quite deeply) into the fingerboard and also painted on the upper edge of the neck, a nice touch. The action on mine is okay, at least down near the headstock where the starter chords live. The tuners are a triumph of cost-engineering: stamped metal with solid gears, so they're a definite step up from simple peg tuners. They make fine adjustments quite smoothly, and hold well over time. The bridge is slotted, so when you re-string you don't have to mess with that weird knot, just knot the end.\n\nI visited a specialty ukulele shop yesterday thinking of upgrading, and played with budget beginner soprano ukes costing three times what I paid for this whole set, and to me they played about the same and most even sounded the same; a few were a bit louder. They were all, however, finished to a much higher standard. I left empty-handed, but will probably get a better uke sometime soon. They're fun!\n\nThe bag is lightly made, unpadded, and has a fixed-length strap for carrying. It offered no advantage over just grabbing the uke to carry it, while adding the considerable disadvantage of needing to unpack it to play. It promptly went into the giveaway pile.\n\nWe haven't watched the DVDs, because the book has been great. It starts with C7 and F, and then adds C and G7, then G and D7. So it's not the C Am F G combo very common on YouTube. The songs are American folk traditionals, so if you've been around a campfire where any singing was involved, you've probably heard them before. There are lots of good instructions available online, including videos, so, really, the book is just a kick-starter to get you going. It's a pretty good book, with a reference section at the back with more chord diagrams than you're likely to need.\n\nIn all, it's an acceptable inexpensive starter set, not worth the \"list price\" but an OK value at Amazon's discounted price and a bargain at the Gold Box\/Lightning Deal price.\n\nUPDATE: I changed the strings to the Aquila Nylgut AQ-4 set. Yeah, they're $10 strings on a $15 instrument, but the improvement in sound is just huge. I also polished the frets and fingerboard with a \"magic eraser\"-like product (an ultra-fine abrasive), shined up the body, and filed down the plastic saddle (which simply pops out of the bridge) to lower the action. It plays and sounds much better now, although the intonation remains sharp on several notes if you go note-for-note up the frets.\n\nUPDATE #2: OK, after going through the book I binge-watched the DVD. It consists of two segments of about 33 minutes each, each segment subdivided into easy-to-locate chapters that follow the pages of the book. It's really very good! The \"instructor\" (and remember, I bought this four years ago so this may have changed) was musician Julia Jordan. Production values were good, and the multi-angle views of playing were helpful, as were all the play-along segments. Minor quibbles: Jordan played a larger ukulele than the one in the pack, so you can't hold it in the exact same way. And it seemed like the songs were keyed to a higher register than her natural speaking\/singing voice (you can hear her singing her own songs on a special feature and she's very pleasant to listen to).\n\nUPDATE #3: I now own a couple better ukuleles, have been a member of a ukulele meetup, and play a little almost every day. I can tell the difference between any of my better ukes and this one by both feel and ear. Still, it's a totally useable instrument, and it got me started on an enjoyable little musical hobby. Just remember to download a tuner app and maybe a metronome app and you're good to go.","summary":"A bargain-bin good-enough ukulele that's held up for years now and is still fun to play.","unixReviewTime":1460246400,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

It's light and the finish isn't beautiful, but it doesn't look like a toy, either. The matte finish does attract fingerprints and is very plain. I bought some rub on transfers to personalize and decorate, which made me happier.  The strings do have to be tuned frequently, but I expected that from the reviews. After three weeks of daily playing they tune easier and stay tuned longer but still need tuning before each session. I bought  the Hola! Electronic tuner and just leave it clipped on. Works beautifully.  I think the sound is pretty and it seems reasonably well made for the price. I'm sure I will trade up in a year or two, but this is a great starter.\n\nI would recommend this for anyone wanting to give ukulele a whirl.

I never played a ukelele before but I learned to play guitar many years ago.  I have no idea on how to tune a ukelele so I downloaded an app called \"Easy Ukelele\" available in Amazon and Google Playstore for free.  That is the only ukelele tuner I can recommend for beginners as it actually listens to your Ukelele and tells you when your device is in tune. I purchase this as gift to my son's 5th birthday that is coming up in 2 weeks so I have not yet preview the DVD and CD that came with it. I did however, checked and played with the ukelele while my son is at school, sleeping or playing outside to make sure that it is properly working when he open the box on his birthday and before the return period runs out.\n\nMy Review:\n\n1. The Package: The box comes with the Ukelele, Beginners Manual, DVD, CD, carry pack, and 2 extra set of Ukelele strings. Tuner is not included so I advise that you either buy a tuner or download the \"Easy Ukelele\" app I mentioned above.\n\n2. The Ukelele:  The Ukelele looks and feels decent. It has a sticker that says made in china. It comes pre-strung but it is out of tune.  I tuned it using the app I downloaded but it would not hold a tune. It is very bad that the sting gets out of tune before you even finish tuning all the other strings.  Basically, the ukelele sounded like an out of tuned toy when you first take it out of the box and even after a few adjustments.  Since the string is nylon, I gave it a chance to settle. I would tune it really sharp and leave it alone for at least 10 minutes or more then pick it up and strum on it and push the string from side to side.  I actually position the tuner pegs horizontally so I can see if it is moving when the string gets more tension. The tuner pegs stays in place so I know that the problem is with the string.  It could be that the string included is a cheap one.  After doing this a few time on day 1, I was able to play my first song I grabbed from the book (Clementine).  But after 1 song, you have to tune it again.  I just repeat what I did for the next 2 days, tuning it sharp and leaving it alone and play songs. Yesterday morning I tuned it sharp before leaving to work and when I came back in the afternoon, I checked the strings and they are still tuned to the same key I left them in the morning. I played with it for at least 10 minutes just trying to learn the music from the book and I was able to play at least 4 songs without any problem.  This morning, I checked the note again and they stay close to the G-C-E-A range. I could see this improving more as the ukelele gets used more. Even if I have to tune it every day  I would not have any problem with it.\n\nSo, for the reviews complaining about the device being out of tuned, just give the string a try to settle. This are cheap string that they included here and it will take time to settle in. Or you can buy a better quality string that costs around $9.00 for a set.  Another place you can check is the tuner, make sure that it does not get pulled back when the strings tension. If it would not hold its place then just grab a philips screw driver and tighten it a little.  That is an easy fix.\n\n2. The String: As I mentioned above, it is a cheap string that needs a lot of adjusting until it settles. Even if you buy a  good quality strings, I am sure that it will also need a few adjustment in the beginning. It comes with 2 extra set in case you accidentally snap the one that is already installed. The problem is that the extra set does not have a label so you have to eyeball it.  From some research I found online they said that the Thinnest string will be the A string. The second thinnest is the E string, The thickest is the C string and the second thickest is the G string. The extra string package says \"Gangia Brand\" on it so I assumed that that is the brand of the string.\n\n3. The Book: I just scanned the book and I could tell that it is written well for beginners. The songs included progress from only needing 2 chords in the beginning and they add more chords on the succeeding lessons. Each song have a chart on which chord you will use.\n\n4. The Case:  The case will protect your ukelele from dust, water and from getting dirty while you are transporting it but will definitely protect the device from being damage in case of a drop.\n\n5. The DVD's and CD's: I have not tried the DVD and CD's yet but the DVD's I believe will have the lesson and the CD will have the songs on the books so you can listen to it and have an idea on how to play the songs on the book. I will come back and edit this item once I get the chance to watch the DVD and listen to the CD.\n\nOverall. This is a great price for the package.","summary":"Great Package.

Rather than just giftwrapping the box, I took the uke out, tuned it, retuned it, stretched the strings, retuned it.  After 2 days, it would hold tune for about 3 minutes of playing (junk strings are probably to blame).  I did all this because my neice would be a beginner and therefore be easily frustrated by an instrument that would not hold tune.  Next I went to a \"learn to play\" site on the net and found C Am F G7 chord diagrams and started to attempt to play.  The strings were so high off the fretboard that any note fingered above the 3rd fret would pull the string out of tune.  The easy chords were difficult because the high strings got in the way of my fingers so that I could not finger a chord cleanly.\n\nWith the intonation and tuning problems, I was not willing to give this instrument to my neice, so next I went to a local music store to see if a set of strings and some shaving of the saddle (the white peice on the bridge that the strings rest on) would make it playable.  In order to gain a frame of reference, I picked up a $78 uke and strummed my newly learned chords.  It sounded and played great!  I told the music store guy that I wanted this uke to play like the $78 one.  He said the the cost would equal the original cost and still might not produce a good instrument.  Then he showed me a $40 instrument, an entry level uke from  Kala or Lanakai.  It played like the more expensive one, but didn't have the pretty binding, etc.  I loved it and bought it.  When I got home I called for an RMA and will send the much inferior Firebrand uke with all the books and cd's back to the seller.

A Firebrand wood soprano ukulele with nylon strings. (More on this)\n2. A copy of Alfred's Teach Yourself to Play Ukulele with a CD\n3. Extra strings\n4.

Many \"pro\" ukulele players and those who are advanced and own instruments that cost into the thousands, own a Dolphin and play it with pleasure. It comes in a myriad of colors, so if you are looking for something battle-solid, funky and kid-friendly, the Dolphin with Aquila strings has it all.\n\nIf you want to save money, this still is a good deal, but I suggest you change the strings to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Aquila-Strings\/dp\/B003NJF1G8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Aquila Strings<\/a>&nbsp;no matter what spare strings come with it. This is a soprano, by the way, so when buying strings, that's the size to look for. Aquilas are made of a nylon that makes a loud, rich sound and they are known for bringing out the sound of even poorer quality instruments. And you need a tuner--the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Snark-Tuner\/dp\/B003VWKPHC\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Snark Tuner<\/a>is not expensive and can be used on other types of instruments as well (guitar, etc.)\n\nThis was a good deal at under thirty simoleons, but if you are really serious to learn uke or want your kids to learn, the setup I mentioned may keep them interested longer. The quality of strings and the quality of a cheap uke can be optimized to the point where it's more than barely playable, and one mistake people make when taking up a musical instrument is to buy one that is so inexpensive, that it frustrates the learner. I have had this happen with the flute and the guitar. It really makes a difference what you learn on, and you have to balance the desire not to invest too much at first with the fact that too cheap a setup will just lead to failure.\n\nFor the record, I own a red Dolphin. I played uke as a kid and was able to pick up the instrument after 50 years of not playing, learn fingerstyle (picking) and enjoy playing it until I got a more serious instrument that indeed plays more sweetly. But I actually play the Dolphin quite a lot and enjoy its sound.\n\nThe setup I propose here will do you better as an adult, and will suit a child as well. You'll spend about twice as much but your chances for success are, in my opinion, a lot better. There are some excellent sites to visit to get free advice and to subscribe to video lessons (ukulele underground is my favorite.) Check out what I say and see if others don't agree with me. At the very least, if you opt for this package, get the better strings and the tuner. I guarantee you will be happier.","summary":"Not bad, but you could do better--here's how","unixReviewTime":1335657600,"vote":530.0,"style":null,"image":null}

Actually I was curious as to IF it would actually work, and this is what I've found thus far - Once you get the Chord Buddy installed on your guitar properly it works like a charm. I installed mine on a Squier Strat and found it was very easy to adjust properly. Within a minute or so I was playing chords easily and could work on my timing & strumming. Shortly thereafter I was playing LaBamba. I believe that it is important to make sure you install it absolutely in the proper position. I did find that it fits my Squier Strat better than the acoustic I also tried it on (although it does fit the acoustic, just not quite as well - a bit of string buzz, but still playable).\nI can't speak as to whether the Chord Buddy will actually help with finger dexterity (it very well could) or help actually learning to play the chords (it might) since I've had it less than a week, but it certainly helps me work on timing & strumming as I mentioned above.\nI do believe the Chord Buddy will be an excellent tool to get my daughter more interested in playing the guitar and that is definitely a good thing. I think it's a great idea and time will tell how well it helps with finger dexterity. But for now I give it 4 Stars as it is easy to use and actually quite fun.","summary":"Works Great Once Installed Properly","unixReviewTime":1420934400,"vote":3.0,"style":{"Format:":" Electronics"},"image":null}

There seems to be a lot of good reviews, so good for them.  And it is a great premise, the books\/DVD are very well done.  Where it falls short for me is in the actual device.  The plastic 'fingers' tend to drift a bit (they are removable), and they hit each other and mess things up.  But the major flaw is how it attaches to the guitar.  It clamps to the neck on the sides, however, the Chord Buddy needs to stay above the strings (so as to not hit the wrong notes), so it also needs something to hold the top solidly.  But any pressure on the buttons causes it to 'fall' down a bit, making contact with the wrong strings.  I'm going to try to clamp it so this doesn't happen, but with the finger drift, I'm not sure this will work anyway.  One wonders what would have happened if they had used better materials?\n\nUpdate:  figured I'd post this, maybe it will help others.  I had to file some edges of the fingers that were rubbing against each other.  Then, in order to stop them from 'drifting' back into each other, I had to glue them (fingers not removable anymore!).  No biggie for me, as I don't see doing half Chord Buddy, half fingering anyway.  The biggest fix came in keeping the Chord Buddy from tilting down.  I took a rubber band and looped it over the rounded plastic (by the tightening screw), underneath the neck and hooked to the other side.  This gives it enough tension so as to not continually flop down.\n\nWhile it now works, I can't give a better grade.  For this much money, it should work well out of the box.\n\nSecond Update:  I also picked up a copy of Rocksmith.  I would have to say that Chord Buddy makes you feel like you are playing a song (strumming a few chords is all it is really doing).  Rocksmith lets you play single notes and then graduate to more, while also making you feel like you are playing along.  I would have to recommend Rocksmith over Chord Buddy, and it's cheaper to boot!","summary":"Great idea, implementation not so hot","unixReviewTime":1355702400,"vote":13.0,"style":null,"image":null}

I had no problem attaching it to the neck of the guitar - the instructions were a little confusing at first, but once I played with it a bit,  I was able to figure it out.  I will say it is fun to be able to play chords at the start and helps familiarize the absolute beginner (me) with how the chords work.  I can't yet speak to how well the device helps you progress with learning the chords - it is a novel concept: you gradually remove the \"keys\" and finger the chords yourself, ultimately removing the device entirely once you've mastered the chords. I agree that it takes a bit of the frustration of learning, because you are playing chords right away, and I think that helps make learning fun.\nReally, my only complaint is that it's a bit expensive. The jury is still out as to whether it's worth the price or not.","summary":"Kinda like Guitar Hero for your instrument","unixReviewTime":1343088000,"vote":5.0,"style":null,"image":null}

I am a solo performer, playing a variety of styles from acoustic singer-songwriter stuff to loop-driven electro-rock. I typically play bars and have probably used these for nearly 100 gigs at this point.\n\n3 K10s along with an&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Allen-Heath-ZED-10FX-Four-Mono-Mic-Lines-with-2-Active-D-I-3-Stereo-Line-Inputs-and-Onboard-Effects\/dp\/B003T77ZJU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Allen & Heath ZED-10FX Four Mono Mic\/Lines with 2 Active D.I., 3 Stereo Line Inputs and Onboard Effects<\/a>&nbsp;mixer make up my whole system, using two as mains and one as a monitor. My previous system was a powered Mackie box and passive 12\" speakers by Community and Yamaha.\n\nI have thus far been thrilled with the significant sound improvement I have experienced. The volume and clarity that these 10\" speakers produce is truly impressive. To give you an idea, I generally play rooms that are one to two thousand square feet in size and rarely turn my mains up much past 50%. At 60-75% levels (with mixer meters peaking around the zero mark) the music will cut through even the rowdiest bar noise.\n\nOne thing that's great about this 10\" model is the throw. With a super-wide 90 degree dispersion angle, sound fills out the space up close within a few feet, depending on placement (I prefer getting them up as high as possible on stands and using the clever 7.5 degree tilt function). The dispersion angle is also matched between the woofer and tweeter so you're never hearing just one or the other. 90 degrees is ideal for tight performance areas where you want people right in front of you to hear everything.\n\nThe trade-off here is that levels decrease quickly as you step back from the speakers. You can hear a significant difference as you get more than twenty or thirty feet away. While that could be seen as a negative especially for public address applications, I find it to be a win-win.  It essentially creates a \"full sound\" zone around the stage for the audience. I personally prefer creating a live music environment where people can hear a loud, full spectrum mix if they like but not have it forced on them wherever they are in the room. If your needs call for a speaker with more reach, the K12s (I've used them) throw a lot further and sound awesome as well.\n\nSpeaking of sound quality, I will say that while I think the K10 kicks the competition's a** throughout the EQ, it is especially spectacular in the mids and highs. Just playing an iPod through them, you will hear separated parts of the music in this range that you never did before. As far as your perfomances go, vocals and guitars will sparkle in a way you probably haven't heard out of a small cabinet.\n\nI don't want to downplay the bass response on these though. It is huge and far more than you would expect out of these little guys. The frequency coverage is absolutely there and can even be boosted if you utilize the DEEP switch. What you will NOT hear in the lower registers however is a ton of attack. They are more suited to adequately express a jazzy upright bass than they are to throw down the punch you want to hear from electronica or hip-hop (unless we're talking smaller spaces, they'll ROCK a house party DJs). Impressive but you'll find no magic here, that's why they make the Ksub.\n\nProspective buyers should also know that the 1 KW amp in these is Class D. That's not equivalent to 1000 watts in Class A for example. It's more than sufficient though and Class D amps are great for their light weight and power efficiency. I plug mine into a surge protector that powers a bunch of other devices simultaneously and have never had an issue.\n\nSignal routing is wildly flexible with the fantastic panel on the back. You can do whatever you want with these including play a small gig with one speaker alone. Just plug a mic, an instrument, and an iPod directly in.\n\nErgonomics are well done too. Knobs and switches are not fancy but easy to operate. There's also super sturdy, comfy handles on the top and on one side. Carrying two at once is easy (32 lbs. each) and saves you a trip back to the car.\n\nThe build quality is solid. I've always been careful with them but not used cases or bags and the only damage thus far has been cosmetic. The sides will scuff up pretty easily so use the duffels if thats important to you.\n\nI have not observed any malfunction up to this point other than some buzzing from the monitor once when it got rained on. After drying out, it didn't happen again. QSC has also put some serious limiting circuitry into these as well to protect themselves from blowing. I have more than once pushed my monitor too hard and reached this threshold. The signal simply cuts out when the the speaker cone experiences too much travel. Once you readjust the levels, you're back in business with no issue.\n\nI can't think of much to gripe about, the whole K series was very well thought out. I would love to incorporate a Ksub at some point as the crossover function is built into the entire line. These speakers aren't cheap at $700 a piece but you'll be paying for quality and design that cannot be found elsewhere.","summary":"QSC K10- Best In Class","unixReviewTime":1318896000,"vote":29.0,"style":null,"image":null}

For the extra 15 bucks, the Sony MS907 is easily worth the upgrade.  The only advantage of the DS70 is not having to worry about having a fresh battery installed.  The MS907 sounds fuller and richer, but frankly I did not judge it to be superior to the overall effect of the 4-point microphone that comes with the popular Zoom H-2.  Whether or not you choose to use it in place of the onboard mic of a high-end personal audio recorder really comes down to a matter of personal taste.  On the other hand, if you've picked up the new Zoom H-4n, this Sony stereo mic would be an excellent choice for complementing the onboard ones since the new Zoom allows for use of onboard and external mics simultaneously.\n\nAs for recording to a software audio program on an iMac, that particular computer has an audio input that will accommodate the 3.5mm plug (but be aware that many computers do not have such an input--in that case, look at a USB mic such as those from Blue).  Even with the right fit and a fresh battery, I found the MS907 to be somewhat underpowered for optimal results.  It wasn't until I plugged it into an Onkyo preamp that I was satisfied.  Again, I suspect that a mic with a USB connector would permit better gain levels with most computers.\n\nThere are adequate mic amps on Amazon for $20-$40, capable of boosting your signal by 48 volts, or 60 dbs. A Mac user willing to spend a bit more should look at the MXL Signal Booster Amp for Mac Computers, which costs a bit more but saves you the bother of USB conversion. Finally, if you're trying to make professional announcements for radio use, etc., you'll soon discover that, unless you're incapable of puckering (which means you're not much of a kisser), the plosives (\"p\" sounds) will run away with everything you try to say. The only solutions I've found are to write scripts that are devoid of plosives (the \"voiced\" \"b\" phoneme is almost as much of an offender as the voiceless \"p\" phoneme) or to pick up a \"pop filter.\" The latter are little more than 6\" circles of cheese cloth costing $20-$30 each, but I'm about to give in and order one from Amazon.\n\nThe last advice I'll offer is not to indulge in candy or a sweet soda while broadcasting. It'll thicken your saliva and make you sound like someone attempting to communicate with his dentist after being shot up with novocaine (or is it lidocaine, these days?)--in any case, it's sugar cane, and fuctose syrup, that will muck up your elocution, making your gums talk louder than your words.","summary":"Useful mic priced lower than ever, but here are a few tips.","unixReviewTime":1244332800,"vote":4.0,"style":null,"image":null}

First, it's nearly indestructible (and trust me, between me, the kids, and various pets we have tried to destroy this).  Secondly, you can indeed get very nice music out of it.  Not talking \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" music but decent tunes with trills, etc. -  the experience of the player is what matters.  Third,  I like not having to mess around with the \"playing in\" requirements of nicer wooden instruments.  I can throw this recorder in a basket for weeks on end and then play it for as long as I want to play it without having to worry about it being humidified properly.  HOWEVER, the tuning of this instrument is frankly a little bit luck of the draw.  My recorder runs flat at the higher register (starting with high C and getting flatter as it goes). My daughter's Yamaha runs sharp in about the same area.  The tuning issue honestly isn't very noticeable if we're playing by ourselves, but is pretty awful sounding when we play together.  Now if you're really into ensemble work, you buy a nice wooden instrument and make sure the shop checks and fixes the tuning before you take it home. This is a mass produced recorder and - if you're buying it online - you get what you get. That said, it really is decent for the price and once you (or your kid) gets the hang of it, you can blow a little harder or softer to correct the majority of manufacturer imprecisions.\n\nETA:  Note that this recorder is the *Baroque* version, which is what my kid uses in school.  This means that the low F is split fingered (fingers down on left plus 1&3 on right... and yep, two fingers is good enough to sound in tune and easier to learn for beginners)","summary":"Good instrument at cheap price, but tuning is luck-of-the draw","unixReviewTime":1465257600,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

It was one I bought used from a friend's guitar teacher. I loved that guitar. Never did I have a single complaint about it. And I had it with me everywhere I went until I was almost 40 years old.\n\nMy son was an avid electric guitar player who wanted to give acoustic a try. Since I didn't have time to play my guitar during that time of my life I LENT my guitar to him. When I eventually had more free time and wanted to get back into my music I asked my son to please return my guitar, the one I let him BORROW. It was at that time he informed me that he SOLD it to a buddy when he needed money buy a Fender bass. Kids...\n\nSo...I bought this one and am very happy to have a Yamaha Classical Guitar back in my possession. The only differences I can see between my old one and this one are the colors and design around the sound hole and the absence of Yamaha on the headstock. To be sure this was the brand of classical guitar I wanted, I tried several different brands and models available on Amazon.com at local guitar stores.\n\nEvery other brand of classical guitar, regardless of the price, did not hold up to the sound of the Yamaha guitars. I'm not saying the other brands did not sound good. What I'm saying is the Yamahas sounded great. Should I ever decide to upgrade to a better classical guitar, I will stay with Yamaha.\n\nI could not find a lower price for this model than the Amazon.com price...anywhere. Having the Free Shipping option was a major plus.\n\nThere is only one reason I needed to call the Yamaha Customer Support Line. I needed to ask where the serial number is located. I couldn't find it to save my life. On the C40, look inside the sound hole to the inside edge of the fretboard.\n\nMy guitar was wrapped very well for shipping. It came with \"The Yamaha Guitar Quickstart DVD.\" The DVD has some very useful information to help you get started if you have no idea what to do with your guitar once you take it out of the box. A \"Welcome\" sheet with some good basics for beginners was also included.\n\nIt is so good to have another Yamaha Classsical Guitar back in my life.","summary":"Unbelievable quality at an unbelievable price","unixReviewTime":1143158400,"vote":106.0,"style":null,"image":null}

In the same way as all we, people, have the same hands, legs and heads but have different nature and voices, the guitars, even of the same model of the same manufacturer may differ wildly.\n\nThe Classical guitar has to be made of wood. And wood, even of the same age and tree has much of personality and much of \"specifics in sound.\n\nIf you consider this guitar you are shopping in the lowest end for cheap instrument. Well do not do it! Because I doubt you will learn it ever.\n\nFirst of all buy the real Spanish guitar. I mean Spanish made in Span not the \"Spanish\" made in China or anywhere else. Spanish guitars, even the cheapest made toward sound, not toward look. Do not buy guitar with laminated top, it will sound as a toilet sitting and you never will be able to get decent sound out of it. The quality of sound is very important while playing classical guitar and you produce the sound with your hands. It is crucially important to learn to produce right sound by positioning fingers and nails properly: you will never learn it with cheap, not authentic guitar, because it will sound the same whatever you will try! It is like a car that make only left turn. Then you will try to play the real guitar not the bogus one , you will find youself incapable to make it sound as other players do.\n\nDo not try to choose guitar yourself because you can't produce any reasonable judgment until you will learn how to make it sound properly, you must take someone who actually knows how to play classical guitar. You have to get  a decent instrument because you MUST fall in love with the sound of one, otherwise it is pointless: you play guitar because it fascinates you esthetically. I doubt that toilet sitting sound out of shipping box that pretends to produce music will fascinate you!\n\nOnce again, Spanish guitar improves with an age but not one with the laminated top. If you in budget, do not trash you money with cheap Chinese garbage but save more instead and by the real thing.\n\nHere we are, these are my recommendations for those who really seek to learn to play classical\/Spanish guitar:\n\n1. Do not buy guitar online, buy it in the local Guitar Center for example! Listen to the actual instrument. If you like the sound take it!\n\n2. Do not buy guitar with laminated top, they are guitar only by appearance.\n\n3.

They barely outlasted the warranty. We proposed plopping down nearly 4 C-notes on a dozen 20-foot Standard 100 mike cables to our church's finance council.  The words \"Lifetime Warranty\" were the clincher.\n\nHum? Forget about it. Cell phone static? Thing o' the past. CB radio interference? Tunes it right out. The secret is twisted pair construction, which eats up an extra inch or so of wire per foot of finished cable. The signal becomes its own electronic shield against noise. Cheaper cables use a side-by-side or linear configuration.  It saves wire and keeps the price down but the cable acts as an antenna and attracts all kinds of electromagnetic junk from the air.\n\nThe jacket resists twisting and uncoils smoothly. It also rolls up for storage without fighting back like a snake that's had a few espresso shots.\n\nThe ends are finished with somewhat oversize connectors, providing a generous grip for smooth insertion and removal, but they can be a hindrance for performers who like a grab a mike off the stand and solo. That's not a problem in a church choir, so we expect the cables to last a long time. If you need a cable with a slimmer connector, move up to the Performer 500 or Studio Pro 1000 series.\n\nThe finishing touch in our sound setup is the Monster Cable S-100 instrument patch cord and an attenuating adapter for hooking our mixer to the sound system. Velvety-quiet signal transfer and audio quality that's good to the last note.\n\nWe have yet to use the Lifetime Warranty but the peace of mind is, well, as good as a gift from God.","summary":"The Monster goes to church","unixReviewTime":1189641600,"vote":6.0,"style":null,"image":null}

Vasser","reviewText":"Monster makes some decent quality cables and while no less reliable than other major manufacturers' cables they are more expensive than other brands.  Monster throws lots of techno-babble around about things like \"time correct windings\" but if the cable doesn't work it doesn't matter how good it is.  Their higher end products make more of a difference in sound quality than their entry level line.\n\nMonster makes three series of progressively more expensive microphone cables which are the 100 (this one), the 500 (BETTER) and 1000 (BEST.)  This \"100\" cable series is their \"entry level\" mic cable and their lightest weight XLR cable series with the smallest diameter cable.\n\nWhile the cable itself is small in diameter, the 100 series cable has big fat MOLDED-ON XLR connectors, the presence of which creates with two drawbacks.  First, if they break you can't fix them and you just have to cut them off and replace them.  Second, when you pull a Shure SM-57 or SM-58 size mic out of the stand adapter these fat molded connectors don't slide as smoothly through the stand adapter as a standard Switchcraft type connector would.\n\nWhen these connectors go bad, you could buy a new Switchcraft connector and solder it on which would void the warranty, but the cable is not user serviceable otherwise.  Since they have a \"LIFETIME\" warranty on all Monster products, instead of fixing it you can get it replaced free and I'm of the opinion that this warranty is why this cable costs about twice what it should. Plus you have to do without the cable for a while until you get the replacement.\n\nThere are a multitude of other manufacturers making good reliable mic cables and some have better material quality than the Monster 100. Aside from the Monster lifetime warranty you'd be just as well off with a quality cable from another quality line and in some cases better off.  Some of the other manufacturers also have a lifetime warranty.\n\nThe color coding was a nice idea, but from 30 feet away the tech won't be able to see the little colored insert stripe ring.  3-M Mystic tape is the time proven color coding material anyway.\n\nCables with these molded on type connectors would be more suitable for a permanent installation such as a church or meeting hall or infrequent use than for a band that plays a different room every night.  They are not as durable as one with standard Switchcraft or Neutrik XLR connectors.\n\nIf you must have a Monster mic cable and if you are going to be using the cable a lot, or using it in a critical situation I'd step up at least to the 500 series or try another reliable name brand like Planet Waves or the Horizon brand which are very well made.  I've also had good luck with the Shure brand cables which is a very economical solution.\n\nThere are also a number of small companies selling custom made Mogami or Canare mic cables.  Just do an internet search on Mogami mic cable.  In many recording studios you can usually find Mogami and\/or Canare brand cables.\n\nI do use the pricier Monster instrument cables which are worth at least some of the extra money to me.  I own two of those and they have been good cables.  These Series 100 Microphone cables are better than nothing, but no cable is 100% failsafe so I'd keep a spare handy.

I didn't return it and as stated I use it for the output on the pedal board. Save your money... I went back to my Planet Waves Cable...I payed $30.00 back in the eighties for the Planet Waves which now comes in at around $50.00. What I'm getting at is you get what you pay for.

I am not sure it (the higher priced model) is even more sturdy because the molded stress relief ends on this model seem to make it more reliable than its pricier sibling.\n\nBottom line: carefully compare both cables using your own instrument and amp - if possible - before making a purchase decision.

You have a bit of travel on the pedal before it actually registers (I have to go almost halfway down before I notice an effect), and the half-pedaling effect seems to go to a full pedal early (Don't hear much a difference between 3\/4ths and fully depressed pedal). If there was a way to adjust the sensitivity on this pedal, I would definitely give it 5 stars. It's well worth having one of these, especially if you have another pedal plugged in alongside it, though I would want to test one against the original Yamaha FC3.","summary":"Great, takes some getting used to.","unixReviewTime":1477872000,"vote":5.0,"style":{"Style:":" Sustain Pedal with Half-Pedaling"},"image":null}

I kept having problems finding it with my foot or having it move.  I found a piece of wood 9\"x16\"x3\/4\" (23 cm x 41 cm x 2 cm) and mounted the pedal to the board with double sided carpet tape.  (Glue would work too.)  I even put little rubber feet on the other side of the board.  This setup works perfectly.\n\nThe YPT-300 senses the position of the mode switch when it is first turned on to determine if switch closed or switch open means sustain.  This means it doesn't matter with the YPT300 that the switch will not be accessible when mounted to the board.  Check your keyboard to verify this function and if it doesn't make this check, be sure the pedal mode switch is in the right position before gluing!","summary":"works fine if mounted","unixReviewTime":1210982400,"vote":15.0,"style":null,"image":null}

For years I used seemingly indestructable guitar cables that were made for me by an electrician friend.  When they finally gave out, I got in the habit of using the no-name cables that are always on display near the register at Guitar Center- really more of an impulse buy than something I put any thought into.  After the third or fourth Guitar Center cable failed from light use I decided to try these cables.  Not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better.  I am not terribly hard on my gear but my cables tend to get twisted as I move around and the cheaper ones  eventually fail mid-cable.  I don't mind spending a few extra dollars if the cable is a little more durable.  This cable is actually cheaper- $12 or so shipped- and it's holding up pretty well.  These are actually very reasonably priced for 18' cables.  There is some kind of limited life warantee on this product but I haven't needed it.  Five stars for a nicely made 18 foot guitar cable that costs $12 shipped!\n\nIncidentally- these cables are shielded and are meant to connect your instrument to your amp's input.  Do not use these to connect an amplifier to a speaker cab.  You want to use unshielded cables for that purpose.\n\nEdit-  More than 6 months has passed and this cable is functioning without any issues.  The price on these things has gone up significantly and although the cable is highly recommended, there are probably better values from Hosa, Monster or Planet Waves-","summary":"So far so good.

That means you would need another short XLR mic cable to extend from the mic to this adapter.\n\nSo just be aware that this may work fine for some and not work at all for others.

The really, really cheap, thin, flimsy colored cables, or the Pro cables. Spend the extra few dollars and go the Pro route. It's still cheaper than the competition and you are getting a very comparable cable. The Hosa Premium midi cables have very thick, solid midi connectors that fit nicely into you midi ports and the cable will not easily come out inadvertantly.

Weaver","reviewText":"We have a Presonus StudioLive 16.4.2 mixer and a Panasonic TM700K HD camcorder we wanted to use to record our youth ministry services. Using different types of cables had caused significant buzz coming out of the board's AUX (line-level) outputs. We had the same problem with a Canon XA10 in another venue, but had used a DI box to convert the TRS 1\/4\" output to XLR while cutting the signal down to mic-level. However, the Panasonic doesn't have an XLR input, so we thought we would need this cable to go out of the DI box & into the camera. To our surprise, we could connect it to our mono output on the board (after cutting down the signal strength with a small knob next to it on the board) & run it directly to the camera without having issues. We don't have the flexibility of making a separate mix through one of the AUX outputs, but we also didn't have any AUX's to spare.\n\nIt's a long explanation, but hopefully it will help someone, whereas it took me many hours of searching online for an answer. i highly recommend this cable & will start using more HOSA's in the future!","summary":"Worked great from our mixer's mono output to camcorder mic input","unixReviewTime":1401667200,"vote":null,"style":{"Length:":" 15 Feet"},"image":null}

{"overall":4,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"05 16, 2012","reviewerID":"AQ3BVPWA301ZF","asin":"B000068NZG","reviewerName":"J. Foster","reviewText":"Let me start this by saying that the bad reviews need to be read from a very skeptical viewpoint.  It sounds like most of the bad reviews were written by people who had purchased this for a mic that needs a different type of cable, or who don't understand the wiring of this cable and it's intended function.  With only one exception, this cable is NOT designed for a stereo camera.  That exception being a stereo microphone that uses a male 3-pin XLR jack to output an unbalanced, stereo feed across pins 2 and 3 (with pin 1 being ground).  Excepting that very rare microphone type, this should not be used for a stereo camera.\n\nThis cable is a BALANCED cable.  It is designed for Balanced XLR microphones (pretty much any professional microphone) to connect to a camera or device that uses a BALANCED 1\/8\" TRS microphone input jack.  It is wired Pin 1 to Sleeve, Pin 2 to tip, and Pin 3 to Ring.  Again, it should not be used for anything with a stereo input on a 1\/8\" TRS jack.\n\nFor those people wanting to use a professional XLR microphone with a stereo camcorder, you need to search for a mono XLR to Stereo 1\/8\" TRS cable.  I have one, that I purchased from Amazon and it works very well for my stereo cameras.  This is not that cable.\n\nNow, that said, Here's my review... It does what it is supposed to do.  I don't really know what else to say.  I purchased this to use with my T2i running Magic lantern that allows the use of balanced mics on the external input.  When I run my T2i with the mic jack as a stereo input, I have to use my other adapter or my stereo microphone with it's own cable.  The wiring seems fine, though a little on the fragile side.  With normal home\/amateur use, this will work fine.  For professional use, you probably won't be using any cameras with an 1\/8\" jack anyway.  If it used a bit heavier cable and a Neutrik connector, I would give it 5 stars, but then it would cost a lot more.  For what it is, it's actually just fine.\n\nI guess my only real complaint is that it looks identical to my XLR to stereo 1\/8\" TRS cable, so I had to use a sharpie to mark this one as being balanced and mark my other one as being stereo.  Not a big deal, but something to keep in mind if you get multiple Hosa adapters.\n\nEdit to add:  here is the link to the stereo cable that most people should get...

This past year, I bought a Kirlin cable, this Hosa cable, a GLS Audio cable, and a Seismic Audio cable.  Of the bunch, the Kirlin is my favorite -- it's clear that the metal connector design and the strain reliefs are designed for heavy duty usage. The cable thickness is also the largest diameter of the 4 I bought, and the weave of the braid is tight. Overall, if I had to guess which cable was going to last the longest, I'd guess the Kirlin one. It will last forever used just my house; if I were to ever start gigging again, I'd guess it would last at least a few years of hard gigging, or quite a few years of light gigging. That said, this was also the second most expensive of the above cables -- by just a few dollars, sure, but if you absolutely know the cable won't be subject to much abuse, the Hosa or GLS Audio also seem great without compromising too much on quality.\n\nThis Hosa is my second favorite; it seems a bit more durable than the GLS Audio. The strain reliefs on this cable are not as beefy as on the Kirlin, but plenty good enough for indoor play. If you play out at all or do more than just sitting in the same chair every time you practice, I would consider the Kirlin. At the time I purchased, the Kirlin was actually a little cheaper than the Hosa, which made it a better value. The Hosa is lighter and more flexible than the Kirlin, though, which you might prefer for indoor play. If my Hosa is closer by, I definitely don't bother looking for the Kirlin -- in fact, the Hosa is the one that stays plugged in most of the time, just because that's how things happened to end up.\n\nThe Seismic Audio is the style I used to buy in high school -- definitely wouldn't rely on it for gigging, but it should be fine for most practice session use.\n\nI am playing through a small modeling amp (Fender Mustang I v2), and usually play with some light effects on -- so I'm not going through a sound system where you might really discern the difference between these inexpensive cables and a high end cable (I might be wrong about that, but wouldn't know since I've never owned a cable more than $25 before). I briefly considered a fancier cable, but honestly haven't felt like anything was missing given my current setup. If you are of a similar mindset, you won't miss out on anything with this Hosa cable.","summary":"Great cable","unixReviewTime":1474761600,"vote":null,"style":{"style:":" Straight to Right-Angle"},"image":null}

It is as quiet or quieter than any other cable I own, and at the price, this is a very good deal. My practice room has 12- 4' x 4 bulb fluorescent light fixtures- yes, that is 48 light total. They are the old kind with noisy ballasts. This cable just doesn't let that stuff in, though.

That would probably be my only knock and it isn't really a knock since it is appropriately sized for the length.\n\nThis is a pro cable (gauge question aside) at consumer pricing.

It appears to be well constructed: solid tweed cover (Which I much prefer to the old rubber coating), longer rubber reinforcement jacket near the plugs than the other low-end guitar cables I've had, and a Velcro tie to keep the cable together when wound up is a nice touch.

This cable looked like a steal at under $10. Especially since it had such great reviews.\nIve been using it for a couple of weeks and am very happy with it. Let me tell you why.\n\nThe rubber insulation on the cable is fairly soft and supple, making them nice and easy to stow away in a loop. The metal casings on the plugs are decent and can be unscrewed to open them making them serviceable should one of the wires somehow become disconnected.  Though you will have to remove the heat-shrink tubing which extends about three inches out of the casings. (You can see the white sheathing in the amazon photos). The only thing I might recommend that needs improvement is dropping the blue thread-lock on the threads inside the plugs because they tend to come loose over time. Otherwise, the cable is very good for the price.\n\nI recommend it.","summary":"Great--Especially for the Price","unixReviewTime":1437264000,"vote":null,"style":{"Size:":" 10 Feet"},"image":null}

Normally that wouldn't be a problem, but the release buttons are really tiny and pointy, and you have to press them crazy hard to pull them out of any panel mount connector.

It's quality outweighs its price. Let's face it, a cable is a cable is a cable. But the quality of these cables can vary greatly. I replaced a lighter cable with this one and I was surprised at the difference in the quality of the sound from my amp. I have an Ibanez ART series guitar into an Ibanez 15 watt amp set up in my home. With nothing changed but the cable, there was a significant difference in quality and volume. So much so that I checked with my guitar teacher who said he was not surprised. The quality appears good. The ends are heavy duty and the little bit of hum I had due to the proximity of everything was attenuated to the point where it was inconsequential. I've seen more expensive cables and this one is (so far) great.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Hosa-GTR210-Guitar-Cable-10-Ft\/dp\/B000068NW5\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hosa GTR210 Guitar Cable 10 Ft<\/a>","summary":"Good quality, great price","unixReviewTime":1320192000,"vote":null,"style":{"Size:":" 10 Feet"},"image":null}

They lasted about six years with very occasional use before both developed shorts in the cheap XLR connectors. It's really a problem with all Hosa XLR products in that the XLR connectors they use on everything are really cheap and have a poor design flaw where the cable moves too freely in the rubber boot without any real crimping of the cable by the plug. As a result, the wire will eventually break strand by strand at the pins of the connector as the cable works its way back and forth from use. Higher quality and higher price XLR connectors like the industry standard Neutrik XLR plugs have a different design and don't allow this to happen. Then again, you won't find a Neutrik Y adapter for the low price of these Hosa ones. They are cheap and they work for awhile but for as cheap as they are you can just buy new ones when the old ones develop a short which is exactly what I did.","summary":"Cheap enough to buy new ones when the old ones short","unixReviewTime":1457654400,"vote":3.0,"style":{"Size:":" 6 Inch"},"image":null}

I always say, half of video is audio. For years I used to run a line directly out of the DJ's mixer to get my audio. The issue with doing it that way is during introdustions you will get the music the dj is playing and the words they are speaking. Often though, the signal is to hot, the music is crap, or the dj says something stupid. With just the DJ's voice I can edit the way I want and compress time.

On top of that I have also done work as a mobile DJ and have used various microphones, so I do know what I am talking about when I say that, even for the price, there are better options on the market.\n\nInitially, I started using my own Shure PG48 (not the SM58) in place of one of the R21's that had been used for vocals, switching it over instead to amplify an acoustic guitar. The R21 did well when it came to amplifying acoustic instruments, so I was able to find a use for them, while using my entry-level Shure for vocals and just regular speaking, which that handled a lot better.\n\nThen, when I purchased a portable Behringer sound system, their XM1800S microphone came with it, so I was introduced to that. The XM1800S also comes in a three pack that's about $5 less, but it gets compared to the Shure SM58, with some professionals preferring it to the standard Shure microphone. So, I ordered the three pack of XM1800S, and am keeping the Samson R21's strictly as instrument microphones.\n\nI want to end this review by saying I don't hate the Samson R21 mics. They just weren't cutting it on vocals, but they have done well when it comes to instruments. As anything, it really depends on what you're using it for, but if you take my advice, use the R21 for instruments, use the Behringer XM1800S for vocals and save yourself $5.

They are also ideal if you are hosting jams and open mic nights and want reasonably reliable microphones that don't cost a fortune - but get the job done.\n\nWhat I love is the price and value. You get three instruments that may not be SM58s, but they are not terribly far off. And if you run them through an&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Alesis-Mic-Tube-Duo-Stereo-Tube-Microphone-Preamplifier\/dp\/B005NIVLX4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Alesis Mic Tube Duo Stereo Tube Microphone Preamplifier<\/a>&nbsp;I think you would be hard pressed to tell the difference in a blindfold test.\n\nOther factors that led me to give five stars include a protective case that comes with mic holders, attention to small details like the anti-dent ring on the windscreen, and low handling noise. In other words, they are inexpensive, but not cheap.\n\nYou can also use these to mic amps. Placing these 6\" from speakers (or bass drums or toms) captures a lot of low end.

In that case, I simply had to remind the key speaker to repeat the question and then answer it.  There were some big advantages over the 20' wired lapel mike I used - mostly the absence of the cable.  There there was little difference in audio quality.  I also did a brief test recording audio in separate rooms, with a closed door - and while my test was far from complete, the audio was still good.

Mesa","reviewText":"This particular Audio Technica cartridge will suprisingly enough yield very crisp and clear audio quality. Bass response is tight but not overwhelming nor weak. The wonderful thing about this type of cartridge is that it's basically a plug and play set up (just have to tighten a screw to hold it in place with most P-mount systems). The elliptical stylus or tip is designed for better contact with the stereo groove walls in a record resulting in better frequency response and clarity. The user does not have to worry about how much stylus pressure,weight, or anti-skating to provide to get the most from this cartridge;that's the beauty of using this cartridge on a P-mount tonearm instead of as a standard one...This cartrdige will perform admirably when used for regular record listening conditions. This is not a DJ stylus to scratch with as you may damage the needle and the record (\"burn\"). Also, it is more suitable for playing any kind of music except classical or jazz where a high end audiophile cartridge\/needle would be needed. Such a high end cartridge and needle would bring out extreme musical detail as well as the ambiance or \"air\" of the instruments. Also, that would allow for better stereo separation as well... This is only a better than average cartridge meaning that you will only get about maybe a little over a year's worth of use from it (if you played one or 2 records a day or every 2 days respectively). That is also the difference between a basic low priced cartridge\/stylus versus an audiophile grade one (those can usually go for about 5 years---but you would be talking anywhere from hundreds to maybe thousands of dollars).","summary":"A Solidly Good Cartridge","unixReviewTime":1067299200,"vote":55.0,"style":{"Style:":" AT92ECD Phonograph Cartridge"},"image":null}

Looked for something decent that didn't cost too much. Was preparing to spend about 50.00 until I ran across this one. Hooked it up and gave it a whirl and was very, very surprised at how good it sounds. It is right there on top. Better than the Signet it replaces and even better than the Stanton 881S. The latter of which has aged some 40 years so that may not be a fair comparison. The Stanton was state of the art for it's day and still sounds decent but figured, I don't spin the vinyl a lot so a decent cartridge would be more than adequate. Audio Technica has always made decent products. Their Mics and other equipment is reliable as it gets. You won't spend a lot of money but you will get a good product. Now, this cartridge is a bargain but sounds as good as some of the top selling ones selling for many times  the price. That's a huge bonus. With Amazon's great return policy, I figured it was worth a try and if it sounded awful, I could return it. Won't need to do that. It's a great find. I would not hesitate to get it again.\n\nPros: Great sound, all the hardware for both mounts are included. Highs and lows are well defined but not overpowering. Just clean. Mids are crystal clear. That is what we used to dream about in the old days. I couldn't see spending the money on a better one when these do so well and they do not require a lot of tracking force.

Second, the performance of AT's is second-to-none for the P-mount form-factor.  Those of us, myself included, with a turntable taking this format find ourselves with dwindling options.  When I decided to replace the cartridge I bought my used Denon DP-7F with, I was nervous as I liked the sound the ADC (no model anywhere!) was putting out.  I ordered an AT3482 initially, which it turns out is an entry model void of any depth and life.  Harsh and cold, I disappointingly put the original back (aware with an unknown number of hours on the clock it could be wearing my vinyl faster), and I got Amazon to kindly take the 3482 back and sell me a 311EP.\n\nImmediately apparent was the increased clarity, depth, spatial separation, and eventually came the greater warmth.  It was sufficient off the bat, but I found (and have read others have had the same experience) that some time in, it gets the groove (pun intended) and shows its true colors.  I can say this was the case for me, and as long as you keep it clean with a stylus cleaner you will have a very pleasant experience.\n\nI can also say that a friend's house with Magnepan speakers off a vintage Carver amp and a Technics turntable with a very similar model cartridge gave depth and spatialization out of this world for this price point on Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here.\n\nThe instructions when you open the packaging tell you (out of an abundance of caution I hope) to remove the stylus from the cartridge when installing, then reinsert.  This looks easy on paper, but I couldn't get it to separate, and I was applying more than sufficient force to my thinking.  I can see why, you could bump into the needle with one of your fingers while pushing into the tonearm and then game over, but you just hold it by the sides, slide it in, then screw it down, and less than a minute later all is well.  You can't really make adjustments on the P-mount system, so you will get it right and without delay.\n-------------------------------------------------------Below applies to the AT100E----------------------------------------\nJust installed a month ago in a 1979 Dual 1264.  The Pickering XV15 from some time ago had the vintage look, and after I'd restored the Dual I tried to keep that look intact, starting with a new stylus to replace the original D400.  Turned out the tunnel the stylus went into was worn, and the assembly itself would come loose with playing and that of course is dangerous and resulted in poor sound.  Another $90 in to a labor of love, and enter the AT100E, which looks good and sounds good.\n\nRight off the bat, one difference between it and the EV stylus I tried to replace the D400 with (and even the AT311EP's I love) was that out of the box the sound was natural.  The EV stylus had lots of surface noise for a few hours, then dramatically settled down (I also cleaned it once but that didn't seem to do much), the AT311EP's settle down nicely after about 5-10 hours.  I've got about 20 hours on the clock with this one and it hasn't changed, which is impressive to me; maybe this will change in months' time.\n\nI am running the tracking force (at the recommendation of the shop that restored the Dual) close to the upper limit of 1.8 (I'm at 1.75, while the manual states optimal is 1.4).  The anti-staking is just shy of 2, and every so often it seems the right channel has some distortion which may mean I need to make a skating adjustment, but I have no blank vinyl to test it on (yet).\n\nThe needle doesn't ride quite as low as the AT311EP, which appears dangerously close to the vinyl, but never touches, even with a warp.  I miss the dust cap on the old cartridge\/stylus, but am glad to stick with AT.  Much of my vinyl isn't new, esoteric 180g limited edition purchases, more of the good and great shape used copies from the Bay Area and Sacramento (a haven for collectors), so getting into the diminishing return rare air of uber equipment is not my gig.\n\nThe bass could use some extra umph, but what is there is warm and not overwhelming.  Highs are very natural and never harsh.  Jazz such as Miles Davis' Kind of Blue and Maynard really show the brass instruments and percussion.  LOTS of stereo separation, impressive staging if you sit in the sweet spot of your speakers.","summary":"Please offer the AT311EP forever, Audio Technica!","unixReviewTime":1435363200,"vote":4.0,"style":{"Style:":" AT311EP Phonograph Cartridge"},"image":null}

{"overall":5,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"03 24, 2015","reviewerID":"A2KI91IR3RA7D0","asin":"B00006HO3L","reviewerName":"David L. Vasser","reviewText":"No makers I know about are producing a turntable that has a P-Mount tone arm.  For legacy turntables that require a P-Mount\/T4P cartridge along with a record collection in excellent condition your choices for something better than a \"starter\" cartridge in the $25 to $70 range continue to dwindle.  Many major cartridge makers have eliminated all but their lesser P-Mount cartridges while others like Ortofon stopped making any T4P (P-mount) cartridge at all.  The AT-311EP is possibly the best sounding P-Mount cartridge still widely available at a price that about anyone can afford.  This AT311EP is not the best T4P\/P- Mount cartridge ever made or even the best one still available at any price but in the price range it performs way beyond the cost.  (If you have more money to spend the Grado Black T4P is $75 and the Gold Grado T4P is something over $200.  The AT311EP specs approach the Grado Black for way less money.)\n\nAudio-Technica actually recently listed this AT311EP as \"discontinued\" on their website, so I thought those in the supply chain were all there would be. The ATN3472SE replacement stylus is safe since the AT92ECD uses the same stylus and that cartridge was not discontinued.  Then came good news that for some unknown reason Audio-Technica changed their mind so the AT311EP webpage no longer carries the \"discontinued\" stamping as of 04\/04\/2015.  So the AT311EP has been snatched back from the jaws of death. Very unusual for a discontinued product to make a comeback, but I'm glad and it was a good save.\n\nThe AT311EP is better than even other AT cartridges that look cosmetically identical, such as the AT92ECD, which costs a few dollars less.  The others are cheaper but the extra few bucks for the AT311EP is a good investment. The first reason I say the AT311EP is better is the ATN3472SE stylus used on both the AT311EP and AT92ECD is elliptical (also known as bi-radial) and is not conical (also known as spherical.)  This particular stylus is very narrow so it goes deeper into the groove than other elliptical styli in the cartridge's price range. The difference seems to matter less sound wise with a 45, but with a 33 microgroove album in excellent condition the difference in higher frequencies is obvious.  The AT92ECD cartridge has nearly identical specs to the AT311EP in all regards except for a 30% lower output voltage of 3.5 mv instead of the robust 5.0 mv output on this AT311EP.  The higher output of the AT311EP translates to a stronger signal for an improved signal to noise ratio.  To me the significantly higher output voltage from the AT311EP is more than worth the few dollars difference.\n\nAs an alternative choice the Shure M92E is another widely available and popular P-Mount elliptical option and a fair value too.  Shure now calls the M92E stylus \"bi-radial\" yet suffix that model with an \"E\" which has almost always has meant there is an elliptical stylus in a Shure phono cartridge.\n\nThe second reason I say the AT311EP is maybe the best affordable P-Mount cartridge left is the overall specs compared to others in the price class.  In output voltage it equals the Shure M92E but surpasses it in almost every other category and it should since the Audio-Technica is slightly more expensive.  Of course specs can be manipulated to say whatever the manufacturer wants by leaving out things like + or - dB or the specific frequency of a measurement tone.  However in the case of the AT311EP the incredibly wide range of reproduction specified at 15-27,000 Hz clues you into it being a very bright cartridge that also has a big low end.  AT does not spec a dB plus or minus tolerance in their frequency response spec, but the AT311EP has a brighter and more airy character than the Shure M92E while being equally robust in output and it exceeds the Shure in channel separation and channel balance specs.  The airy tone in the AT311EP cartridge works great with clean records in excellent shape but it can get annoyingly noisy on worn bargain bin records.\n\nShould you ever choose the Shure M92E over the AT311EP?  Yes.  When you have records in only fair to good shape and they are not perfectly clean the Shure M92E would be a more prudent choice since it tames at least some of surface noise present in worn or dirty discs.  So when should you choose the AT311EP?  When you have clean records in excellent shape and a system capable of doing something with the extra high frequencies it can pass.  The Shure by virtue of it's less pronounced high frequency voicing will sound better with less apparent surface noise when playing noisy records. The Shure is also going to collect a bit less dust from deep in the grooves since it doesn't go as deep where the real trash collects.  I've noticed the slightly narrower stylus on the AT311EP tends to collect way more stuff from old neglected records because it goes deeper in grooves where dust is next to impossible to remove with traditional record cleaning pads and carbon fiber brushes.  I can't get to some of that dust and gunk on used records from a second-hand store by using a Discwasher pad cleaner but the AT311EP stylus sure can.  When you have an excellent to near mint clean groove you can turn the treble up and the AT will sound far more airy without surface noise or distortion.\n\nI think the low distortion on the highs is a real strong point of the AT311EP.  It isn't brittle, it is clean.  I put on a really good copy of a very good recording (\"What's New\" by Linda Ronstadt with Nelson Riddle) and heard detail I frankly had never heard before with the Shure M92E.  On the other hand I put on a used bargain bin copy of an old Dells LP and even though I cleaned it best I could with the Discwasher and a carbon fiber brush the AT stylus collected so much stuff from deep in the groove I had to stop playing each side to clean off the dust clogged stylus and then resume play numerous times.\n\nBoth the AT311EP and Shure M92E are very light tracking cartridges with an optimum of 1 to 1.25 grams.  Neither should ever be used at more than 1.5 grams. The 1kH 29dB channel separation specs on the AT311EP are far better than the 1kH 20dB spec on the Shure M92E and darn close to the Grado Black's 30dB.  The channel balance specs on the AT311EP are slightly better than the M92E also, by 0.75 dB. The AT311EP uses a .1 mil narrower stylus so it goes a wee bit deeper into the groove than the Shure M92E which accounts for both some of the added brightness and turning it into a better dust collector on old neglected records.  The Shure has the advantage of a lower cost stylus replacement because the ATN3472SE stylus used in the AT311EP is harder to make since it is slightly narrower and because the AT's are imported from Japan.  Both the Shure and AT styli are diamond, thus about equally durable but the AT replacement is going to cost you more and stylus replacement cost matters to some people.  If you play a LOT of records or just like changing your stylus every few hundred hours then the Shure might be a money saver in the long run, but if you have a system capable of true fidelity the Shure simply is not as airy on the high end of the audio spectrum.\n\nIn an affordable P-Mount cartridge the AT311EP and the Shure M92E are the ones to consider right now for under $50.  Of the two the AT311EP sounds much better to me.  So P-Mount choices have narrowed dramatically in the past few years with most of the better P-Mount cartridges already gone and this midline AT311EP apparently barely escaping death. I love my old linear tracking turntable that uses P-Mount cartridges and this AT cartridge makes it sound way better to me. While it isn't the best in the world it beats the Shure in the high frequencies and for under $75 the AT311EP is the best P-Mount left that I know about.  I am perfectly happy with it when playing clean records in good shape but not as happy with older worn records.  This AT cartridge is not very forgiving at all.  Wear and scratches are going to be very apparent.  If it has a fault, it is clarity.\n\nIf you have a good stereo with a decent P-Mount turntable that tracks at 1.5 grams down to 1.0 gram with a record collection in above average shape this AT is possibly the best and brightest P-Mount elliptical cartridge left at under $70 for you.  If you have a system that doesn't pass much over 15k Hertz or records in less than ideal shape the Shure would be fine because you probably would not hear anything over 18k Hertz from your system anyway.\n\nEven though this AT311EP, the Shure M92E plus other AT cartridges are touted as \"Universal Mount\" and come with components included to adapt them to a traditional half-inch headshell mount, I would never suggest any P-Mount (T4P) cartridge for anything but a P-Mount tonearm.  There are better half-inch cartridges available for around the same money or just a bit more that are easier to setup on a half-inch mount headshell. The adapter components included with the \"universal\" cartridges add weight that frequently is hard to compensate for to get the tracking down to the 1.5 gram maximum and also add height that can cause setup complications such as an off tracking angle requiring shimming of the front mounting of the cartridge plus there can be azimuth angle compensation issues.  Mounting a half-inch cartridge is hard enough, don't make it harder by using a \"universal\" mount cartridge.\n\nThe lone surviving Shure P-Mount cartridge is a fair cartridge and I've used it before, but it is not as airy as the AT311EP.  I gave the AT311EP 5 stars because while there were better P-Mount cartridges available at a sane price there now are not any better ones.  So a 4 star cartridge by default becomes 5 star in absence of the better models that are gone. The next step up is the Grado Black and for the casual non-audiophile listener like me with consumer grade components, while very nice, a Grado would be overkill.  The AT311EP is a steal right now costing less than dinner and a movie.  Unless you spend $75 you just can't do any better in a P-Mount than this.","summary":"Going...going...but NOT yet gone!","unixReviewTime":1427155200,"vote":6.0,"style":{"Style:":" AT311EP Phonograph Cartridge"},"image":null}

They're light weight and the cups are small. The sound quality is ABSOLUTELY good enough to monitor yourself playing as you record. If you're on a budget and can't afford anything else, listening to music is enjoyable on these, though I wouldn't exactly use them strictly for this purpose. I use them for recording and they put out a pretty hot signal. Noise canceling not because they're designed that way, but noise canceling because I can get them loud enough to drown out the noise of my guitar strings so all I'm hearing is the mix and me.\n\nThe cord is brilliantly long. I have a 20 foot extension on mine, but honestly, I don't need it at all.\n\nBottom line is if you can afford it, yes, buy higher quality headphones for studio monitoring. OR if you're buying in bulk and want to save money for when a group comes in to play all at once, these will do the trick...get the job done. And if someone questions you on them, lie and say they're a knock of version of Beats by Dre without the fancy logo and hardware, but the internal stuff is the same.

Put it in a Marantz 6300, installed it in the bedroom, and got some great new records.  At first I was a little disappointed with the sound.  It was a bit thin.  I thought that the Pickering might have aged out and perhaps the internals had dried up, hardened or softened just sitting in the case for all those years. Tried several receivers with good phono preamps but the results varied little.  Dug out some vintage external preamps but was still not delighted.  I finally got the Shure SFG-2 Tracking Force Gauge.  That was the missing link in my meticulous setup.  I've had some fine cartridges over the years, but few had the little brush attachment. Never felt the need for a brush.  I take good care of my records.  They are clean and static free.  But despite my best efforts, I quickly learned how notoriously inaccurate the calibration of even a good tonearm can be if you don't have a proper way to measure the tracking force.  Turned out the extra gram I thought I had added per the manufacturers spec to compensate for the brush was not even close.  So I used the guage, got a good reference for the stylus, added the extra gram, checked again and now I'm blasting Miles Davis Jack Johnson.  It's full, bright, has a nice throbbing bottom end.  No skips, no rumble.  A world of difference and I owe it all to getting the tracking dialed in with the help of this sweet little gauge.  Talk about money well spent!  Now I'll be setting up my Technics SL-1200 MK2 with a Stanton 681EEE downstairs in my studio.  I use that table more and I think it is pretty well balanced, but soon I will know for certain. Lesson learned.  You can't set up a good turntable without a good tracking gauge.  This is the best one I've ever used. Don't see any reason to spend big bucks on a digital gauge.  This is accurate and inexpensive and an essential tool for serious vinyl lovers.","summary":"Magnificent.

The pickup pattern is tighter and the frequency response is fuller. It probably has the ability to handle a higher sound pressure level also, but most won't care about that.\n\nThe pickup pattern is so tight that you will usually want to be within an inch of the windscreen, but this is why you won't get feedback as easily from it. Well, you know how you have to work the mic to adjust for louder and softer, now you'll just be working it at a closer distance, just remember to roll off the lows to reduce the proximity effect. But this is probably just it's biggest benefit of many, although it also makes it a bad choice for using one mic in front of three singers.\n\nThis microphone speaks of quality and durability in your hand, it's solid and heavy. The handling noise is excellent for those of you using this as a hand held microphone, it's quiet. It's frequency response drops down to 40Hz, making it an excellent choice for an instrument mic also. This will do a good job on close up work with guitar cabs to brass, providing excellent rejection of other sounds, The bottom of a snare or anyplace that you want a high rejection ratio, and can also fit this size of microphone.\n\nSo for those of you looking for it double as a recording microphone, because where you are recording has a high noise floor, it will work out well also. Being a studio owner, I suggest the quietest possible place to record and a low noise floor, but I know that it's not always possible. It will do a great job of rejecting other sound and focusing on what it's in front of.\n\nYou'll get a good clip and an average carry bag with it.\n\nIt's a good, high quality microphone at a fairly low price, and I can recommend it.","summary":"Very Nice Microphone","unixReviewTime":1440288000,"vote":11.0,"style":null,"image":null}

Foster","reviewText":"I bought this to use for a series of video interviews but found it to fall far below my expectations.  I have been an avid Audio-Technica user for years and love their pro microphones.  I was hoping this would be similar in quality but my results were mixed.\n\nFirst of all, the sound quality from the microphone itself is fantastic for the price.  It is clear and crisp without being too bright.  It sounds far better than I expected for a microphone of this price.\n\nHowever, the output level of it is very low and makes it pretty much worthless.  I tried to use it four different ways and found only one of them to be usable, though it still sounded bad.\n\nThe first way was plugged directly into a camcorder.  It sounded great for about a minute or two but then the sound would fade out and for the rest of the recording, there was nothing but silence.  I attribute this more to the camcorder and not the mic since I have had other weird sound issues with other external sources on that camera.\n\nThe second way was on a different camera.  That camera has some sort of automatic gain control that boosted the mic up so loud that it was actually distorted the sound on the loud parts while bringing up the noise floor of the whole thing to about -18dbfs.  Obviously, this wasn't working the way I wanted it to.\n\nI then plugged it into the mic jack on my laptop and recorded the sound straight into the computer.  This was the only useful way that I found it would work but, because of the low output level, there was a lot of noise in the recording when boosting it to a normal level.  The background noise using this method came out to be around -26dbfs.  Though still pretty poor sounding, this would be usable.\n\nThe fourth way I tried it was my connecting it to an XLR adapter and plugging it into a pro mic preamp.  Again, the output was far too low and I got as much noise as I did usable signal.\n\nIn summary, if you have a camera that will match to the output level of this mic, you will get good sound.  However, I wouldn't hold out much hope that many cameras will meet that expectation.  Of course, at less than $20, you can probably afford to give it a shot.  I am giving it three stars mainly for the sound quality and the chance that I may eventually find a way to use it effectively.","summary":"Decent but not great","unixReviewTime":1218499200,"vote":15.0,"style":null,"image":null}

I had a Shure RX3P cartridge on it, so I went looking for a replacement. This model is it. And it fit perfectly, and plays my old records with decent sound reproduction. I have old 70s Panny speakers, since I didn't have the room for the big Technics when we moved (Those are being enjoyed by a friend). So i cut the RCA plugs off of them and stuck the wires into the back of my old Sony reciever and they work.\n\nAnyway, back to the needle. This fit in perfectly to my RX3P cartridge. As soon as it was installed, I went thumbing thru my record bins to figure out what to play, and decided on a couple Moody Blues LPs. They sounded fantastic. I'm so glad I can play my records again.\n\nEdit: I ended up recording some albums on my Sony ICD digital recorder I bought here (love it!) to put on cd. This needle really does the trick, especialy thru my Sony amplifier.

It's very \"neutral\" and uncolored which is a real plus. However, upper frequencies-cymbals, \"s's\" etc.-can sometimes get muddy depending on the recording. Don't let this scare you. This cart will track almost anything! If you can find a Shure 104E stylus to replace the stock stylus you'll be pleasantly surprised at how good the 92E cartridge really sounds! I only give it 4 stars because the stock stylus is a little lacking on the high end, at least to my ear anyway! Good overall value especially given that it's a \"universal\" mounting  system.\n\n10+Year Follow up (10-18-15)-Dusted off a back up Technics p-mount table while my main one's being serviced. Installed a new belt and picked up 2 new carts (a Shure M92E and an Audio Technica AT 92E)  for a comparison while the Big Dog's away. Played each with their stock stylus for about 10 hours before listening. Tough call as to which one sounds better to my ear. The AT definately has more upper frequency detail BUT the Shure sounds more \"full, balanced and warmer.\" In my opinion, the Shure produces more of that \"classic vinyl sound\" than the AT. Choose whichever \"flavor\" suits you best. You won't go wrong either way. A good preamp helps. BTW, each cart's stock stylus can be easily upgraded. FYI, replaced the stock Shure .4 X .7 elliptical stylus with a JICO .3 X .7 elliptical, 776 DEX. Still sounds warm and full but with much more detail and \"authority.\"\n\n12-5-15 Update. Upgraded the stylus on my Shure M97 XE with an after market hyper elliptical - great improvement!  Took the newly \"spare\"  M97 XE stylus and installed it on the M92E running on a p-mount table. It weighed about 1.25 grams more than the p-mount tracking standard of 1.25 grams. Didn't want to increase the tonearm mass by adding weight behind the pivot point. So, I carefully removed the 97XE's stabilizer brush assembly from the stylus assembly with a utility knife then reinstalled it. However, it now weighed in a bit under 1.25 grams. Added a small blob of Blu Tack on the top of the cart to correct the tracking force weight, molded it to conform then painted it black. What a sonic improvement! Best sounding \"M92E\" yet!!

You don't compare it to a 2 foot long mic that costs 15x as much and is clearly for professional use.  It's meant for the home moviemaker who is unhappy with the builtin mic on their camcorder which has an external 1\/8\" mono mic jack  -- yes, this is a MONO output so it will likely only appear on one of two channels if you put it in a stereo mic jack leaving the other one empty.  You might want to build or buy a dual mono to a single stereo adapter so you can capture audio from 2 mic sources on tape when using this.  It will give you more editing options later when you read your tape + 2 audio tracks into your software.\n\nWhat it does best is replace that built in microphone on your DV handheld recorder that picks up the motor noise and every click of the buttons you press.  It does tend to reject your voice if you whisper to the person next to you, perhaps to adjust the lighting.  The package comes with two mic holders, one for a hot-shoe (no electrical connections) and one for a traditional mic stand\/arm.  AT made a complete kit out of this unit.\n\nIt uses a single AA battery which should last for a long time.  Some advice - toss the included battery in your pile and buy a good one that won't leak.  I recommend the L91 lithium AA batteries because of their long life and long storage without leakage.  This is a battery you won't be replacing for a couple years so it's best to put a high quality one in to begin with since you'll forget it.  The L91 also provides about 2x the usage of a normal alkaline battery, but it costs ~2x as much so it works out in the end as a wash.\n\nOne note - the picture shows a nice metal mini 1\/8->1\/4 adapter but what is included in the kit is plastic and lacks the screw-on threads to keep it from pulling out.  The cable is fixed to the microphone and not replacable like professional equipment, but again it's not at that price point.\n\nUse this and your videos will sound alot better.  The next step up is a wireless mic and receiver package for really long distances.  I have used several of these and they make for excellent tapes of a single subject willing to wear the mic and transmitter.  With the shotgun mic you are ready to go no matter who or what you are recording.\n\nI think you'll be impressed with what you get for your money here.","summary":"Good audio considering it doesn't cost $750!","unixReviewTime":1208736000,"vote":3.0,"style":null,"image":null}

It's very \"neutral\" and uncolored which is a real plus. However, upper frequencies-cymbals, \"s's\" etc.-can sometimes get muddy depending on the recording. Don't let this scare you. This cart will track almost anything! If you can find a Shure 104E stylus to replace the stock stylus you'll be pleasantly surprised at how good the 92E cartridge really sounds! I only give it 4 stars because the stock stylus is a little lacking on the high end, at least to my ear anyway! Good overall value especially given that it's a \"universal\" mounting  system.\n\n10+Year Follow up (10-18-15)-Dusted off a back up Technics p-mount table while my main one's being serviced. Installed a new belt and picked up 2 new carts (a Shure M92E and an Audio Technica AT 92E)  for a comparison while the Big Dog's away. Played each with their stock stylus for about 10 hours before listening. Tough call as to which one sounds better to my ear. The AT definately has more upper frequency detail BUT the Shure sounds more \"full, balanced and warmer.\" In my opinion, the Shure produces more of that \"classic vinyl sound\" than the AT. Choose whichever \"flavor\" suits you best. You won't go wrong either way. A good preamp helps. BTW, each cart's stock stylus can be easily upgraded. FYI, replaced the stock Shure .4 X .7 elliptical stylus with a JICO .3 X .7 elliptical, 776 DEX. Still sounds warm and full but with much more detail and \"authority.\"\n\n12-5-15 Update. Upgraded the stylus on my Shure M97 XE with an after market hyper elliptical - great improvement!  Took the newly \"spare\"  M97 XE stylus and installed it on the M92E running on a p-mount table. It weighed about 1.25 grams more than the p-mount tracking standard of 1.25 grams. Didn't want to increase the tonearm mass by adding weight behind the pivot point. So, I carefully removed the 97XE's stabilizer brush assembly from the stylus assembly with a utility knife then reinstalled it. However, it now weighed in a bit under 1.25 grams. Added a small blob of Blu Tack on the top of the cart to correct the tracking force weight, molded it to conform then painted it black. What a sonic improvement! Best sounding \"M92E\" yet!!

I had a Shure RX3P cartridge on it, so I went looking for a replacement. This model is it. And it fit perfectly, and plays my old records with decent sound reproduction. I have old 70s Panny speakers, since I didn't have the room for the big Technics when we moved (Those are being enjoyed by a friend). So i cut the RCA plugs off of them and stuck the wires into the back of my old Sony reciever and they work.\n\nAnyway, back to the needle. This fit in perfectly to my RX3P cartridge. As soon as it was installed, I went thumbing thru my record bins to figure out what to play, and decided on a couple Moody Blues LPs. They sounded fantastic. I'm so glad I can play my records again.\n\nEdit: I ended up recording some albums on my Sony ICD digital recorder I bought here (love it!) to put on cd. This needle really does the trick, especialy thru my Sony amplifier. Of course, I had to fix the speed digitally, and tweak some pops & clicks in my computer recording software, but still worth the extra work needed.","summary":"Works for RX3P cartridges","unixReviewTime":1358640000,"vote":2.0,"style":{"style:":" Replacement Needle"},"image":null}

Martin","reviewText":"I've changed my entire review to try to clarify some things about microphones and \"phantom\" power.  \"Phantom Power\" is a term that describes a power source required for \"Condenser\" type microphones.  It is usually 48V @ 7mA which is active on the cable that connects the microphone to the amplifier.  I suspect it is called \"Phantom\" power, because there is no indication that it is there, except that a condenser microphone won't work without it.  Sometimes, a condenser microphone will have its own power source, usually a battery, to provide the electrical power for the microphone circuitry.\n\nWhen considering microphone choices, two rules come to mind.\n\n\"Dynamic\" microphones, do not, and cannot use \"phantom\" power.  If you connect a dynamic microphone to a microphone port that provides phantom power, you will have a broken dynamic microphone.  Sometimes there is a switch to turn off any phantom power.\n\n\"Condenser\" microphones, on the other hand, DO REQUIRE phantom power and usually cost more than dynamic microphones, because they have internal electronics that require a power source, i.e. Phantom Power.\n\nEven though it does not mention the microphone type, based on the price alone, I can tell you that this is probably a dynamic type microphone and if it sounds terrible at 8 bucks, then it probably sounds like a cheap microphone.","summary":"Just a clarification about Microphone Phantom Power","unixReviewTime":1385683200,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

I own several guitars.  I just purchased this for my nine-year-old daughter.  I had originally ordered a Luna Aurora Faerie guitar but sent it back.  The Luna was mostly plastic and assembled so poorly, that calling it anything but a toy would be untrue.  The Yamaha is another story.  It actually has a spruce top, wooden bridge and adjustable truss bar.  It is a real guitar in every sense of the word.  It is a true 3\/4 scale guitar despite was others with little or no knowledge of guitars have posted.  The out-of-box action (string height) is good and can be played \"as is.\"  For a better experience, it should be taken to a guitar shop and adjusted (set up) properly.  Action is adjusted by raising or lowering the neck or bridge nut, not by adjusting the truss rod - as many people attempt to do.\n\nAs to the sound, it's great!  A 3\/4 scale guitar is not going to project loud, but it's tone is very pleasing.  I would recommend getting light strings (11-47 or thinner) for a beginner.  The guitar stays in tune well, I have not had a problem with the tuners as others have claimed.  The neck and frets are first class.  The size is perfect for a child.

Mesa","reviewText":"Who says you have to spend an x amount of hundreds even thousands of dollars on a phono cartridge to listen to crisp and detailed vinyl\/analog playback ? However, words like crisp and detailed are very meager adjectives to describe the musical sonic characteristics of this cartridge (true, the rest of your component system's own sound characteristics come into play, i.e; receiver,amp,pre-amp,turntable,speakers).If any part of your audio system does not have that \"synergy\", then you may notice either slight, miniscule shortcomings from the cartridge or system or both. For those with already a warm or neutral sounding system will be dramatically surprised and awestruck. For those who have just the opposite type of system and also may have an eq inline, you may want to adjust your treble settings. The AT 440ML is NOT a neutral or \"warm\" sounding cartridge---far from it. The upper mids and highs will possibly have your dog running out of the room. It's not bass shy either. Bass is firm  but never muddy or boomy. It reproduces the lows and highs very well. There are no punchy mids (though the mids are reproduced admirably but not accurately). Some critics have said this cartridge out of the box and installed properly is reminiscent of having an inline equalizer and it's frequency knob controls in the \"v\" formation. Stereo channel separation is probably the best these ears have heard over any other stereo cartridge I have had in the past (from the Grado Prestige Series to a couple of high-end Shure cartridges).There is definitely a 3-dimensional sonic imaging characteristic in the AT 440ML (especially noted with acoustic and jazz music). The Audio Technica beats most other hi end named brands to the punch with such wide stereo stage channel separation. I have closed my eyes with headphones on or with speakers and I always hear and experience the \"you are there\" feeling that makes me appreciate records much more than the cold 2-dimensional flat sound of audio cd's. Female vocals have a soft but clear presence. Male vocals are well reproduced. The micro-linear stylus reaches deep into the grooves without carving the vinyl (YES ! a wonderful light tracker that requires anywhere from .8 to 1.6 g of tracking force).This will cut down on the wear and tear of your vinyl collection as well as your cartridge\/stylus...\n\nDoes this mean that the AT 440ML is PERFECT and that you have finally reached analog playback nirvana??? Well, that depends on different viewpoints. If you have bought cheap cartridges all your life in the $20 to $40 range, then this AT 440ML will be an audio revelation that will have you realize what you have been missing all this time. BUT, it's only a taste of the high end, audiophile analog world. If you have had other hi-end name brand cartridges (an experienced audiophile) and have paid more than what this cartridge is going for, then from a monetary stance you may have paid too much---that is IF the AT's sound rivals or is reminiscent of those pricier carts. On the other hand, if you prefer the warm, neutral sound to your liking, and possibly don't want to experience ear and mind fatigue from a bright cartridge then do not buy this cartridge. The AT 440 ML is a colored (soundwise) cartridge. You will only become ear fatigued if you are used to more neutral or warm cartridges (this is where you will need to adjust your treble settings). As with most cartridges, the AT 440 ML does require a little bit of \"breaking-in\" period (some say 30 hours to maybe 50---depending on your playback time habits). I have owned the AT 440ML for over a year now and it does get more looser or liquid-like, smooth and sweeter in sound(but not warm or dull) with no harsh or grainy sonic characteristics (sounds like I'm describing a fine liquor or malt shake).\n\nThe last glaring question (probably one of the most important) is whether or not this is an excellent tracker (and this is a two-fold question or concern). Are words beginning with s, t, p, and f accurately reproduced (sibilance)? Yes and no. That honorary distinction would be for the Shure V15VxMR cartridge (which is now out of production and was the last of a dying audiophile cartridge breed to be had for a reasonable price range). With the AT 440ML it's more hit than miss with sibilants. About 85% to 90% of the time \"spitty\" consonants are pronounced accurately with a slight edge or exaggeration. However, there have been a few of my clean records where the letter \"s\" cuts through with that static-like harshness more than once on any given side. One such record I have that proves this theory and shortcoming of this cartridge is  Joe Jackson's Jumpin' Jive swing jazz album (the letter s is tracked harshly with that annoying edgy sound). As for overall tracking quality of the music signal in general from beginning of groove to end, it has that inner groove distortion problem licked (this is where the AT 440ML shows off it's greatest audiophile strength). This is due to the linear contact stylus. Nothing MORE aggravating to a record listener than when a low budget or poorly produced cartridge, while it may sound clear and great in the first few tracks on a record side, but then as the needle goes towards the center, the last tracks suffer horribly (no matter how much anti-skate force you apply)! You will no longer have this problem with the AT 440ML; you will finally find out what you have been missing.\n\nKeep in mind that this deep-groove tracing microlinear stylus by design,in picking up such fine musical detail, will also pick up record surface noise and dirt;That's right, that snap,crackle, and pop from static,dirt, or lint. Majority of micro-linear cartridges will do that as opposed to conical or elliptical styli that sort of tend to almost try to soften,mask or even blend out surface record noise.  Conical or elliptical styli,with their larger \"footprint\" tip, will push dirt and other debris out of the way on the record's surface. They also do not reach deep into the groove and make that much of an accurate contact with the groove's wall as a microlinear stylus does. The microlinear stylus will reach deeper into the groove where there is more accumulated dirt or debris;it's a fact(being a light tracker however, this will not wear out your records as fast as a regular stylus cartrdige would). So, I also recommend using an anti-static brush on those not so pristine records. This is the only other area where maybe it's competitor ,the Shure M97xE cartridge, might come out a little ahead; Shures are well known and admired for their almost quiet record surface noise playback and background !\n\nThe bottom line, with both thumbs highly up, I absolutely recommend this fine cartridge. Period. Especially for a novice to the vinyl world or someone on a budget. I have found it difficult to listen to cd's or any digital musical format since owning this cartridge. In fact, I get bored with cd playback nowadays. There's just no musical \"involvement\".Don't be fooled by the simple black and lavender\/purple? colored simple looking cartridge. It's what's on the inside of the body that really counts ! The AT 440ML possesses that bang for the buck quality that is hard to beat and will revitalize your long yearning for super (not perfect) audiophile listening and extract nuances and other fine qualities from your record collection !","summary":"One of the Best Budget Minded Audiophile Cartridges Around","unixReviewTime":1102982400,"vote":98.0,"style":null,"image":null}

For overall detail, though, the AT 440MLa is hard to beat and the pricing through an Amazon reseller was the best I found anywhere. AT cartridges are also not fussy about cable capacitance (\"loading\"), unlike some cartridges such as the better Shures and a few others. If your tonearm can handle a high compliance cartridge, I highly recommend this. You can get replacement styli, too, unlike some of the more esoteric moving-coil designs which are very pricey.

My set up for this job is a Denon DP-45f turntable running straight through an amazing 1975 vintage Marantz 3600 preamp that's been completely refurbished to original specs, then to the ProTools inputs with custom made Mogami cables by ProLA Audio. My previous (other) cartridge is a Denon DL110 high output moving coil (also purchased a few months ago for this labor of love)\n\nAfter a careful set up using the Hi Fi News test record, where this cartridge tracked noticably better than the Denon, after about a dozen LP's tracking at 1.7 grams (tho 1.4 is suggested, 1.8 is the max and this tested best for my set up), my observations are (positives 1st):\n\n1) This cartridge has noticably, and I mean NOTICABLY, better tracking ability. Inner groove distortion is all but eliminated on records that I had deemed un-rippable with the Denon cartridge.\n\n2) Surface noise is also noticably lower (over 7db measured through ProTools in A\/B recordings of the same record passages between tracks). Pops and clicks are also diminished greatly-as a guestimate I'd say over a third to almost half, but that is truly subjective based on the damage done by previous playings on my particular used records.\n\nThe negatives (in relation to my other set up)\n\n1) The AT cartridge doesn't sound as good as the Denon on prime vinyl. It has a smaller soundstage (less \"open air\" around the instruments). Also, The highs have a decidedly more metallic sound on cymbals and hi-hats, etc. Silibance issues are also more pronounced-not totally harsh but again more prominent than the Denon, which when the vinyl is worthy is a joyous listening experience. I'm sure this will lessen on the AT as I get another 50 hours or so on the cartridge, and even when the silibance is more pronounced there's no truly annoying inner groove distortion to go with it.\n\n2) The AT cartridge is 50% more than the Denon.\n\nBut, to all but eliminate the nagging issue of having to buy 2 copies (or more) of certain records and even then, more often than not, not completely solving the IGD problem, I surely would have saved the price of the AT cartridge considering the 150 LP's and counting I've done so far. The combination of the two cartridges for me solves an issue that was hindering the amazing amount of fun I've been having ever since I realized I've been lied to all along when they told me digital was better :-)\n\nMy only other \"issue\" is not with the cartridge, but with Amazon. They've been getting slack on \"fulfilling\" Prime orders when the item is from a third party vendor but \"in stock\". I had to again call customer service when this item didn't show up as promised. (the second time in three months). The person was very friendly, saying there was an internal error with the processing. When I ordered a second one overnight just to make sure I'd get one in time for my listening party, she waved the additional shipping and Ok'd the return while I was on the phone-a nice gesture even if it is a mute one with the full refund upon return. They both showed up the next day.\n\nWith ALL that said, this is a great solution that I can not be happier that I discovered by research and reading other reviews on Amazon.

It is no longer the audiphile steal of the decade, and thus needs to be juxtaposed to its competition.\n\nFurthermore, it requires a very low mass tonearm to get the right resonance synergy due to the very high compliance and low downforce.  All Technics and most Rega arms, for instance, are mid-mass.\n\nFor a hundred bucks a replacement tip nowadays, you might as well get into mid-compliance moving coil designs, which by their very nature have extremely low effective tip mass due to there being only coils rather than heavier magnets on the cantilever end on the other side of the pivot inside.  You can't replace the stylus yourself on an MC, but you're practically paying the cost of a whole new cart on the 440MLa anyway at these prices.\n\nAs was also proven with the Shure V15 series before it, the diamond cut and cantilever material can be instrumental in giving a moving magnet\/moving iron design low effective tip mass, but there is a diminishing return.  MC designs with such improvements are even lower tip mass.  If the price ever comes back down on the replacement tips to a reasonable price, then certainly snatch them up.  It's an incredible MM design.","summary":"WAS a great bargain","unixReviewTime":1246579200,"vote":25.0,"style":null,"image":null}

These are seasoned veterans who have no interest in gear per se and even less interest in brand cachet.  It's all about money to them.  I couldn't believe it when I first saw the group using these Nady mics (even lower-priced several years ago) and insisting they were as good as Shure SM-57's and 58's.  I still don't believe the quality of workmanship compares (any casual empirical test of build quality will prove as much).  But these Nady's handle the announcing, the vocals, and, when needed, the softer sounding instruments (flute, harmonica), and none has broken or quit on my watch.\n\nI'm a keyboardist, so mic power and fidelity don't affect me.  I'm only a trifle mortified when there are musicians in the audience who catch on to how cheap we are when it comes to the all-important \"gear component.\"  At the same time, my embarrassment, I confess, is not unmixed with a bit of demonic glee.

Today I am online to purchase two more to replace the \"professional\" mic's supplied by another band member for the rest of the vocalists.  The other mics are nothing but feedback generators, and sound far too thin compared to this Nady.  This mic is not quite as responsive as my Shure SM58, but it's close enough for live music, and the price just can't be beat.  This mic is nice and hefty, and the quality of materials used in construction is very apparent.  Frankly, I don't understand how anybody can really be profiting from building and shipping them for this price.  So far I haven't had any issues with the supplied cable, but if the professional in you can't tolerate the thought of singing through a 1\/4\" jack, you can use it with an XLR cable purchased separately.  My only complaint is that it has a cheesy label wrapped around it just beneath the screen that absolutely screams \"karaoke mic\".

I have been pleased with the results. The guitar amp modeling is decent but, I like the bass amp modeling a little better. Some of the guitar amps sound pretty good, some I don't care for, for example the \"58 tweed B-man\" is supposed to sound like a 59 Fender Bassman. I own a 59 fender bassman and the software amp model doesn't do the original any justice. I did add the fx and bass packs and have not regretted the additional purchase. The bass pack is very useful.\n\nThe amp, cabinet, enclosure, microphone, and fx models do a good job recreating the originals with some exceptions. For $100 dollars and a project studio this software is hard to beat. It has helped me numerous times when I wanted a certain sound for a song and can't spend $$$ for a Marshall jcm 2000, mesa boogie dual rectifier, soldano slo 100, or a plethora of microphones. Also the pre-sets are good. Line 6 did an excellent job of recreating Eddie Van Halen's sound from the early 80's. But you can choose your amp, cainet, enclosure, mic, and fx combo and dial in your own settings specifically tailored to your desires quite easily. I did purchase the expansion Bass and FX packs. The bass cabinets and amps are very nice and the extra effects add quite a bit of room to create.\n\nI use this software on a PC running XP media center. I never had any problems installing, running, or updating the software. The only issue I've ever had with the software was a few years ago. I would plug in to play and all I would get was pure digital distortion every time I strummed my guitar strings. I did some research and discovered that there is a common issue with Guitar Port and my pc xbox 360 game controller working together. For some reason the software from the xbox controller interfered with the software from the guitar port. Before I installed the xbox controller the guitar port worked fine. So I uninstalled the xbox controller and now everything works fine again. This was about two years ago and I haven't looked to see if Line 6 or Microsoft ever resolved the issue, but I leave the game playing to my xbox 360 now and the recording, mixing, and editing to my pc.\n\nI do recommend this product for recording studios. It has helped me achieve sounds that I otherwise would have had to spend thousands of dollars on microphones and amps to achieve.","summary":"Good tool for recording guitar and bass","unixReviewTime":1268006400,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}
{"overall":2,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"01 9, 2010","reviewerID":"A1ARIIDS0IPYLC","asin":"B0000AJQ42","reviewerName":"Jeremy Deats","reviewText":"The short version of this review: If you're a beginner I would not recommend this product. If you're an intermediate player approach with caution. If you're looking for a solid tool for home recording consider buying a nicer virtual instrument plug-in for your DAW or perhaps even a real Pocket POD before this thing. I am very disappointed in this product considering the other options.\n\nGuitarPort is marketed as being both a educational tool as well as professional recording tool, I will review both aspects separately. To use GuitarPort as an educational tool requires a monthly subscription fee to GuitarPort OnLine. The monthly fee is less than ten dollars and for that you get a fixed library of professionally recorded hit tracks from the 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's, etc... For a given track you can download: without bass, without guitar or full mix. You can also download the guitar tab and tone settings. The tone settings will load the appropriate amp model, effects and then set up the amp and effects. You can hit the play and stop buttons and the tab will display on the screen. Sounds great right? Well, it is to a point.... The nice thing here is that you are downloading official tone settings and official tabs licensed by the publisher. The bad thing is that the tab playback software is pretty bad. It's just displaying a PDF on screen and scrolling as the track plays. If you've ever used a program like GuitarPro you will be very very disappointed in the TAB playback. Also the number of songs available is a problem. They aren't really updating their catalog. Lessons are OK at best (if the TAB playback where more like GuitarPro for features then the lessons would be much better, but it isn't). You might as well walk into a local music store and buy a book on playing, the lesson selections here (while some are very good) are not organized in a coherent way for a beginner. The product assumes the player knows what an effect box is, what the various settings on an amp does, etc... in short, it's not a beginners tool. Overall I would give this a grade C- as a learning tool. It has potential for intermediate players, but that's about it. There is another big problem with Guitar Port as an educational tool: NO BASS TABS are available through guitar port on-line and if you want the bass amp models and effects you will have to buy them on-line as an software upgrade for about fifty dollars! As a tool for bass guitarist, GuitarPort is useless.\n\nRegarding using GuitarPort for professional recording tool: When it comes to using software to simulate amps, rhythms, etc.. there are a few industry standards that make these sort of products compatible with a wide variety of DAW (digital audio workstation) recording software such as ProTools, Cakewalk, Ableton Live, etc..  the most popular standard is called VST. Line6 recently added GearBox VST as part of GuitarPort software package, so if you're looking to add Line6 POD quality models and effects for direct guitar studio recording, this is an inexpensive solution and really the only area in which Guitar Port shines (p.s. I still perfer the tone quality and features of Amplitube 2 for this sort of thing)\n\nOverall the GuitarPort a bit of a novelty product, it's not the amp models or effects are bad, it's just for about fifty dollars more you can pick up a PocketPOD and have all these great tones in a little battery powered, hand held device. You even hook the PocketPOD up to a PC using a USB cable and download the free software from Line6 to do almost everything you can with GuitarPort. I see a lot of positive reviews for this thing, so it seems it has made many people happy, but your money can be spent better elsewhere and if you are a beginner stay far away!\n\nOnly two stars for lack of coherence for the education\/training this thing provides. GuitarPort on-line offers too little for what you get and absolutely zero bass guitar material in terms of tabs and lessons. Bass amp models (and a good number of PODxt models) require add on purchase here. You could easily spend $150 on add-ons before making the GuitarPort a viable studio VST instrument. Overall a decent product ideally that has been very very poorly executed.","summary":"Overall a very niche product....","unixReviewTime":1262995200,"vote":4.0,"style":null,"image":null}

Strong, durable, designed almost to military spec, as per the history of the Shure company.  Bono recorded music with this mic, for a reason.  It's not going to pick up your pet house farting or the car driving past outside, but that's exactly why this is a good thing.  It boosts a fragile human voice into a strong one, if they make use of the proximity effect as a benefit, rather than a detriment, which is probably why Bono liked it, but since it's dynamic, you can get away with capturing sound in environments where a condenser mic would require sound proofing and special vibration isolating mic stands.  If you want to sound great over a PC in a noisy bar, on a noisy stage full of musicians, the proximity effect and cardioid pattern of this mic will make that happen, and it will do the same for getting a good recording in a room that isn't soundproof, with traffic outside, etc.  Is it the mic that's going to capture the sound of a spit bubble popping in your mouth or your sister's pet mouse farting? No.  Do you want it to be?  No.","summary":"but that's exactly why this is a good thing. It boosts a fragile human voice into ...","unixReviewTime":1483920000,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

It never really sounded all that good to begin with (a bit less clear, more muffled than a SM 58) but it's always had a place in my gear box as a backup. I've used it on vocals and acoustic guitar, banjo and a cabinet or two, and it worked fine for all those things. Not amazing, but ok.\n\nIf you're looking for a good, cheap SM 58 style mic, I'd go with the Behringer 5800. Great mic, sounds really good, costs like twenty bucks. Still not as good as a Shure SM, but you can get four or five for the same price, and I've used those for years as well with pretty good luck, especially on vocals.

For the price, this is a solid workhorse with multiple applications.\n\nLikes:\n- Sound.  See shure's youtube video comparing the PG, SM, and SM Beta lines.  For the price, this mic compares very favorably.\n- Versatility.  Handles high sound pressure (SPL) with grace, which means you can mic your loud guitar cabinet.  Also does well at lower volumes with your preamp gain cranked up.  If you need more sensitivity, go with a condenser mic.\n- Solid construction.  Built like a more expensive mic.  Takes a beating and still sounds great.\n- Price.  Just fantastic value.\n- Response curve.  Fairly flat with 10 db drop-off from 200 to 50 hz.  Can be used to mic almost anything with a bit of eq tweaking.\n\nOther thoughts:\n- I also like the even-more-affordable PG48, especially for a cheap bass guitar cabinet mic.  It's frequency response drops off a little later (losing 10db from 100hz to 50hz instead of starting higher at 200hz).\n\nOverall, for the price, I believe you can get amazing effects with this PG mic and a decent preamp.","summary":"Versatile, sounds great, affordable.","unixReviewTime":1421884800,"vote":null,"style":{"style:":" PG58XLR"},"image":null}

This is considered the gold standard by which all others are measured. Of course at least part of this reputation is deserved, but perhaps more for the durability of the SM58 than its sound. I have a couple of SM58s and a couple of PG58s. I was considering the SM48, but the PG58 has slightly better specs, and almost identical price.\n\nThe first thing I noticed out of the box was that the PG58 is slightly bigger and slightly heavier. It also has a different switch than the SM58. The metal screens protecting them aren't interchangeable. I then plugged in one microphone cable so the settings would be identical. I tried both mikes, one after the other, first with speaking and then with singing and playing guitar, and then I changed the settings, or more specifically, the effects and the EQ on the PA. I repeated the experiment, speaking and then singing while changing between mikes.\n\nHere's what I noticed: The SM58 is slightly flatter in the mid range. The PG58 is slightly brighter and has a touch more presence. They are about equal on volume. The slight differences in tone can be easily manipulated with an EQ or just ordinary tone controls. Neither was susceptible to much feedback or vocal pop.\n\nI haven't tried out this side by side comparison in a live situation or even in practice, as it's too time consuming and interferes with playing. It's difficulty to judge in those situations too, or at least awkward, but I have used a combination of the two in practice and no one seems to be able to tell the difference, except one person actually expressed a preference for the PG58, but that could be just the settings.\n\nI looked at the specs for the two mikes side by side. The SM58 is a little flatter in response, especially at the high end, over 10K Hz, and it picks up a few dB before the PG 58, somewhere between 50 and 60 Hz. However, since the human vocal range is generally between around 300 and 3000 Hz, neither of these seems likely to have much effect, although the SM58 might be a tad more responsive for a bass singer.\n\nI also tried out two different Behringer mikes and a Radio Shack mike. The Behringer 8500 was totally outclassed by both of the Shures, sounding tinny and thin and with little presence or volume. I tried out a Behringer 2000XM and was impressed by the similarity. These mikes sound almost identical (The B 2000 and the Shure SM). The Behringer 2000XM seems to have been discontinued, though, and replaced with the 1800XM, an inferior mike offered in bundles of three for under $50.\n\nI then plugged in a Radio Shack mike that was a spare backup, not even taken out for practice. The model number is 33-3001, probably also discontinued. This was an excellent sounding mike, with good volume, presence and tone.\n\nI didn't have any other mikes to test in this side by side experiment, but I did reach some conclusions:\nThere is quite a bit of snobbery in choosing microphones, with the Shure SM58 held up as some unreachable standard. They ARE sturdy, and they are good mikes and the price is not unreasonable, at around $100. However, there are other microphones which sound nearly identical and are also sturdy and reliable, at lower prices, including the Shure PG58, and most likely the SM48, though I didn't have any of those to test.\n\nI wish more people would give unbiased reviews based on actual performance instead of condescension toward those who are either on a budget or looking for alternatives to the standard bearer. I'm giving this 4 stars only because I haven't had enough time to give an evaluation of how this holds up in comparison to the SM58.","summary":"Unbiased review","unixReviewTime":1401062400,"vote":11.0,"style":{"style:":" PG58-LC"},"image":null}

I figured I could try this one out, and if it didn't fit the bill I could always just keep it as a backup.\n\nIt comes with an included Shure clip and the extra goodies like a bag. It wired it all up and plugged it into my interface, and it blew me away! The sound is just awesome, and works great with my tenor voice. I threw on some modest reverb and it sounded golden.\n\nThe windscreen is good for now, but I definitely see myself picking up a cheap screen here on Amazon in the next couple months. I tried out whistling into it (you know, for scientific purposes) and when I got up close the screen wasn't good enough to stop the blowiness. Stupid test, but the point is the windscreen doesn't stop it all. \"P's\" and \"B's\" were kept at bay for the most part though.\n\nIt's a Shure, whether or not you think their reputation is deserved, it really is a high quality piece of equipment. The thing is rock solid. Durability will be a non-issue for me.\n\nIf you want a solid gigging mic this is great for the price.","summary":"Sweet!","unixReviewTime":1364860800,"vote":null,"style":{"style:":" PG58XLR"},"image":null}

So while I didn't purchase it, it's been in my possession for the last three years, and it's been in use on a fairly consistent basis since.\n\nFirst of all, it is a Shure microphone. While technology is quickly closing the gap between inexpensive and expensive equipment, the one thing I can say about this microphone that I can't say about many (not all) other low-cost dynamic microphones is that it feels solid when it's held. If it falls to the floor I don't have to worry about it being damaged. Any Shure I've ever used has felt the same way.\n\nSecond, it is an entry level microphone. Don't expect the PG48 XLR to perform like Shure's more famous SM57 or SM58. While they may be the same brand, they certainly are not the same microphones. Shure is clear in their product description that the best uses for the PG48 XLR are for public address and karaoke performances. In my experience I've found this description to be accurate.\n\nThird, if you are looking for performance microphones at a low-cost, there are a couple I could easily recommend that, while they aren't Shure, will more than get the job done. As I mentioned previously technology is quickly closing the gap between brands like Shure to brands like Behringer. Since this is a review about the Shure PG48 XLR though, just ask me for my recommendations in the comment section.\n\nThe last thing I'll say is the PG48 XLR is a good entry level microphone regardless of who makes it. Given its proper setting and application it's more than adequate to make public announcements or to sing to a group of 50 or less. In such settings there's no need to go the more expensive route, even within the Shure family. Just don't expect to be able to play in a rock band with it, because it's not that kind of microphone.","summary":"Entry Level. Shure.

I'd probably be all too ready to agree with those who argue that a Neumann or Telefunken mic costing 5 G's simply isn't that much better than a Nady mic costing 10 bucks.  But with respect to the Shure, I'm less sure that the SM58 isn't worth 40% more than the PG58.  Perhaps if you have a sufficiently high-powered and \"clean\" amplifier and have tweaked the EQ settings to favor the frequencies of the human voice, the two mics could be mistaken for one another.  It was my attempts to occasionally use an instrument amplifier as an emergency P.A. that led me to realize the PG58 sounded somewhat muted and dull compared to the SM58.  Switching to the more common, admittedly more expensive mic, gave me just the extra gain I needed along with added crispness and clarity to the voice (at least for announcements).\n\nP.S. I notice that the head of the PG58 is larger than that of the SM58.  Since the rise of the \"digital audio workstation\" (who doesn't have a computer with free, included Garage Band on it?), large, even gold-plated, expensive-looking but cheap mics are on display all over the place.  Despite appearances, when it comes to mics, size doesn't matter--except for appearances (directors of high school show bands will dispense those headsets that wrap half-way around the face, knowing that the girls in the front-line think they're cool--they look just like Madonna'a or Janet's headgear). Some of the best mics are tiny, with an opening the size of a pin-hole.","summary":"Shure quality and construction but not quite equal to the SM58","unixReviewTime":1245974400,"vote":8.0,"style":{"style:":" PG58QTR"},"image":null}

This time, I saw 2 sm58's used for about what used singles were going for... top rated (1,000s of five star ratings seller) so I went for that.\nWellll, even if it's not \"too good to be true\" you can get scorched.\nTurns out the two came and were packed so it looked like it was used except... no wear on the mikes (first tip off, mine look like I drove roofing nails with them) plus the knockoffs sounded like junk and I can't hear.\nComparing it to a real Amazon purchased sm58, it was a darn good Chinese copy but the details (and sound) gave them away. You'll find what to look for online in YouTube Videos if you think you've been had.\nSo, my contribution to the accolades for the SM58 is to forget buying on auction sites as many other advise, way way too many SM58 $2.00 Chinese knock off fakes out there to even think about it. Buy it from an authorized retailer like Amazon.\nOh yea, the real Sure sm58 mike, great voice response, picks up and handles voices great, not too touchy about being a bit off center and rejected background noise very well.

I'm no vocalist but occasionally need to do announcements or accommodate a guest vocalist through an instrument amp (rather than a P.A.). Whatever the reason, the PG-58 simply doesn't have sufficient gain or oomph to be of much use with the Roland Cube \/ Peavey amps I try to employ it with (I use a 1\/4\" adapter with the XLR connector that comes with the mic).  When I borrow a Shure SM-58 mic from someone, the difference is instant and dramatic--it's a far more efficient (i.e. louder) mic, producing a full, clear sound, and without additional pre-amplification, demonstrating why it's the most popular microphone in the world.  For five bucks extra, I can't fathom a reason for avoiding the SM-58S, the version with an on-off switch.  It's a small price to pay for quick solutions to feedback or the unwanted pick-up of \"private\" comments by indiscreet band members.  And even if you're an instrumentalist, it may be wiser to select the SM-58 over the SM-57.  The former mic is a little more ostentatious, but it's also slightly more adaptable, and the screen can filter out a certain amount of wind noise and unwanted non-musical sounds. Above all, the SM-58 has proven itself to be the Sherman tank of microphones, simply unparalleled for ruggedness and durability.\n\n[I see a review cautioning the consumer to be wary of \"this seller.\"  Perhaps a good point unless it's in reference to Amazon Prime, which is the Shure SM-58 of commerce: competitive prices, no postage, easy returns.  But anyone who returns an SM58 probably had no business buying it in the first place.  They are the populous drones of the industry, invariably purchased by professionals who know first-hand what they're getting--reliability and virtual indestructibility.  In fact, it's the very popularity of the SM58 that has led to all of the slightly less or more expensive imitators.  Consumers require choice, but with the Shure SM58 there need be none.]","summary":"A Shure Bet.","unixReviewTime":1245110400,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

Vasser","reviewText":"Although this mic is now considered primarily an instrument mic, that was not always the case and I've actually preferred this same basic design for live vocal use since 1970 when I bought my first one which was then known as a \"Shure Model 545 Unidyne III.\"  That mic got stolen about 2 years ago, but remarkably was still working at the time it got boosted and I was still using it when I needed one with an on\/off switch function.  I've owned or used countless modern day SM-58's and SM-57's along with dozens of other mics over the years from all manufacturers.  I have a fairly deep baritone to bass type voice and I don't need to get closer than about 7 or 8 inches to a SM-57.  To me the SM-57 sounds similar to the $469 Shure SM-7 studio vocal mic if you put a windscreen on it and get about 2 inches away.  I'd only use an SM-7 in a studio environment though because they are slightly more fragile and over four times as expensive.  By design the SM-58's require you to get much closer to the mic to get a full range sound than with the SM-57's.  I prefer the SM-57's over the SM-58's for vocal use because they sound crisper on the highs and they sound fuller on the low end.  The SM-57 sounds more natural on vocals and never sounds muddy or muffled.  The SM-57 has one of the most pronounced proximity effects of any mic I've ever used.  If you tend to shove the mic down your throat you may benefit from the less dramatic proximity effect of the SM-58.  If you are ever going to use an SM-57 for vocals I'd recommend buying the Shure A2WS windscreen with it.  That genuine Shure windscreen fits precisely and locks securely onto the SM-57.  The SM-57 will pop like mad without one.  The only possible drawback to the SM57 as a vocal mic is that there is no model available with an on\/off switch these days.  I can't find a modern SM-57 with a switch anywhere.  However, if you've ever tried using a mic when you forgot that the switch was in the off position it probably just became a liability. For my money, the SM-57 is the best all around microphone of the past two generations for stage use and some recording purposes.  For studio vocals I'd use an SM-7, which really doesn't sound all that much different from the SM-57 when the built-in variable EQ on the SM-7 is set the way I like.  The SM-57 and it's predecessors are to me the best all around microphone since 1970 and certainly the most enduring and durable.  You can not go wrong unless you get too close with no windscreen.","summary":"Best all around for over 30 years!","unixReviewTime":1147651200,"vote":100.0,"style":{"style:":" Without cable"},"image":null}

One dead giveaway is the weight, the fake was around 2 0z less and where the mic screws together there is a noticeable gap in a real sm. Not so with the fake it is a very tight closing gap.  I hate to admit it but the fake is not that bad especially for vocals, it doesn't compare with a real one though for instrument recording.  The fake is a more direct counterfeit of a sm 58  imo.  I think it was designed for karaoke from what I've read so it makes sense.","summary":"Excellente!!","unixReviewTime":1480809600,"vote":3.0,"style":{"style:":" Without cable"},"image":null}

After a lot of research and emails with his band conductor we settled on the Shure SM57-X2U.  It was right in our price range, but didn't scrimp on quality of sound.  The bundle we purchased included a table top stand, cover and cables - a great package for the money!  As many musicians (and their parents) know, quality of the final product is most important and we are impressed.  He immediately started using it for auditions, online postings, and school work and we have been surprised at how well it records.  It is very user friendly and very durable (we all know how hard teenagers can be on things).  The mic also has its own carrying bag which makes it safe during transport to a variety of locations.

I would always have to tweak the amp or the actual recording to get a decent sound and remove some of the unwanted tone.  When the Shure SM57 arrived I set it up and adjusted my amp back to how I like it. After the first recording I was thrilled. The recording actually sounded like the sound coming from the amp. The mic only picks up the perfect tones while leaving the garbage behind. After moving the mic around a bit I actually have a near professional quality.

Everything comes through loud and clear and so natural sounding. I play sitting on a stage stool with the mic a few inches in front of my strings, pointing at my face.

Johnson","reviewText":"Both the Shure SM57 and SM58 microphones (which, by the way, are the same on the inside) are considered industry workhorses. You see these things pop up everywhere, from studios to live gigs to concerts on TV. They are everywhere. Which I find a bit strange because, frankly, they aren't that good.\n\nThe design of these mics goes back about 40 years. But a lot has happened with microphone technology during that time. These models may have been very good decades ago, but they are really showing their age. The most prominent problem with them is the sound quality... they are quite \"honky,\" making vocalists sound much more nasal than they really are. There are some situations where that might be okay (such as miking a guitar cabinet that lacks upper mid-range), but these models do not make good vocal mics.\n\nIn a shootout in my studio with more than 20 different models of mics, the SM57\/58 were near the bottom of the list. Virtually every other microphone we tested sounded better. And I'm not talking about comparing it to $3500 Neumann U87 mics either... more than half of the mics we used were under $150. Other, better choices in a similar price range are the AKG D5, Heil Sound PR 22, or stepping up to the Shure Beta 57, which is much, much better. And all of which have better off-axis rejection and higher gain before feedback.\n\nI know that nearly everyone uses these mics, but that doesn't actually mean they are that good. There are much better choices for your money.\n\nOn the plus side, both the SM57 and SM58 are nearly bullet-proof. You can really abuse them and they'll sound just like they did when they were brand-new.","summary":"Seriously overrated","unixReviewTime":1351900800,"vote":8.0,"style":{"style:":" Without cable"},"image":null}

I've been using it for decades.  (The Neuman KMS 105 might sound a bit better, at 6 times the price.  Then again, it might not!)  And the 57 is a surprisingly good performer for vocals in the studio.  I like my large diaphragm condensers for some things, but when I want to wail, the 57 is still among the best I've found.  Maybe THE best.  The special Shure A2Ws windscreen is the reason for my new appreciation of the 57.  With the windscreen in place, breath noise and plosives are gone (unless I get really sloppy).  I a\/b'd the 57 with the windscreen against a Shure SM58.  The 58's a great mic, but the 57 sounds more open in the top end (as other reviewers have noted.)  Generic windscreens don't sound as good with this mic.  They tend to be too thick and dense, blocking a lot of the high frequencies.  Spend the $15 and get the A2WS.  It has a set screw that enables you to lock the screen in place, leaving a small air space between the foam and the mic's grill.  Gives it a nice, open, airy sound.  The 57's not a high output mic, so you'll need a bit more gain in the preamp compared to some mics, but that's a very minor drawback.\n\nFor mic-ing guitar amp cabinets, this is an industry standard.  Also good for snares, toms, even kick drums.  (Take the windscreen off for these applications, of course.)  It's probably the most versatile microphone ever made.  At around $100, there is no better bargain.","summary":"Impressive Vocal Mic on Stage, AND in the Studio","unixReviewTime":1299974400,"vote":22.0,"style":{"style:":" Without cable"},"image":null}

I have miked everything from drums, guitars, vocals to woodblocks and even drills\/power tools. These mics are fantastic for a closed mic sound as they reject a lot of background noise (so they also work great for playing live). This means they are absolutely fantastic for drums - it's very easy to record multiple tracks with minimal \"bleeding\" coming through on other tracks. I mic all of my drums with these, except I use a Beta 52 for my bass drum, and currently I use lower-end overheads (these are the weak link in my setup). The SM57s aren't fantastic for cymbals.\n\nI love how these mics give me a good clean base recording. Using my favorite DAW (Reaper) I can easily liven the sound up with my own reverbs and such. The SM57s will give you a great image; you just apply your own colors.\n\nI absolutely love hooking these up to my PA and playing live - since they reject much of the background noise, I can crank my PA up loud and it sounds very clear. Also, these are fairly good at rejecting feedback. When I mic my Marshall amp the guitar comes through incredibly loud and clear. You can certainly find a better mic for vocals (these are a little flat-ish and your singer really needs to belt it to get the most out of these), but for general purpose these work great.\n\nHere are the various instruments I have miked, and my opinion on how well these work\nDrums, Toms (great!)\nDrums, Snare (very good)\nDrums, Cymbals (below par)\nDrums, Kick (not bad)\nGuitar, Electric (great!)\nGuitar, Acoustic (good)\nBass Guitar (okay)\nCajon (good)\nBongos (very good)\nVarious Hand Drums (good)\nWood Block (very good)\nIndustrial Sounds, for example: power tools (very good)\nVocals (good)\n\nThese mics are a great choice for many applications. They don't shine in every scenario of course, but generally speaking you can't go wrong. Also, these are built like a tank, and if something does go wrong (busted grill for instance), the replacement parts are easy to find.\n\nThese mics are the staple in my home studio.

So I was going to get one of each but decided to try the WHLB first.\n\nAfter putting several hours into practicing scratching and many more hours ripping and remastering my vinyl,  I'm pretty happy.  It sounds amazing and I'm not having any issues with jumping or skipping.\n\nI've read on other sites that the screw for setting the overhang is a soft tinned metal,  so take care not to over tighten it, I hear they are hard to find(?)  I would think any parts store tho would have something that would work.  Doesn't take much force to hold in place, I just snug it and I don't tighten it.  I've also read that they are fragile(?), but I have no experience with anything breaking, I've only had it a couple weeks.  Not sure what part of it would break tho due to any design flaw that I can see.\n\n[edit]\nThere's a Toolkit that comes with it, consisting of a stylus brush and a screwdriver for setting the overhang... the brush is ok but the screwdriver is not good, it doesn't fit the head of the screw properly.  You'll likely damage your screw if you use this thing, it will cam out and mangle.  I just compared my tips with the one they sent, the Shure driver is unmarked but it's actually a #00 and the screw itself is a #1.  Hope this helps someone!\n[endedit]\n\nIt looks awesome!

{"overall":5,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"08 4, 2016","reviewerID":"ADH0O8UVJOT10","asin":"B0000WS0SC","reviewerName":"StormJH1","reviewText":"This review is for the microKORG XL+, which is not the original microKORG released around 2001 or the updated XL released in 2008.  The microKORG XL+ came out in 2012, and is basically a further expansion on the virtual analog (\"VA\") modeling engine used in the XL, plus some additional PCM samples (for example, there is a traditional piano sound and an M1 organ now available).\n\nBUILD QUALITY - The marketing of the \"XL\" and \"XL+\" is a bit confusing because I am pretty sure that both models are actually lighter, smaller, and have fewer knobs and buttons than the original microKORG (while generally going for the same price or possibly a little more).  The build quality and choice of materials is probably the poorest aspect of the XL+.  Considering that this is a product intended to retail for around $500, and comparing that to what is offered by the new Korg Minilogue and comparably priced (but functionally very different) products from Arturia and Novation, the plastic housing, plastic jacks, and semi-suspect knobs are a bit of a disappointment.  To be honest, if I were any kind of serious musician that needed to play this synth live (or even take it out of my house), I probably couldn't give it a 5-star review.  But I think that it's a device that should work and continue to work for many years in a home studio setting, and with reasonable care and use.\n\nAt the same time, Korg's design choices have other advantages which become more obvious once you own and use the device for awhile.  This thing is LIGHT - weighing in at only a few pounds, it's fully capable of being played on your lap comfortably (I actually played it in my car a bit the other day just because I can).  This thing is also extremely PORTABLE - not many synths with this kind of firepower can run for about 4 hours on 6 AA batteries.  You can power it with Korg's KA350 9V adapter (which, unfortunately, is center-positive and a bit of a non-standard barrel size), but I'm thinking I'm just as likely to throw a set of Eneloop rechargeables in there, and it will encourage me to use it all the often.  So, yes, the XL+ doesn't necessarily \"feel\" like a professional device, but at least on my unit, everything works reliably, and owning this synth begs the question about so many other mini-synths on the market: What, really, is the point of making synths smaller if they are still heavy, clumsy, and anchored to a wall adapter.  The XL+ is none of those things, and is all the better for it.\n\nINTERFACE & PROGRAMMING - The microKORG XL+ has 37 mini keys, and a 3-octave range (with additional octave up and down switch, of course).  Keyboards are very subjective and I find that even if you prefer a firmer or looser action on keys, your opinion may differ depending on the type of playing you are doing.  For example, I find that the firmer approach of something like Arturia MicroBrute is better for percussive monophonic sequences or \"finger drumming\", whereas the microKORG XL+ requires a much lighter touch to press the keys.  While the real estate is a bit tight and the looseness takes a little getting used to, I find it more piano-like and sensitive to subtle velocity differences than many other cheap synth and MIDI controller keyboards I have used.  I actually think I might prefer this as a pure \"keyboard\" over my CME XKey 37, which is full-size but has very non-traditional \"button\" keys.\n\nIt seems impossible that a synth with as few knobs and buttons as the XL+ has could have much depth, but here again Korg made some very intelligent and beginner-friendly design choices.  For example, there are only 3 parameter control knobs, but a 4th knob selects different editing \"banks\", and these are universal to all of your presets\/programs.  They are also clearly labeled on the dashboard, so I was able to figure out how to tweak the release time or modify the filter without even checking the manual.  In fact, while there is a LCD screen, the XL+ is careful not to over-rely on it.  You'll only really find yourself scrolling through text options on the screen if you are changing to a different effect, or making deeper parameter edits.\n\nOne thing the XL+ probably could have used was a button selector for quick switching between presets.  I really have no idea how you would use this thing live if you needed to change to a different preset mid-song.  The MiniNova and even some other Korg products use a button bank that is much easier to navigate on the fly.\n\nSOUNDS & VERSATILITY - The XL+ is a very preset-based machine, which is both good and bad.  There are two schools of thought when it comes to beginners and synths.  The first school says that every important function should get its own knob, and that you should just have a wall of choices in front of you as you learn the basics of synthesis and tweak them on a dashboard.  The second school of thought (and one that I am coming around to) is that \"more is not always better\" and that by having too many variables, you can actually frustrate and overwhelm people who just want to grab a device and make music.  The XL+ has MASSIVE power, but much of it is baked into the presets that you swap in and out and create using the computer editor.  On the PC editor, you can do things like access Korg's library of programs based on VA subtractive synthesis or PCM samples.  I'm totally blown away by how varied the sounds are in the XL+.  Combined with 8-note polyphony, it's capable deep sub basses, haunting pads, chiptune leads, and warm vintage analog poly chords.\n\nBut probably my favorite aspect of the XL+ is how useful it is in my workflow.  The on-board sounds are great on their own, but the XL+ is also an outstanding (and very portable) MIDI controller.  It even supplies MIDI power, so I can use it with a sound module like the Ploytec PL2, or even power the Retrokits RK002 Midiator cable designed for the Volca Sample and Volca FM.  It has a headphone jack (1\/4\") and two 1\/4\" outputs for a mixer, computer interface, or recording device.  There is also an input jack so you can apply external sounds to Korg's excellent filters and effects.\n\nI'm relatively new to hardware synthesizers, but even in my limited experience with other budget\/compact gear, the microKORG XL+ really stands out.  The wildly popular Arturia MicroBrute and MiniBrute are great devices, but they're also monosynths and far more limited in scope than the XL+.  I own basically all of the Korg Volca series, and while those are great devices, I feel like the microKORG XL+ covers about 90-95% of the sounds I could conceivably make with the Volca Bass, Keys, and FM combined.  Not to mention that it comes with a 37-key keyboard that you can actually play, that can be powered by battery, and that you can effectively use as a MIDI keyboard with some of your other devices.  The microKORG XL+ isn't the newest or sexiest toy on block, but remains an example of \"digital done right\".  It's capable of playing hundreds of different sounds from some of Korg's best products of the past 20 years, and allowing the user to tweak them even further with a simple layout of knobs on the device.  I think it could be the integral component to a budget home studio, especially combined with a good drum machine and mono synth for bass\/lead work.","summary":"microKORG XL+: Less on the dashboard; considerably more under the hood","unixReviewTime":1470268800,"vote":7.0,"style":{"Style:":" microKORG XL +"},"image":null}

I can see the complaints for the sounds being listed as different genres (no death metal polka?), but that really means nothing in the scheme of things. If anything it will have you going to certain ones (retro) more often cause of the sounds there (retro), though I don't have any favorites cause I love (retro) all my kids (retro) the same.\n\nmoving around to adjust the sound can be a little tricky at first, the sounds out of the box are pretty much what you are looking for, then using the 4 knob classic control (sustain\/decay, attack, filter, cutoff) is usually enough, but we all want more kontrol, and you get that with this. this is a perfect price as well, being just enough that you know you're getting quality, and not so steep that it's not affordable.\n\nback to the device, the sounds are as analogee as you could hope for, the tones when dropped an octave, are so thick, dense and awesome, that it is just amazing. there are some really nice sounds out of the box that are impressive, with a couple that are surprising and enjoyable, like a whistle kind of sound and other chirpy sounds that are, as my sister and I say...the future, as imagined in 1972!!!! that said, this thing will probably be what most people looking to make their own electronic music, indie\/diy stuff, and anything in between. I am a big fan of tangerine dream, the blade runner soundtrack, as well as other vangelis albums, so there is some stuff in here that gets me to where I want to go. I just got it, but the more I tinker, the more I am happy with what sounds and tones I find.\n\nI wanted to end this on the controversy of the mini-keys. I at first didn't mind the idea, seeing as how, as they say in videos \"you use one hand on the keys, the other one twiddling knobs\". then as I actually got it and started playing, I realized something better that I haven't seen mentioned yet, though I didn't read all the reviews here, but it's safe to say NO ONE ELSE HAS SAID THIS, so gather round, make some s'mores, get your camo-snuggie on. the smaller keys works wonders for playing EXTENDED chords, so, to try to be clear and helpful, you start on one key, then, say, the next key you hit is 3 away from that one, usually chords only go like another 2 or 3 keys from that one, these little keys let you really stretch and easily make up chords that wouldn't be possible on a full sized keyboard, or if they did, you would have to use both hands, or overdub. does that make sense? trick question, it does, press rewind if I haven't...well you get it.\n\nso the smaller keys actually is awesome, especially for electronic forms of music, where the chords used can be stranger than regular chords played on the piano. once I figured that out, this device became something more special than it already was.\n\nwhat? what's that? vocoder? yeah, it's awesome. don't want to call it novelty, but it would be something tough to use all the time, especially recording and having every song with it on there, but it's here, it works, and it works well. will use more in time, for sure, will probably write whole songs with it, lol.\n\nI got the vintage gold, which is the winner hands down! but this model has the most reviews, so I wanted to be included in this one. I have an inexpensive keyboard that has more \"normal\" sounds. this, with a keyboard with a HALF DECENT piano sound, and you can do something special. that with my guitar, bass, drum machine, sp-303 that I never use, and digitech jamman solo, and my effects pedals is enough to do some beautiful things.","summary":"not much to complain about","unixReviewTime":1400371200,"vote":3.0,"style":{"style:":" microKORG"},"image":null}

But then, I don't like piano keys; they're like using a sledge hammer to drive a thumbtack. I have some full-size keyboards and I can't play those monster keys as deftly as I can play the short-travel minis on the MK. And if you want big keys, just midi any big keyboard to the MK. Problem solved.\n\nWell, that just about wraps up the complaint department.\n\nThe MK is a lap-size portable with the sonic power of a room full of vintage equipment. There are other synths in its size and price range but I don't think they sound better (personal preference) and they're not as easy to program. If I could have only one synth it would be a Microkorg.\n\nIn 2012, just to see if I could, I did everything on the MK. You can hear all my 2012 tunes at aejotz.com. Some of the sounds are presets, some are tweaked presets, some are patches I found online and some I programmed from scratch. I used no effects and the only non-MK sound you'll hear is the metronome click from my recorder, which I decided to leave on a couple of tracks. Long story short, I really put that \"toy\" through its paces.\n\n(The tracks from 1983 are all Casio MT-65. The tracks from 2011 and 2013 can be any mixture of Microkorg, Casio CZ-101, Alesis Micron, Arturia Minibrute, Yamaha PSR-520 and a few other gadgets.)","summary":"Best Toy Ever?","unixReviewTime":1363651200,"vote":null,"style":{"style:":" microKORG"},"image":null}

That said, the 128 presets that it ships with are pretty decent to get you started, but PLEASE refrain from using them in your recordings\/performances without doing a decent amount of tweaking and effecting. The mK seems to have a very unique sonic footprint, and since so many people own this synth, using the presets as-is is definitely going to be frowned upon. Of course this can be said about any synth, but especially for the microKORG. There's nothing quite as anticlimactic as seeing a band perform live using the mK and you recognize they're using factory preset A43. True story. The built-in delay\/ensemble effects are great, but I think the mK sounds 1000x better when ran through some outboard effects. If I want a sick and meaty low-end bass that easily lends itself to (gag) dubstep or drum & bass, I'll run the mono output of the Korg to an&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Electro-Harmonix-Bass-Big-Muff-Distortion-Pedal\/dp\/B001C1A6CI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Electro-Harmonix Bass Big Muff Distortion Pedal<\/a>&nbsp;and then directly to the board or to a bass amp. It's pretty filthy.\n\nEditing\nEditing and tweaking your own patches is easy enough via the seven knobs and 3 character LED screen, but it tends to be a time-consuming process, especially since there's no visual feedback of your tweaks. If membrane style programming isn't your bag, then you should definitely download the free microKORG Patch Editor, however since the mK lacks USB connectivity, I suggest the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/M-Audio-USB-Midisport-Uno-MIDI-Interface\/dp\/B00007JRBM\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">M-Audio USB Midisport Uno MIDI Interface<\/a>. Both the MIDI implementation and the editor are a tad wonky, but you will be able to visually access and edit all of the synth's parameters. Adding to the USB\/MIDI functionality, once you've made your connection, you can also sequence the mK from your workstation (Ableton, FL Studio, Sonar, etc.) via MIDI out. This of course, opens up a whole new world of possibilities and will really let you unleash the power of the microKORG. Finally, since the synth engine is same one used in the Korg MS-2000, you can import MS-2000 patches into the mK by means of sysex files. You'll need a MIDI utility such as MIDI OX, and from there, it's gets a little complicated, but if you're a true synth-geek and you want your microKORG to sound like an MS-2000, it might be worth it.\n\nVocoder\nTruth be told, this was a key factor in my decision to purchase the mK as I wanted it for live vocoding. Software\/VST vocoders are great, but they tend to be process hogs, especially in live situations, so for this reason alone, I insisted on the hardware route. Upon setup, the first thing you need to do is replace the freebie gooseneck microphone that it ships with. A lot of the reviews that I've read say that the mK's vocoder sucks, which if you use the gooseneck, I somewhat agree with, however after popping in an inexpensive dynamic mic, the quality difference is absolutely amazing. Also, depending on your intentions, the supplied vocoder patches are pretty lame, so you will definitely want to create your own, either manually or with the software editor, especially if you're going for the traditional robot\/Cylon effect. On a final, yet critical note, since the mK only boasts an 8 band vocoder, I strongly suggest running the output through an EQ to enhance the mids and highs.\n\nBuild\/Layout\nUnless you're one of those types who regularly abuses your equipment, the mK is built solid enough for stage use, but then again, I'm also the type that tends to baby my gear. Right out of the box, the faux wood side-panels felt a tad loose, which made it feel a little flimsy, but after a few turns with the screwdriver, they were nice and tight and it definitely felt more solid. I've also noticed that a lot of people seem to complain about the keys, either their size or feel. I do admit that they do take a little getting used to, but unless you're recreating Flight of the Bumblebee, you should be able to manage just fine, even with stubby little sausage fingers. Naturally, if worse comes to worse, you can always connect a full size MIDI controller and use the mK as a stand-alone sound module. As far as running via battery power, the concept is pretty cool, but be warned, they do drain pretty quickly and will give you a little over an hour of playing and tweaking. I've never been the type to rely on battery power, especially for outboard gear or effect pedals, so I would suggest sticking with the wall-wart. Lastly, don't be fooled by the bank names on the Program Select panel because they really don't do any justice for the mK. I'm sure \"Trance\", \"Techno\/House\", \"Electronica\", etc. were used for marketing purposes by satisfying the instant gratification factor for that out-of-box experience.\n\nIn Summation\nIf you have one, keep it 'n tweak it, and if you're on the fence about getting one; get it! I know there are literally thousands of VSTi plugins that that have more bells and whistles in one oscillator than the mK has in total, but for the price, you get a lot of bang for your buck, plus a cool piece of hardware. I'm not saying that it's an all-in-one or everyday synth, but it's definitely a cool piece of kit to have in your arsenal. Lastly, if you're looking for an easy talkbox solution (a la Roger Troutman), I suggest pairing your microKORG with a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Rocktron-Banshee-2\/dp\/B0014Z37H8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Rocktron Banshee 2<\/a>.","summary":"The Mini-Keyed Beast","unixReviewTime":1362528000,"vote":7.0,"style":{"style:":" microKORG"},"image":null}

I have played around with it quite a bit and find the sound amazing.  It's most obvious flaw (small keys with only three octaves) can easily be solved.  We have a cheap, old Casio with full size keys and six octaves.  I just ran a MIDI cable out from the Casio into the Microkorg and, voila, you can play the Casio and hear the Microkorg.  Of course, I also had to buy a dual mount stand (which looks really cool), but it improved the usefulness of the Microkorg threefold.  Also, each voice on the Casio creates a new sounds with each voice on the Microkorg.  If you have the Casio volume down all the way, you can't hear its output; or, you can run a cable into the amp and hear both the actual sound of the Casio voice PLUS the Casio\/Microkorg voice PLUS the Microkorg voice by itself (if you reach up and hit those keys).  Needless to say, this creates millions(?) of possible sounds.

It is built in Vietnam, but don't let that fool you.  It feels pretty tight and no internal buzzing that I was aware of the cabinet area. There may be some built in modeling of which is not disclosed.  It has that British Jangly distorted tone on the 2nd channel.  On  the clean channel,  using the gain upwards of 3\/4 will give you the introduction of some distorted tones and mimicking a valve type amp.  I was overall impressed with how nice it does sound, so much so that I may get second one for another room, perhaps the red special edition at the same price or the version with the British flag in white.\n\nThe only negative was the lack of a reverb.  Even if they would have added a digital modeled reverb, it would have been a great add on, but this bare bones amp is probably light years ahead of the amp I started on with which was a small Transistor Sears amp in the mid to late 70's..\n\nAs far as recording goes, using an external Mic would be no problem.  Understand that the smaller an amp is, the close proximity of a Microphone will make it sound larger.  It's only in open air and further away that the sound of the smaller speaker will show it's tininess.  If you have this amp at or near ear level or pointed up towards you at about 4-5 feet away, it sounds like a larger amp.  Regardless, I was impressed.  Great value and I would say it's above a practice amp.

Reynolds","reviewText":"This is a quick review - I hope to update this review later. Started looking at amps and was blown away by the sound of a VOX AC4TV (clean\/warm tone). Almost ready to buy it, but then decided to see what else was out there. Began seriously considering the Fender Mustang series. Only problem is I really didn't want to keep toying with the computer to achieve the sound I knew I wanted - and I do like to tinker with settings. I also couldn't justify the great expense at this time (I think the mustang is shackled until you get the III with the interface). Kept digging a little more. How can I get the rich VOX sound I wanted? I also knew I just had to have a 12 inch speaker.. right? Wrong. My venue 99.9% of the time right now is my living room and bed room. I realized I would not be able to fully appreciate a 12 inch speaker until properly driven with 20-40 watts. I already knew the pawn shop 15w peavey rage I had could get really loud ... did I need really loud? Would that increase my amount of practice time? No - going back and reassessing... I wanted that VOX tone. Ok - but I had the VOX stomplab (see my other review... also soon to be updated), and it could make the VOX series of sounds... really nice through good headphones - I guess ok in the Peavey. Still fighting back discontent - what was it I was looking for??? Simplicity, tone, and price (and no concern for tube maintenance) - not necessarily in that order.\n\nI found the Pathfinder at a local shop (not my local GC). I took a couple minutes with the display model to see if I was achieving the warmth I was looking for. It took less time than I figured to decided that at this price, I would be satisfied. Did I side by side test the pathfinder with the mustang? not yet. Maybe I will one day.\n\nWhat am I doing more of than before with the Pathfinder? Practicing\/playing.\n\nMy current setup is an Epiphone SG Pro with a VOX Stomplab IIG and now the Pathfinder.\nThe pathfinder adds enough of the warm VOX tone I was looking for with all knobs set at 12 o'clock and the channel set to clean. I can make adjustments to tone with the SG Pro's volume\/tone knobs and coil tapping. I'm not looking for extreme sounds - so generally I use the Stomplab for some variety of reverb, delay, and\/or chorus AND the pedal is a big plus for master volume control. If I want gain\/overdrive\/distortion - I leave the pathfinder alone. I rely on the stomplab for the gritty sound I want. It has a much better capacity to deliver in that arena.\n\nThis is my poor man's audio chain. The only thing I can improve at this time is my playing. If I am ever lucky enough to gig\/play with others - and if the Pathfinder won't mike well - then I may consider something bigger\/better. For now - big isn't everything for me. The Pathfinder has won me over.\n\nI'm only a couple days into playing with this setup and if I ever get tired of it or it stops working well for this beginner\/intermediate - I will post otherwise.","summary":"Buy this! and the Stomp Lab IIG - perfect mini practice combo","unixReviewTime":1430092800,"vote":null,"style":{"Color:":" Classic"},"image":null}

I read a lot of reviews and did my research and it seemed like this amp would be the best for me. I'm living in a college apartment so I didn't want to go too big and annoy my neighbors. I also didn't have much of a budget for a guitar amp, so I decided to buy low. The package came in a couple of days later and I opened it up and was amazed at the size of this thing! The picture makes it look like an eraser but it's the size of a man's shoebox. The clean channel sounds unbelievably clean. I couldn't help but compare it to my old Ibanez IBZ-10 Tone Blaster Amp which sounded like there was a perpetual colony of bees hiving inside the speaker. The volume gets pretty loud even for its size and it still maintains that clean sound even at 12 gain and 12 volume. The \"overdrive\" setting is cool too. I haven't tinkered with that one too much, but it's fun to play \"Johnny B. Goode\" on.\n\nI didn't want to buy an amp that had all of the shiny bells and whistles that fall off after the first month. I wanted a quality amp for a low price, and I got it. You can always buy pedals to get all those cool sounds, and I plan on doing that too, but you need a good amp with a good clean channel like this one before you start getting into other effects.

I play primarily through an American Deluxe Strat-HSS. My LP is too hot and sounds kind of like hot trash through it.\n\nFirst, what I would not do with this amp - \"gig\" with it. Play it out, play it live or with a drummer. It is a $70 - 10w solid state amp. You have to crank it to do those things and solid state amps just don't sound as good maxed as they do at mid levels. This amp sounds terrible with everything dimed. That doesn't mean you can't...and if your budget is only $70 for your amp, then do what you gotta do.\n\nWhat is has. Gain control & channel, volume, bass and treble. Using the gain channel as a distortion doesn't sound great to me. In fact it sounds like a can of bees. Not the good Cobain kind of bees; the, \"I think your amp is smokng, dude,\" kind of bees.\n\nHowever, using the gain control (not channel) and volume together creates a very full clean sound. Some of my pedals like clean boosts or clean drives don't really do much with the Pathfinder, but they are designed for tube amps and that is understandable (refer to above \"bee\" sounds for a better description). Also, analog delay doesn't sound great, but digital delays and light reverb are cool (of course).\n\nI use it for true bedroom practice. and just wanted something that I could run my pedal board into that had a little character. We also have had a Roland Microcube in the house, but it is very sterile sounding. The Vox actually carries that Vox tone and has a bit of warmth. I've also spent a lot of time on the AC4TV tube amp and that is much better, but also a lot louder and $300.\n\nI do knock of stars for the non existant gain and amps intolerance for effects. For the price, less than a cheap effect pedal or video game with some DLC, this is an awesome value and really good clean practice amp. Again, if you need to practice your Meshuggah riffs, you need to look elsewhere. A tiny bit of reverb and delay sounds really good and for open chording or practicing with your headphones on, this is a great investment.","summary":"My little plastic miracle","unixReviewTime":1373673600,"vote":23.0,"style":{"Color:":" Classic"},"image":null}

In my experience so far it is easier to extract good sound from drums with individual mics rather than trying to capture multiple items with a single mic.

Note that the current amazon description for PG56-LC omits the fact that an A50D rim mount is included in each PG56-LC package (I have submitted a modification request for the description that corrects this omission).  These rim mounts are just perfect for the PG56s, just mount and forget.

I had the first pair about 2 years when the plastic covering over the foam earcups started to shred and peel off. The sound was pretty good so I bought a new pair. The original phones came with a 1\/4\" male plug and a 1\/8\" adapter. The new ones came with a 1\/8\" plug and a 1\/4\" adapter. The first thing I noticed on the new pair was that the stereo separation was very poor. The left and right channels were pretty close to being the same. I tested the old headphones and the separation was noticeably better. But on the new set it is pretty poor, probably about 75% crossover on both ears. If you don't care that much about stereo channel separation, and are willing to peel off the plastic film off the foam ear cans when it starts shredding off, then this is a decent sounding set of earphone for the money.\nDiscovered a work around for the separation problem. Using the 1\/4\" adapter that came with the set, I then use a 1\/8\" adapter over the 1\/4\" adapter, to bring the jack back to 1\/8\". Using the two adapters on the 1\/8\" plug seems to restore the stereo separation.","summary":"Poor stereo separation, channels overlap, plastic can covers shred and come off.

VERY picky. I (normally) use Beats Studio headphones, Bose package in my car, and Klipsch for my home theater and computer speakers. That being said, I wanted something to use that sounded great and was as comfortable as my Beats Studios but wouldn't break the bank. Obviously the sound quality isn't on-par with the Beats for this price, but it isn't meant to be. The quality is though, plenty sufficient to me. If the speakers produced a bit more low-end these would probably be the perfect pair of headphones. I record music at home and when someone is recording their instrument I'll let them wear the Beats while I wear these. They cancel a bit of noise due to their over-the-ear design, they sound great, and (most importantly?) they are extremely comfortable. I can wear these through hours of recording with no regrets. I also use these to listen to lectures for some online classes that I'm taking if other people are around and I don't want to annoy them by exposing them to second-hand knowledge.\n\nFor the price, these headphones can't be beat. I own probably around 6-8 pairs of decent over-the-ear headphones that range from $20-$300 and these are currently my #2, right behind my Beats. I wear the Beats when I want the best sound reproduction, and I throw these on when I just want something comfortable and don't want to kill the batteries in my Beats.

The coil starts about 18\" down, which is perfect imo because you don't want the coil next to your face.

Vasser","reviewText":"The first rule of microphones is that, \"No one microphone is perfect for every purpose.\"  Rule two is, \"Experiment with different mics in different applications to find your signature sound.\"  I've used Shure SM58's along with their ancestors and relatives back to 1968.  I primarily used them for broadcasting and recording spoken word content but I have used (and still do use) them for singing some back up vocals.\n\nThe SM58 does one thing well and that is vocal performance when used very close to the mouth for public address use.  Some people, me included, actually sound better and more comfortable in a live performance setting when using another mic, the Shure SM-57.  The SM-58 is a very good vocal mic and for some people probably the best choice.  For example, anyone who can not resist putting the mic right up against their lips while singing will probably want the SM-58.  People with softer or weaker voices will want the SM-58.\n\nThe SM-58 is highly directional and has a noticeable yet manageable proximity effect (which means the bass increases the closer you get.)  This mic does not pick up well from much over 8 inches away.  The reason so many singers think you are supposed to shove microphones practically inside your mouth is because the ball type Shure vocal mics require you to get them very close or they don't sound right.  On the other hand, the SM-57 sounds best several inches away from the user's mouth and works fine up to 12 inches away.  While the SM-58 is certainly the number one professional PA vocal mic, there are precious few other uses for it because it has a colored sound with a prominent frequency response boost in the upper midrange plus a sound source has to be very close before it is picked up clearly.  It works ok for conga drums and the like, but the SM-58 is about the last thing you'd want to use to mic a sax or guitar.  Personally these mics are not the best for my mic technique or the basic nature my voice, but for some people they sound great.  The live vocal mic that works best for me is the Shure SM-57 with a windscreen.  However for other people the SM-58 works better.  It depends on your voice and what you want the mic to do.  If you have a very deep voice, the SM-58 might be the second best choice after the SM-57 which has a better low frequency response.\n\nOne certain advantage of the SM-58 is the excellent gain before feedback capability.  This mic can be turned up louder than almost any other mic without that annoying PA squeal.  Another advantage of the SM-58 is that it is still available (at a slight extra cost) with a built-in on\/off switch.  The SM-58's ball shaped grills are very sturdy and even if you should dent one you can get a replacement which screws right on for about ten dollars.  I've seen SM-58's dented, rusty, dusty, smoked up, spit into, with pieces missing and slammed into a hardwood stage with the full weight of a boom stand adding mass to the fall and yet I've never seen but one stop working and that malfunction was due to an on\/off switch that got dirt in it.\n\nAll the pro-line Shure mics are top quality.  The pro line Shures also hold their value well.  If you buy one and decide you don't like it, you can get about what you paid for it on eBay.  I would compare as many mics as possible before buying one.  Senneheiser's EVOLUTION mics sound really good too and are worth a look. The SM-58 will be the number one on-stage vocal mic for the foreseeable future because most people follow the crowd instead of actually trying out different mics and picking the one that works best for their particular voice.  These things are so durable that even if they stopped making them today they'd still be around for another 20 years at least.","summary":"Good for vocals only!","unixReviewTime":1147737600,"vote":371.0,"style":{"style:":" Cable Included"},"image":null}

Johnson","reviewText":"Both the Shure SM57 and SM58 microphones (which, by the way, are the same internally) are considered industry workhorses.  You see these things pop up everywhere, from studios to live gigs to concerts on TV.  They are everywhere.  Which I find a bit strange because, frankly, they don't sound good.\n\nThe design of these mics goes back about 40 years.  A lot has happened with microphone technology during that time.  These models may have been very good decades ago, but they are really showing their age.  The most prominent problem with them is the sound quality... they are quite \"honky\" making everyone sound far more nasal than they do in real life.  There are some situations where that might be okay, but unless you are a vocalist who actually wants to sound more nasal than you do in reality, there are much better choices out there, as these two mics will really emphasize any honkiness\/nasality of your voice.\n\nIn a shootout in my studio with more than 20 different models of mics, the SM57\/58 were clearly near the bottom of the list.  Virtually every other microphone we tested sounded better.  And I'm not talking about comparing it to $3500 Neumann U87 mics either... half of the mics we used can be had for under $150.  Another, much better choice in a similar price range is the AKG D5, or you can step up to the Shure Beta 58, which is much, much better, and a microphone I can easily recommend.  Both of these other mics also have better off-axis rejection and higher gain before feedback.\n\nI know that nearly everyone uses these mics, but that doesn't actually mean they are that good.  There are much better choices for your money.  \"Tradition\" alone isn't a great reason to buy a particular product, especially in a technology-heavy field.\n\nOn the plus side, both the SM57 and SM58 are nearly bullet-proof.  You can really abuse them and they'll sound just like they did when they were brand-new.\n\nAside from the extreme durability (which is now nearly standard in similarly-priced models), the only other reason to consider an SM58 instead of another option is if you want to be the lazy sound guy that doesn't want to even try to create a proper mix and prefers to rely on the odd mid-range peak of this mic to make a vocal cut through a mix of instruments.  Please take note, though, that doesn't mean that it is going to sound great... just that you'll have that odd and annoying honky peak standing out in the mix over everything else.  If you like being the sound engineer that doesn't want to mess with proper mic selection and bother with equalization to create a good mix, maybe the SM57\/SM58 actually are the mics for you.  (Inevitably when I attend an event with a terrible mix I'll see SM58s all over the stage.)  As for me and anyone else that makes sound quality and great mixes a priority, we'll probably select something else.","summary":"Seriously overrated","unixReviewTime":1351900800,"vote":38.0,"style":{"style:":" Cable Not Included"},"image":null}

Stillwater","reviewText":"Are there other dynamic microphones that are better sounding than the SM58?  Yes.  Then why have I given it a 5 star?  Well I am glad you asked.  It's a legendary piece of musical equipment.  The microphone has existed for half a century, and I am willing to bet for all of you that are reading this that it will still exist when we all pass away.  There are three things that will survive a nuclear bomb.  Roaches, Keith Richards, and the SM58!  The durability of this microphone is amazing.  Just  youtube  SM58 and you will see some durability experiments that will speak for it self.  It can stand abuse like no other microphone period.  SM58 are standards live microphones in the industry.  Do they sound better than some Beyerdynamic Opus models or Sennheisers?  My opinion would be no, but you take to consideration when you have a Sound company they will use 80% to 90% of the time a SM58.  The reason is most soundmen have learned to eq around it and they are familiar with that microphone.  A sound guy that does not know a SM58 is not a sound technician to begin with.  If you know a little eq you can make this mic sound very good.  You buy a fancy dynamic mic and you run the risk of a sound guy screwing up your sound.  Anybody bashing this mic has to be reminded that legendary singers have all sung on a sm58 at one point.  From Robert Plant to Sinatra.  Not to mention every time you see a major festival it's the main mic on stage.  This mic has not changed it's specs or design since the 1960's.  What does that tell you?  For about $99 you have invested in microphone that will be with you most of your life.","summary":"Standard Microphone For Shure","unixReviewTime":1266969600,"vote":7.0,"style":null,"image":null}

One of the very first mics we truly fell in love with was the SM58. Introduced by the Shure Brothers Company in 1966, the SM58 quickly rose to become the industry standard in rugged road mics that actually sound good to the ear and are nearly indestructible.\n\nThe mic capsule is of cardiord (heart shaped) design which helps reject sound from either side. There is a 4K bump in it's frequency which helps vocals cut through stage noise. Construction is rugged, frequency response is 50 to 15,000 Hz, and the capsule sits internally on a foam shock mount to help isolate it from handling noise.\n\nWe used to joke about the SM58 in that if you needed a hammer and you couldn't find one, just grab one of these, they are that tough. I've seen some of these on the road that you couldn't believe still worked, but they did and sounded great.\n\nThe cage style pop screen gives the SM58 not only it's distinctive look, one that influenced many other mic brands from the day it was introduced, but it's part of the functionality. Internally lined with a layer of acoustic foam, the cage helps keep vocals pops from getting to the dynamic mic element.

It's not terrible, and certainly a good price, but the other option is the better one. At the time, I only found 2 XLR cords around 15-20ft in length and $5-6 in price so I don't know if others have come or gone or prices have changed.\n\nThe ends seem to be of a cheap metal (aluminum, I'm guessing), and don't seem as good as the competitions. Also the connector doesn't lock in as well as the other ones. Neither unit has serviceable connectors, but I didn't expect that for this price.\n\nThis isn't bad, and the quality isn't much worse than the other unit I purchased though. I would take either cord almost interchangeably, but given the choice I would choose the other cord.\n\nI don't expect either to last forever at such a low price. The value on both cords is exceptional. The good news is, with XLR, as long as you're getting a connection the quality of the cable doesn't have much (any) impact on the quality of the sound.

I have a personal preference for the XLR ends with the really fine threaded plastic cap on the outside (first to slide down the cable) with a 4 legged gripper underneath that slides next down the cable and pinches down as you tighten the plastic outer cap into the metal housing with the solder contacts causing the gripper to strain relief most cable diameters.  Unfortunately that design isn't used here, but I chose to award the 5 star rating for value because you get 15' of good quality shielded cable with 2 XLR ends (M and F) for well under $1\/ft.\n\nAs for pinout it's straightforward, pin 1 is tied to the metal grip and shield and connects between both ends, while pins 2 and 3 are run isolated between both ends.  The end design chosen uses the single set screw connector (the tiny one that gets lost so easy if you need to take it apart) and the rubber bumper design on the back which I haven't had the best of luck making quick changes in the field with, however for interconnecting equipment on a temporary basis these cables are an important starting point of any audio engineer's kit because they will be used not if but WHEN the need arises.\n\nAnother favorite of mine is the 6 pack of 3 foot male to female cables which do use my favorite XLR ends mentioned above, which amazon will rush you:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/GLS-Audio-3ft-Patch-Cable-Cords-XLR-Male-To-XLR-Female-Black-Cables-3-Balanced-Snake-Cord-6-PACK\/dp\/B000RYP83I\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">GLS Audio 3ft Patch Cable Cords - XLR Male To XLR Female Black Cables - 3' Balanced Snake Cord - 6 PACK<\/a>&nbsp;- these are very easy to open an end, change phase, lift ground, or input someone's oddball source signal.  Having 6 on hand means you won't quibble over cable costs before the show starts and that channel will be in the final mix.\n\nBack to pyle's product here, I basically took away 1 star for not using the easy to open and re-wire XLRs but gave them a star for value in the product since it's 15 feet long and will reach between my mixer and most anything else inside the booth for under a buck a foot.  It's also great when someone yells \"it's too short I need a cable stretcher at the podium!\" and quickly adds 15 feet of noise free movement to a stage snake that either wasn't planned for or got moved\/quit working.  For the price they have saved many installations from being torn up or rewired which means no surprises opening the next showing.\n\nI finally equipped my cable kit with the usual XLR to  RCA, 1\/4 TRS, hi-z transformers, and the above mentioned 6 pack of 3 foot cables to quickly gain access to the XLR terminals if need be, plus 2 of these 15 foot cables mainly to solve distance problems, and a roll of gaffer's tape for good measure to prevent tripping hazards.  I used to have 2ea 50 foot XLR cables but no sooner than the box was opened one became a permanent addition to the stage snake so now I have one left for my kit. With all that I had to build an emergency XLR to 2.5mm TS all metal shielded connector for a mike input on short notice so a soldering kit with misc plugs got added to my cable bin.  Even though all this was under $100 it has saved the day more than once and made the show go on, so a bit of \"what if\" thinking and judicial purchases can make you look like the miracle mixer in the black painted room and justify your existance when the owner's daugher's toy musicbox becomes a channel in the house mix thanks to some quick cable magic.\n\nMy last cable advice is never deconstruct something you custom made.  It will no doubt be needed again, and since you made it you'll know why, how, and where it was used before, thus you save time not recreating a past fix rather pulling it from your magic box of tricks and solving the problem.  People think you can hook anything up where others tried and failed furthering your staff position.  My only exception goes to cables that violate every standard and didn't serve to fix the problem like that phase reversed ground lifted XLR 4 pin stereo Y splitter to dual TRS female cable I made for the harmonica duet where the performers had nose rings and lip bars pierced and kept getting static with their mics when they held the harmonica up to their jewelry.  I chalked that up to being part of the intended musical signal, wondering just how much it hurt to play with all the piercings scraping along the harmonica when I setup my monitor speakers to listen to just that (stereo) channel in rehersal at the console.","summary":"This gets 5 stars for value but doesn't use my favorite XLR end","unixReviewTime":1272326400,"vote":4.0,"style":{"Size:":" One Size"},"image":null}

I just mean, if you are serious in trying to learn guitar... do not.  These things are always overly cheap and unplayable.  I have a few cheap models of Silvertone guitars that are for display purposes only (signed by artists) and, trust me, as a guitarist who owns many guitars, I cant even play these things. They are so cheap, the strings do not stay in tune, usually have intonation problems (cant clear frets and thus buzz and pop or never have proper note frequences at all the frets).  They usually always feel cheap too and the feel does affect the playability and tone.  If you want to really learn you have to pay at least a little more and go for better brands.  I would recommend anyone serious in learning to never buy a guitar that costs under $300... you are just wasting your money and the problems and limitations may even frustrate you and work against you learning how to play.  Go for the brands that are made by the bigger dogs... like ESP's LTD brand... Gibson's Epiphone brand, or Fender's lower brand (Squire?).  There are other examples.  I am sure Ibanez has some good lower models (though I am not sure they have a lower brand name for their cheaper gear).  If you do have to go for a cheaper brand, at least then buy their top of the line models (this pertains to Dean, for example).

The pickup selector switch would cause bursts of static when switching while playing - cheap pickups and very little tone control - even though this is meant to resemble a Fender Strat - that's the extent of any comparison.

Overall the guitar is nice, my wifes Ibanez side by side they look nearly as pleasing.  The Ibanez is a different animal so I will not be using it to compare quality, just the looks.  I bought the Black package, and it looks good in the living room on a stand.\n\nOverall the kit is decent.  Is it a 4 star product . . . no, but its price and how its packaged added points.\n\nThe amp is not loud or low enough for a Bass, but again if you are just learning it will have no problem getting the job done.  Do not assume it will be heard over any other instrument though.  The guitar is passive, meaning you will have to crank the amp to get some volume out of it. It does a great job in the living room just making noises as I pluck, smack, and push around the strings.  As I have no idea what Im doing, thats why I bought the kit. My wife who has been playing 75% of her life picked it up, tuned it ( not with the tuner it came with) and just started jamming away.  She was impressed with it as it was just a $135 package she was smiling the whole time goofing off with it.  So it will do its job for what I want.\n\nThe Guitar is pretty, sounds good, action is high.  I mention the action as high, as when your banging away on bass if its a low action you will get buzzing, this one has no such issue.  The only 2 gripes I have with the Bass itself is 1) its passive, so to use it with my pc or playstation (Rocksmith) I will need a preamp, 2) the picture of all 3 types have a thumb rest.  It is 100% the reason I bought this kit over the Dean, and its no there.  Oh well its home now, so itll do.  Just disappointing that its no as pictured.  Again it plays nice, sounds good on the tiny amp, wife had no complaints when jamming so Ill chalk it up to a win.\n\nThe Tuner it came with is small, very tidy, and doesnt work on the E string.  It works on my acoustic, and electrics as it uses vibration not sound to register.  Would not tune in the bass it came with.  I like the style of it so it will be donated to my church for them to use on stage.\n\nBag is just a bag\n\nStrap will cut your head off after a few hours.

Williams","reviewText":"I play several instruments and have recently decided to give the bass a try.  I placed my order on Thursday, it shipped Friday and I received it Monday.  Mine was sold by American Music Outlet. The shipping time was great and it was double boxed.\n\nGuitar: Looks nice and setup and intonation was perfect right out of the box. I was a little surprised by the fact that the neck looks to be unfinished wood.  I'm a little concerned about this and debating as to whether to try to put some type of sealant \/ finish on it for protection.  There is a minor problem with the tone control on the guitar, but I've spent many years working in electronics and it will be easier to just fix it than return the guitar I think.  These are the type things I've come to expect to have to deal with when you buy imported products online cheap.\n\nI think a new set of strings will improve the performance immensely.  The stock strings sound ok but they seem to be very course wound and are pretty noisy when you move your fingers on them.  I may put a set of flats on it.  The neck has a minor little cosmetic nick or two in the wood, but they have no effect on its playing and are basically invisible unless your are inspecting it very closely from inches away.  The guitar is a nice weight and the neck unexpectedly thin, which is nice if you have smaller hands as I do. It is a very attractive instrument overall and plays very nicely.\n\nAmp: It is a 10 watt practice amp, and that is basically what it is good for.  You might get enough volume to play with a small acoustic group (which is what I do), but it you are going to play with other amplified instruments, plan on buying a real amp. The amp does look fairly well made, and has EQ controls and a headset jack.  It has a nice sound, just not overly loud.  There is some hum but I believe this to be from the cheap cable supplied with it.  In my case it could also be coming from the problem with the tone control mentioned above.\n\nAccessories: As stated in other reviews, the accessories are nothing to write home about.  The case fits well and the zipper works smoothly, but has absolutely no padding. It will keep the dust off and give you a carrying handle, but that's about it. The strap is about a $10 nylon strap...you'll probably want something more comfortable if you plan on playing much.  As mentioned earlier, the cable from the guitar to the amp is a very cheap one.  It probably causes hum and at best will not hold up very long. I have a bunch of good cables, so that's not really an issue.  The tuner supplied works fine.  Put the batteries in, switch the switch to \"Bass\" and tune for the green lights on the appropriate string notes.  Mine was very close to being in tune out of the box, just a slight bit low on all strings. The tuners on the guitar work smoothly.  I haven't even looked at the DVD, but according to other reviews, it is not all that great.  I bought this package for the guitar and amp, so the accessories are not really that big of a concern to me. I will throw a tip in...there is a very good, complete beginners course available online at studybass.com, and it is absolutely free.\n\nOverall: I stole this for $131 shipped! Last one at that price. These are going online from $169.95 to $199.95.  Considering that, I would say that I'm pretty pleased with it. It's well worth what I paid, even with having to make a minor repair. If you're looking to pick up a playable bass and practice amp on the cheap, its probably a decent buy at the $169 range.  If I were going to spend much more than that, however, I think I would probably go with the Peavey guitar\/amp package that sells for around $100 more. The main reason being that it comes with a bigger amp that would probably be a little more versatile for things other than practice.","summary":"Nice Starter Instrument for the money","unixReviewTime":1318291200,"vote":8.0,"style":{"Color:":" Liquid Black"},"image":null}

Fret buzzing is minimal and with the few adjustments I made it might even hold its own on a gig. The first thing I did was change the factory strings to some better grade Flat-Wounds and that helped a lot.\nThe Amp that comes with this kit is really cool too. It has a 4 band equalizer for highs, lows, hi-mids, and low mids. I gets to a nice volume for \"bedroom practice\" but I would not blast it for sake of the speaker. Getting BOTH this amp and the bass itself for this price is a bargain.\nThe only reason that I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is still a beginners guitar.

I have been playing electric guitar for quite a while, but I wanted to try the bass. But I did not want to pay too much since I did not know if I would like it. I found this package being sold by American Music Outlet for less $ than the bass can be bought without the amp elsewhere. The guitar is beautifully finished, and was well set up. (I got the sunburst.) To me it sounds good as well. The amp is sufficient for practice. The bag is NOT padded, but if you are careful it can be useful for transporting the guitar. Other than the unpadded bag I got exactly what was promised. I have owned a Silvertone Les Paul guitar for a couple of years and have had no problems with it, so I expect this bass will be of similar quality. I haven't been playing the Les Paul much since I got the bass; I am always playing the bass. If you have not already been playing some sort of guitar, you might need more instruction than is provided by the DVD included in this package. I have been playing mostly by ear and am having a great time.","summary":"Everything you need to get started playing bass.","unixReviewTime":1273190400,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

And you're looking to start playing bass guitar, but aren't so self-assured or financially inclined that you're looking to spend a lot of money on a beginning instrument.  Which brings you to starter sets in the first place.  You want everything you need at a good price while not sacrificing playability.  And to me: that's exactly what this set is.\n\nThe bass itself is quite nice, exceeding my expectations.  Any pictures you find online usually wash out the shine and make the color look flat and boring.  But it's a pretty striking, deep, shiny black.  It's not a $1000 bass, but it looks way nicer than the price would make you think it does.  As for sound, I've never played a bass before, so I have nothing to compare it to.  However, the amp brings the sound through pretty cleanly and warmly.  And I really have no complaints.\n\nThe thumb rest on the bass just seemed to detract from the aesthetic appeal, and got in my way when moving down a string.  I find it's just as easy to rest your thumb on the pickup when playing the E string.  Although it can be removed easily and in short order with an average-sized Phillips screwdriver, it leaves kind of unsightly screw holes behind, that had low-laying, somewhat jagged edges.  I filed that down carefully with some sandpaper, and it's now fine.  If there's anything I have against the bass, it's the thumb rest.  Since it's removable, it's really no big deal.  Just making note of it.\n\nRegarding accessories:\nThe case is, as others have said, not capable of protecting against anything except scratches or dust.  It's better than nothing, but the bottom-mounted zipper makes casing and uncasing awkward and slow, and I always worry about the fabric pulling on one of the tuning keys and untuning it.\n\nThe picks are picks.  Rounded, triangular pieces of plastic.  I haven't used them, because I've preferred finger-plucking so far.  Feels way more assured and direct, plus I find it easier to mute strings with the pick not in the way.  But they're a nice addition, for those that want them.\n\nThe strap is extremely simple.  It feels somewhat cheaply made and thin, but it will suffice, temporarily.  Just like the case, eventually you'll probably want another, better one.\n\nThe tuner feels kind of lightweight and flimsy, but it seems to work okay.  I have no thoughts that it will break soon unless I'm rough with it.\n\nThe DVD was a nice addition, and did teach me a little.  But most of the material can be absorbed in a single viewing, and probably figured out completely in three or four.  It's also quite short.  Also a nice addition (and includes electric and acoustic guitar sections) but you will want more books, DVDs, a teacher, or all of the above to really get onto learning the bass.\n\nThe bass guitar had been on my sizable list of \"Instruments to try out, eventually...\" for some time, but upon starting the anime series Beck (which any rock fan would love, regardless of age or thoughts toward Japanese animation) I realized it was simply time to start.  And I don't think I could have picked a better starter set for the price.  I've only had this thing for a day, but currently I'm 100% satisfied.  Shipping was super-quick, too.  I'll add to this review if anything breaks.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I'd like to continue practicing...","summary":"Love My Silvertone Bass","unixReviewTime":1271808000,"vote":3.0,"style":{"Color:":" Liquid Black"},"image":null}

Ambient noise is not reduced greatly as a result, but this design improves sound quality.\n\nI have used the 600 ohm K240M phones since 1986.  The new K240S are 55 ohms making them far more compatible with todays lower voltage gear.  Even better, this new design gives deep bass response that I never thought was possible from phones.  Even a 32 foot bombarde pipe organ stop sounds quite real, although you will not feel the room shake.  Listening to a signal generator through these new K240S phones gives an impression of powerful bass down to at least 40 Hz.  The old K240M drops off below 100 Hz.  A slight dip in the midrange(K240M) has been filled in, making the K240S more true sounding.\n\nBoth the new and old versions reproduce operatic voices without increased \"ping\" which can be very abrasive.  Years ago I started using phones to judge voices on choral recordings, resorting to speakers only to judge the organ sound.  Speakers can make some beautiful voices sound nasty.  Producer John Culshaw documented this in one of his books on recording the Wagner Ring.\n\nThe open air design minimizes ear sweating while giving a more open perspective.  \"In your head\" effects are greatly suppressed compared to many sealed type phones.  When watching opera DVD I find no conflict between the phone perspective and the TV screen on DVD that are well mixed.  Orchestral sound is excellent, as is piano.  To my ears, these phones give a perspective and tonal balance that is very close to what I hear at Boston Symphony Hall, when I sit in the second balcony front.  These seats overhang the stage.  When I sing in a choir, the live perspective is even closer to what the phones produce, provided my position on stage is fairly central.  This is, in my opinion, a valid sound perspective, even if it is quite different from the tenth row center sound I aim for when I build speakers.  Non performers sometimes have trouble accepting this close a perspective at first, only because it is not familiar.  Many other phones give a perspective that is too close for comfort, a good reason to avoid the low end.\n\nIt is good to bear in mind that individual ears are unique in shape and that phones are designed to work on a \"standard ear\" made with an average shape.  Phones will give different response curves depending on how your ear pinnae and canal differs from that \"laboratory standard ear\" shape.\n\nPeople with small heads will have trouble keeping the phones on.  It is unfortunate that although this problem has been known for years, nothing has been done to correct this.\n\nAKG did not change any parts that touch your ears and head, a very wise move.  Some parts are interchangeble, as they have the same stock number on AKG parts lists.  Unfortunately AKG has of late been hard to deal with, making part purchases difficult.\n\nConsider buying the K 240 studio phones in the MK II version as you get a spare cord and spare ear pads with a velvet like feel. Having these extra parts on hand is worth the extra cost and makes this four star item a 5 star item.","summary":"IMPROVED VERSION OF K240 MONITOR AND A REAL THREAT TO SPEAKER SUPREMACY","unixReviewTime":1163721600,"vote":231.0,"style":null,"image":null}

And this one can pull apart the tendrils of classical music well.  The lack of bass is really a perception, as most headphones I've heard like to warm up the lower-mid's to thicken the sauce of the music, but that of course can muddy music that needs some clarity.  I suppose with the 'neutral' bass, though, it is a little less engaging than other 'phones.  Like when I listen to a jazz combo, it's clean but the upright bass has lost its kick--again, compared to other headphones.  This gets so close to the pair of Stax headphones I have, which are so good.. and $700.  just a little less engaged than the stax, which I guess does make a difference over time.  whereas I would listen to the stax for hours, this maybe 30-45 min.  I am using it to monitor my keyboard work, where I have to hear differences between various historical models of piano on my laptop; each note comes off the way it should, not warmed up as I mentioned.  the Fidelio x2's were more of a fun headphone that I still found clear-sounding, but they are double the price.  and the hifiman or course is good, but double again the price.  whew!","summary":"Lots of clarity but can you handle it?!","unixReviewTime":1520035200,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

Johnson","reviewText":"I've been reading a lot of very positive reviews for these headphones, so I bought a pair to add to my collection.  I'm a huge fan of AKG microphones, so I've been excited to hear what they're doing with their headphones.  As it turns out, they're good, but not great.\n\nHigh frequencies are a little too loud and more harsh than I'd expect for a set of headphones in this class.  This really causes many of the artifacts caused by MP3 encoding to be over-emphasized.  Instead of being smooth and silky they are a bit cutting and shimmery.  If I was to listen to these at anything over a moderate volume level for long my ears would fatigue rather quickly.  That boost does occasionally help certain types of music, though.  For example, as I'm writing this I'm listening to Lindsey Stirling's \"Elements\" and the high frequency boost makes it easier to hear some of what one of the synth parts is doing compared to other headphones.  But on other tracks it is distracting and unpleasant.  Demi Lovato's voice, for example, is a little grating on these headphones while perfectly fine on others.\n\nThe low end is a bit of a mixed bag.  There seems to be a bit of a boost right around 100 Hz but everything below that is definitely quieter than they ought to be.  The 100-Hz boost is probably why some feel like they have more bass they really do.  But below that they are definitely a little thin and lacking.  They are capable of producing really low frequencies, but they just aren't very loud when doing so.\n\nThe mid-range is also a bit weak.  Vocals seem more distant than they should, especially in comparison to the sibilants which are in your face (again, this is why it is hard for me to listen to Demi Lovato).  There is also a little bit of unwanted honkiness between 1kHz and 1.5kHz as well.  Not bad, but they definitely aren't producing a flat response through the mids.\n\nCompared to my other headphones these are a lot quieter than other models.  I have to turn up the volume nearly all the way on my MP3 player to get sufficient volume.  My other headphones play at comfortable volumes with the player's volume control at half of what is required for the K240s.\n\nIn comparison to the Sony MDR-V6 or MDR-7506 these aren't nearly as good.  At least not if you're talking about accurate reproduction of sound.  The Sonys are much flatter (as in, more accurate, not dull), which means they are both easier and more enjoyable to listen to.\n\nRelative to the Grado SR80e, the Grados definitely have a huge edge over the AKGs.  The SR80e model doesn't have the same aural deficiencies.  But they do rest directly on your ears, which some people may not like.\n\nThey do blow away any <$150 Sennheisers though.  I still haven't figured out why anyone likes the modestly priced Sennheiser headphones.  They all sound awful.\n\nAll in all, these probably are better than any pair of headphones that most people will ever listen to.  But for the money you can do better.  I'd take them over pretty much anything less than $50 for sure, but for just a couple bucks more you can get the amazing MDR-V6 if you are okay with closed backs, or Grado SR80e if you prefer something more open.","summary":"Good, but not great.","unixReviewTime":1448928000,"vote":2.0,"style":null,"image":null}

Clear instrument separation regardless of the relatively minuscule soundstage compared to other open headphones. Again, very flat frequency response and good for mixing - though actual accuracy is a tad underwhelming. For actually listening, the mids are a tad too powerful by comparison to the low end for my taste - and I am by no means a basshead - but it can lead to some over-sibilant vocals and harsh cymbals overtaking the high end. It would be inappropriate to say that they're not top of the line for the price you pay though, as I'm truly nitpicking and wouldn't have expected them to sound any better.\n\nBUILD -\n\nWell, they're certainly lightweight. This comes at a cost though, as they're flimsy and cheaply constructed. Again, not unexpected for the price paid and honestly I'd rather have better sound than build at this price point. If you expect to really beat them up though, they'll most likely not appreciate it from a structural standpoint.\n\nVALUE -\n\nGreat, but not exceptional.

TWiT.TV uses these in their production, so that was certainly a plus and helped me to seal the purchase (as once you get into studio monitor quality headphones, they become harder to distinguish between them).\n\nThe EQ on these headphones is a flat one, unlike regular consumer headsets that focus extensively on bass (even some 'gaming' headsets have high focus on bass response to the detriment of music listening).\n\nAccording to TWiT.TV, these are studio quality headphones meant for playback and are designed to be used in production of media. I wholeheartedly agree and also state that these are well made and fit me well.\n\nI started looking at studio quality headsets when I discovered that my Steelseries gaming headset was starting the die (the cord was, once again, causing loss of sound in one ear piece and the microphone no longer worked). I would have normally stayed with the steelseries and bought a new one, but then I looked at the price for a v1 headset - it has not gone down once in the four years I have owned this model (actually a replacement for the same model) and remains at $60 or so. A new v2 headset is even more expensive and still has the same problems (non-removable cord, internal mic included, which is rather tiny).\n\nI decided the best way to solve this problem and to avoid having to buy new headphones every couple of years (at $60 per headphone, too!) was to separate the microphone from the headset (get a headset with no internal mic) and focus on headsets that promote removable cords (as at that point replacement cords can be had cheaply, rather than replacing the whole setup).\n\nAs I have heard, AKG is not a well-known brand of studio quality headsets (here in Amercia, Sony-brand studio monitors and alike are the norm in productions that I have observed) but my quality assessment of these is that they sound GREAT.\nThe price was just right, only a few dollars more than a replacement headset, and the specs are even better looking than my old gaming headset. These are semi-open headphones, so others may be able to hear what you're listening to - but I usually run my computers at 21 volume because I have sensitive ears (I hate loud volume, unlike every one else in my family who are all 100-volume users).\n\nMy experience is that I can not hear the music from any distance with these headphones at the usual 21 volume. The bass and treble are all perfectly natural and the virtual stage (a 2.0 setup) makes sounds in the music more clear than they ever were with my old headset. I can pick out the individual instruments in the classical music easily with these headphones, whereas before they were all meshed together because of the massive bass boost on the older gaming headset.\n\nI am highly satisfied with my purchase and will definitely buy from this brand again, should I need to.","summary":"Great headset, sturdy, with a flat EQ (no bass boost).

I love all kinds of music from popular to acoustic to classical.  The bass in the AKG K240 drops off severely below 50 Hz and is nearly inaudible at 30 Hz even though the product description claims 15 Hz.  Any attempt to boost the bass will result in fluttering sounds of driver excursion. I personally prefer to leave my music source flat and I don't like using bass boost, but I want to hear natural sounding clear and sufficiently loud bass.\n\nHere's a spectral plot analysis of the acoustic music video \"It's Time\" from \"Imagine Dragons\". http:\/\/bit.ly\/1nbufm8\n\nEven though it's acoustic music (they don't even use true bass instruments), there's a lot of music between 30 and 70 Hz.  So contrary to the opinions of music elitists who frown at \"bassheads\" and the bass heavy products, we really do need good bass reproduction for all sorts of music.  What the elitists who give this product a high rating call \"flat\" or \"neutral\" is misleading.  Flat should mean the frequency response is flat throughout the music frequency spectrum.\n\nAll that said, I will say that I like the build quality and the detachable cable.","summary":"Bass drops off below 50 Hz","unixReviewTime":1412640000,"vote":5.0,"style":null,"image":null}

Used them for about 15 years until they were damaged in a mishap.  I've had other 'phones since then, most notably the Nakamichi SP-7, but none I liked as much as that old pair from the past.  So when I saw that they were either still - or once again - available (and on sale) I had to get a pair especially since I'm using headphones a lot lately.  I just had to know whether they were as good as I recalled.\n\nThey are better.  Improved, I guess.  They still look, feel and fit the same - and that's a good thing.  The bass is deep and well-defined, not artificially boosted but can thump with the best when a thump is on the recording(Gov't Mule's \"Lay Your Burden Down\").  Highs are clean and well-extended - certainly they go higher than my 10khz cutoff hearing - younger folks who've passed through like the highs.  Mids sound good, with virtually none of the congestion you can get with lesser 'phones or speakers.  As the mids become more complex due to multiple instruments, its easy to follow just one (for instance cello in several quartets I sampled).\n\nDynamics are great, as heard in Glenn Miller Orchestra, \"In the Digital Mood,\"  \"Chattanooga Choo Choo\" track, and the Tchaikovsky \"1812 Overture\" in this case on Telarc.  With movies, explosions can be startling.\n\nIn addition to sound quality, these headphones are also superlative in other ways.  One is the way they fit.  Yes, they are pretty large, but the large cups fit around the ear and press against the skull, which reduces ear soreness to virtually none.  The gimbal construction, which auto adjusts when simply put on the head has always been a strong point of this headphone.  I can wear them for hours with no ear soreness.\n\nAlso, fit and finish is excellent - AKG have obviously kept QC standards up despite having these made now in China.  Connections are first-rate, and the cable enters at the Left earcup as the good Lord intended.  I love the compactness and fit of the screw-on 1\/4\" plug (an adaptor that fits over the 1\/8\" - 3.5mm - plug).\n\nThe one area in which the headphone does not excel is isolation, but that is to be expected with an open (they call it semi-open) type cup construction.  On the other hand, it is extremely difficult to attain this level of sonic excellence in a closed-back design.  I've heard none, if they exist, but even if there is one I'm sure it would be much more pricey.  Generally, one just expects to give up the \"airy\" sound of an open design with a closed headphone, so it depends on the importance of isolation to the listener.  I have a pair of closed-backs to use when needed, but most of the time I'll be using these.\n\nI'm not saying these are perfect, but they are as close as I'll get, since I certainly won't spend more than a c-note on headphones - it just wouldn't be prudent.  I pushed my own limits to get these at just less than seventy bucks, and I'm darned glad that I did.  My opinion then is obvious - best at the price, and better than many to which I've listened in the past that were much more expensive.","summary":"Strong Five-Star Product:  Excellent Sound, Looks, Fit 'n Finish, Comfort, and Value","unixReviewTime":1412035200,"vote":3.0,"style":null,"image":null}

Straight forward review.  No technical talk for those that understand great specs do not always mean great headphones.  These do have great specs, by the way.\n\nI have a pair of older 240s that are 600 ohms.  These are essentially the same except they are 55 ohms.  So, it takes less power to drive them.  What that means is that if you use a low output device (phone, computer, etc.) you will get more volume.  The volume is considerably louder than the older 240s and most studio reference headphones.  However, they are not nearly as loud as headphones designed specifically for portable devices.  All that said, they sound great with my Galaxy S4 and Galaxy Tab Pro.  You do not need a separate headphone amp.  Normal people do not use headphone amps.  I dont; know why everyone always talks about them.  No amp needed.  If you are using these with mixing board or plunging them into an old-fashioned stereo, you certainly do not need an amp. they are loud.  With a portable device they are louder than most people would need.  but again, not as loud as something designed for a portable device.\n\nAs far as sound, these are some of the best sounding headphones I have tried.  The sound is flat - like it should be.  All sounds, highs, mids, and lows, come through crystal clear.  Unless you want to spend several hundreds of dollars more, I really haven;'t heard anything even close to the 240s.  Cranked up, they handle loud volume without distorting.\n\nAs far a comfort, these are the single most comfortable headphones ever made.  Period!  They are circumaural, which means they fit completely around your ear.  They completely go around your ear (at least my ear) without any on-ear pressure.  They are light weight and the adjustable band literally makes them weightless.  Within a few minutes you will forget they are on.  I watched a movie on my computer and had these on for about 2 1\/2 hours.  There was no strain or pressure anywhere.  My ears and the top of my head didn't feel anything.\n\nThe 240s also have a detachable replaceable cord. this is abig plus as cords are the things which seem to go bad before anything else.\n\nI realize sound preferences and fit are completely subjective.  For me they are the best phones I have ever owned.  For sound and comfort the AKG 240 Studio headphones are as good a it gets.","summary":"One of the best headphones out there!","unixReviewTime":1404864000,"vote":3.0,"style":null,"image":null}

I really just wanted a decent pair of them, and so I put my time in and \"experienced\" just about every pair available at a local (large) showroom. I tried the $500 pairs and the middle roads, and the cheapies...and frankly, they all fit and sounded (to me) roughly the same. I certainly expected a lot more for $500 is what I am really saying here, (like maybe seeing earth from orbit. I mean - $500? Are you effing kidding me?). In any case, I was unimpressed.\n\nSo. I read more reviews and decided to try these, it said \"Studio\" headphones, I assumed long periods of use and comfort when I first put them on. But again, I was unimpressed, they mashed my head and ears like I had a head mashing machine installed. But with some tweaking, they have grown on me quite a bit.\n\nSound. So far these seem decent enough, and overall quality is pretty good. Certainly no worse than the $500 ones, comparatively speaking. Far better quality than the $30 cheapies, certainly. I'd say they are about par with everything else I tried over $50-$60. Maybe the Wilkens\/Bowers were a bit more comfy. But not for $500. Yet, the clarity of sound from these K240's seem about the same. Of course, that is from memory, not side-by-side.\n\nComfort: What I now grasp is that I didn't consider that ears in ones youth can hear frequencies I (now older) do not, and that \"comfortable\" is often pure subjective opinion (apparently). So, many headphone reviews (amazon professional or otherwise) for me then became pure BS. What I mean here is these (like every other pair I have owned) just didn't fit me that well when they arrived - my ears touched the interior headphone walls. This colored my initial opinions considerably.\n\nThing is, I have ears that stick out a bit. Some research revealed the same exact (unsurprising) attitudes of other headphone owners, and - they \"MODDED out the problem.\" Some people will go to lengthy repair efforts, others just go simple\/cheap. It struck me while standing looking in the mirror I already HAD a solution...using similar steps.\n\nTweaks: What some folks do is stuff cotton under the ear pads to lift the pads up a bit, away from the ears. Using cotton supposedly stiffens the pads up a bit, but the results are worth it. My adapted solution was close, and reusable.\n\nI used 8 memory foam earplugs stuffed under the earpads (4 per ear side, top, bottom, left\/right under the pads.) Best part is cotton doesn't reshape, where memory foam does...and pulling in or pushing them out a bit makes for easy adjustments.\n\nAnd it works for any \"over the ear\" that have ear pads that lift up on the inside.\n\nThe other thing is that those \"bars\" that run over the top of the headband are actually wires coated in plastic, not just plastic. They can be bent and flattened out some for better comfort if your head is getting squeezed, just be a bit careful and take your time to get good results.\n\nLastly, some Velcro can be used to add some soft foam to the underside of of the headband (doesn't have any) easily enough. Total tweaks cost - about $10 or so.\n\nNow they are FAR more comfortable. Wish I had tried that out when I owned my old Beyers.\n\nSo, while my opinion of these were of returning them when I first got them, I no longer feel that way. Some tweaking helped quite a bit. I have also read that headphones usually \"improve\" with some \"burn-in\", and while I do not know if that is true, I do like the sound better now that I did when I first tried them on. I initially had the opinion of returning them, but with some comfort tweaking I decided I am going to keep them.","summary":"AKG K-240 Headphones....and comfort tweaking.","unixReviewTime":1390608000,"vote":2.0,"style":null,"image":null}

Also I can listen to music for hours and hours on them because they are so non-fatiguing: marvelously balanced and even have a slight treble roll-off, which is fine for someone getting on in years like me who's probably already lost a bit of the higher frequency hearing (above 15KHz).  The Grados on the other hand are impressive when you first plug them in because they are rather \"hot\"---the highest and lowest frequencies seem to be accentuated, which makes them kind of \"fun\" headphones especially if you listen to a lot of bass-heavy and\/or high-tempo pop\/dance or hard rock type music.\n\nThe AKGs are particularly exquisite if you are into midrange-dominant music like jazz, classical, or vocal music: instruments and voices come across with remarkable realism in tonality and timbre, and quickly become very addictive.  Whereas on the Grados the midrange seemed rather thin and recessed, and overshadowed by the treble and bass.\n\nSo really, it all depends on your preferences.  The physical comfort of the AKGs is less subjective, however: they are easily the most comfortable over-the-ear phones I've ever tried.  This is a HUGE factor worth considering.\n\n4 and 1\/2 stars: 1\/2 star deduction for the vinyl-covered earpads heating up my head, but I probably should've ordered the K240 Mk 2 version which come swith the velour earpads instead...kind of wish they had come with more breathable foam earpads like the Grados instead, but I imagine AKG chose not to because these insulate the sound better and form a better seal which allows for more bass.\n\nSpeaking of which, you'd have to be a total BASS-HEAD to say that these babies don't put out enough bass...I find them to have MORE than adequate bass, and it's nice tight accurate bass not the sloppy boomy kind that teenagers are generally used to and have blaring out of their cheesy car subwoofers.\n\nLast point: sound leakage with this \"semi-open\" design was far less than anticipated.  You can only hear the music if blasting it; at casual\/comfortable listening levels they were fine...I tried it out in a public library.  Certainly far less leakage than the Grados.  Haven't tried them out in a noisy environment yet to see how their sound isolation compares to my in-ear headphones, but that's not a fair fight anyway...I probably wouldn't recommend taking these with you on a flight!","summary":"Excellent for the money, might be all you ever need","unixReviewTime":1373500800,"vote":3.0,"style":null,"image":null}

I'd recommend these, and they cover your entire ear, I know it says semi open but it covers the entire ear and they are super comfortable too.

The cable is shot.\nDown to the wires, just a matter of time before I step on the cable in the dark and they are gone.  Time to update.  Decided on these cuz I Love AKG, best studio heads I know.\ncan listen all day without fatigue.  These have a mini plug, my video cameras need them. I hate most adaptors.  Mini has become more standard.  Zoom uses it.  So I got my order yesturday and tired them. A\/Bed them to the older headphones.  Much more dynamic range.  I was surprized.  Spent about twenty minutes comparing, then packed away the 92 versions.\nThese are good low level Pro headphones.  I'm happy.  I'm seldom happy with products cuz most so called pro stuff is really consumer plus or kids in garages.

To be truthful, this was never a particularly durable headset, but the old models made in Europe were head and shoulders above what AKG is shipping now.  They feel flimsy coming out of the box, and the product I received has a poor solder connection internally that makes the right channel audio cut out when you turn your head.  The plastic ear cup is already partially cracked and I've used them for just two months in studio.

People who are mixing or editing sound prefer \"accurate\" but many music listeners prefer the accentuated bass.  These headphones let you hear what is on the track an add nothing to that.  The sound is transparent, as if you were not wearing headphones.  Also being \"semi-open\" this means they do not block sound in either direction.  This open design adds to the not-wearing-headphones sound but is not practical in some settings.  Remember these are STUDIO headphones.  They provide accurate sound for engineers and are best used in a quiet studio setting.  If you are a music listener at home then the best use of these headphones is for classical or jazz in a quiet living room.  or for critical listening to any music, for example recently I was trying to listen to Paul McCarney's bass guitar lines in some new and old recordings. With these I can hear every note and also how he played the strings with his fingers.  The K240 provide an accurate, reserved sound for that kind of listening, not the popular flashy and thumpy sound.\n\nSerious headphone users will find they need several pair but one pair should be these.","summary":"Very accurate sound but not for everyone","unixReviewTime":1306886400,"vote":2.0,"style":null,"image":null}

I had 2 pairs hooked up to the recording station, including these. The other was a Sony 700DJ heapdhone. The Sony's sounded really dead. Like something was off. Too much bass, not enough treble. There was no mistaking the accuracy of the playback of the AKG, since I was sitting right next to the instrument and performer.

They are still a decent buy, and I can't recommend another semi-open in this price range, but the closed offerings in the bracket are MUCH better options in my opinion. I'm talking about the usual suspects the MDR-7506 and ATH-M50 are my two favorites.\n\n----- Back to 2008 -----\n\nThese are considered the studio standard in circumaural open back headphones for good reason. The sound reproduction is excellent, with clear bass and midrange and a very balanced profile through the entire frequency spectrum. It makes me angry at how much I've spent on speakers and studio monitors, these do a better job at a fraction of the price.\n\nThey are circumaural they fit OVER your ears. I guess some people don't like that. I think they might change their mind if they tried these. If you're looking for a SUPRA-aural design look at the AKG K141\n\nI find them extremely comfortable. I have literally forgotten I was wearing them more than once. The suspension system adjusts automagically and is excellent. At first I felt a little unsure about the security of the hold, I've been using these mostly as monitors while recording guitar and bass parts, but they've made it through some pretty enthusiastic headbanging without getting dislodged. It also prevents almost all the banging and noise you normally hear when handling your headphones.\n\nThe ear pads are soft and comfortable and have a nice synthetic cover which feels like glove leather and has just the right combination of grip and smoothness.\n\nThey are semi-open. In this case it means that with no sound coming out of them they are basically aurally transparent but when they are on it takes a pretty loud sound outside to be noticeable. They are excellent at the job I use them for, monitoring a master track while laying down new parts, because you can hear yourself and the room sound pretty naturally and still have a high quality monitor with no bleed through to the mic'ed amps. If you are intending to use these for monitoring during vocal track recording you might want to consider a closed back design, these can be a little loud close up, The K271 is an excellent option with an ingenious auto-mute feature that work off the same magical suspension system.\n\nOther Cool Features:\n\nmini-xlr connector on cord - replace your mangled cord or make your own!\nfully rebuildable and modular - any component can be replaced if neccesary\n\nGripes:\n\nIt ships with a 3m mini-xlr to 1\/8 cord w\/ 1\/4 adapter, I think most people would prefer the coiled cord which they sell as an option.\n\nThe suspension may 'feel' a bit insecure at first, and the pads may wiggle a bit if you shake your head really hard. a manual tension adjustment on the suspension might be a nice addition.\n\nYou really need a case for your studio headphones. As far as I know there isn't one available for these.","summary":"Finally a product where 'Studio' in the name is more than marketing hype","unixReviewTime":1201651200,"vote":56.0,"style":null,"image":null}

This said volumes to me about the acceptance by the real professionals. Bought my first pair back then and have had them over the years, occassionally upgrading to newest technology model. I happened to be in the discotheque business back then and I bought AKG's for DJ use in all six of our clubs throughout the country. These are fantastic with full range of natural sound from lows to highs. Does not color the sound and they really kick if you loop them through EQ. Ain't nothin' better. I am so spoiled that sometimes I prefer listening to concert DVD's with these on rather than listening \"full room\" with my very expensive and well appointed home component audio system. And I occassionally go back to my original set of AKG's purchased in 1976 and they still sound awesome, although the rubber ear pads have become rather hardened and I cant wear them for long. My only complaint about this new pair of \"around the ear\" phones is that you tend to sweat a bit after wearing them through a movie. I also have a set of fairly recent model 141's that are the \"on the ear\" smaller pad model with very soft foam pads and I must say that I probably prefer them to the full ear enclosure, for that reason. Other than that, you can't beat the undisputed champ in headphone sound, and at an amazing price point for the quality of the sound.","summary":"There is no equal","unixReviewTime":1177632000,"vote":7.0,"style":null,"image":null}

Like a pair of glasses, you can become so accustomed to the headband that you almost forget you're wearing it.

The WH20XLR comes with a pair of windscreens and an additional cable routing clip.\n\nThe sound is what Shure is famous for: warm, with a natural presence that never sounds like the wearer is swallowing the mic.

We have run it through a variety of PA systems as well as a Roland KC-110 keyboard amp and the sound quality is consistently superb.\n\nComparing it to an SM58 this one is about on par. Neither mic is particularly hot and both do best when run through a mic pre amp, but for the small rooms we play this is not necessary.\n\nOne of the best points about this is it is comfortable and the mic itself can be adjusted closer or farther for better control over vocal quality. Also it is less apt to feedback. To me this is important in the small rooms we play because some handheld mics that we use are problematic in that aspect.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent wired headset that does a competent job with vocals in small venues. If you use SM58s you have a good idea about the sound characteristics, so that is not going to require much of an adjustment. Plus this mic is built to withstand a heavy gigging schedule (we use the original box to store it.) The latter is one of the main reasons why I awarded this headset five stars.","summary":"Real work horse and decent sound quality","unixReviewTime":1423353600,"vote":null,"style":{"Size:":" 3-pin Male XLR"},"image":null}

Once you get it adjusted right, it does stay well enough out of the way to work well for singing drummers.\n\nThe sound quality is just 'okay'.  It is a cheaper mic, so expect to have to EQ a lot of midrange out of it.  Do not expect very good low end response.  However, it will pick up very well and handles high volume singing (?) without breaking up or distorting.\n\nHandling noise is TERRIBLE on this unit.

Listening to these makes it evident that the engineers who worked on this product really made an effort to sweat the small details that make for truly good sound. The crossover network (the electronic circuit that transfers high frequencies to the tweeter and low frequencies to the woofer) is one of the most critical components in a good loudspeaker system, and it's not easy to get it right in a passive loudspeaker system - but the Alesis engineers managed to do it. The result is smooth imaging and sound dispersion through the midrange and into the high frequencies, which makes the sound seem \"larger than the box\" - you never hear a little wooden box, instead you hear a glorious expanse of sound filling the entire sound stage.\n\nI'd recommend these Alesis monitors not only to home recording engineers, but also for general music and TV listening. If you're used to muffled consumer-grade speakers, these monitors will sound a little bright at first - and then you'll notice how much more detail you're hearing in the music, detail that is obscured by lower quality speakers.\n\nThe Monitor One's have good bass response for their size, but this is inevitably limited by the 5\" effective piston diameter of the woofers. I added a budget Velodyne VX-11 subwoofer to extend the bass response of the Monitor One's. The subwoofer is set to roughly a 70 Hz crossover frequency, and about 8 o'clock on the sub volume knob. The Velodyne integrates very smoothly with the Monitor One's at these settings, and the overall sound is nothing short of superb - for a total budget of about $300 for both monitors and subwoofer! Outstanding sound on the cheap!\n\nI have not heard anything that sounds audibly better than these Alesis Monitor One's until you get to the Mackie HR 824's in the $1300 range - more than *seven times* the Amazon price of the Alesis Monitor One's!\n\nAs an aside, these passive Alesis Monitor One's sound much better than the active Alesis M1 Active Mk II monitors do. The active monitors use the same woofer and tweeter, and the active crossover network is even smoother, but unfortunately the M1 Active's have very sloppy, boomy, undefined one-note bass that ruins the otherwise smooth balance of their sound. A real pity.\n\nIn summary, if you're looking to spend under $1300 for a pair of monitors, check these Alesis Monitor One Mk 2 out. There's a lot to love about them, and not much to critique.","summary":"Likely  the best monitors under $1000 - and these cost under $200!","unixReviewTime":1284076800,"vote":29.0,"style":null,"image":null}

I used them for front speakers in a home theater sound system, for recording studio monitors, as stereo speakers in my home audio system, and I've used them as PA speakers for practice drum sessions. Except for a tweeter that blew about eight years ago (and Alesis was GREAT! providing a replacement tweeter) these speakers are still going strong. You will not find a more robust, better sounding pair of studio monitors for the money, especially at the sale prices being offered now (3\/4\/10). In fact, I just ordered my second pair of Monitor Ones on Tuesday. I've been overdue for a pair of the MK IIs, which are magnetically shielded. The original Monitor Ones are not magnetically shielded, something to keep that in mind if you're looking to buy used. You'll want a magnetically shielded pair if you plan on housing the monitors near a TV or computer.\n\nHere's an example of the Monitor Ones reproduction detail: I had my brother visiting one day. I sat him down about four feet away from the speakers and put on a Joe Satriani CD. We got to this one song and all of a sudden my brother looked up and said: \"Wow, that's the first time I ever heard that.\" He was talking about a little pic work that you won't hear on anything but a good set of near-field studio monitors.\n\nI'm know there are other excellent near-field monitors out there, and there's almost no limit on what you can spend. M-Audio are highly rated, and the new top shelf Tannoys and JBLs are $1,000 and $1,500, respectively.\n\nIf you're a professional recording engineer or musician, that's one thing. You can probably justify spending a lot more. But if you're in the semi-pro category or just an audiophile who wants the hear the music as it was intended to be heard, I don't think you'll be disappointed with these monitors.\n\n-seabgb","summary":"Excellent Studio Monitors","unixReviewTime":1267660800,"vote":4.0,"style":null,"image":null}

The speakers were going to be suspended on the wall of my tracking room and used as playback monitors for musicians to spot check their recordings. They weight a little more than 15 pounds each, so they are not light like most traditional bookshelf speakers. The cabinet is dense (laminated) particle board with a nice fit and finish. Good looking, but nothing fancy either. Since they were not going to be used as critical monitors in the control room or for mix & mastering cost was a serious factor for most project studio owners, isn't it?  The Alesis Monitor1 MKii's are a good, practical solution.\nUnfortunately, the first pair I ordered from Amazon arrived with one of the monitors suffering from a blown or defective woofer -producing an annoying buzz across most low-midrange frequencies.  I returned them using Amazons pre-arranged return\/pick up policies which was pretty hassle free (save those packing materials if you have the room or at least, until you're confident your purchases work properly) .\nThe replacement monitors worked as anticipated... these are excellent passive (yes, you need to power them with a separate amplifier) monitors - with very accurate sound reproduction for the low price and represent a great value.","summary":"Love can be better the second time around","unixReviewTime":1373155200,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

I'm the drummer and I sing lead and backing vocals.  I have always used a Shure SM58.  A sound man let me use a Beta 57 one night.  I thought it was much too \"bright\" sounding.  He basically told me that the only difference between a Beta 57 and a Beta 58 is the wind screen.  The 58 windscreen sets the element back farther, which takes away some of the harsh overtones.  I switched to a 58 windscreen and it is a perfect vocal solution.  Clear, bright but without any harshness.  I have a 58  where we rehearse (the Beta only comes out at gigs) and I can hear the difference.

So far I've put it through some use in both contexts and it's performed wonderfully.\n\nIn a live application, I've used it as a vocal mic- there seems to be some debate over whether this or the Beta 58 is a better choice for live vocals, and I'd say that having heard both used onstage, I like the 57A because it cuts through the muddiness of most small venues a lot better. If you're playing a killer sounding room like, I don't know... the Ryman, it likely won't matter, but in the brewery barroom that resembled a really crowded hallway that we played the other night it made all the difference in the world over even an SM58- it was nice to hear myself sounding more like myself in the monitor. I've also noticed a few musicians that I respect a lot using it, and even Obama had one in his hand the other night while giving a speech.\n\nIn my home studio, I've used the 57A to mic a snare (sounds killer, tons of snap and body), acoustic guitar (not bad at all, although I prefer an SDC mic here), and a guitar cabinet (sounds great.)\n\nOverall, I don't think you can go wrong with this mic. I'd like to add a Beta 58 to the collection as well, but after a lot of research I think the 57A is the most versatile of the two so if you're on a limited budget as most musicians are, I'd go with this. You won't be disappointed, and I'd be surprised if I find a dynamic mic that replaces it in my every-day, go-to gear case anytime soon.","summary":"All-Around Awesome Mic","unixReviewTime":1447718400,"vote":5.0,"style":null,"image":null}

The Shure Beta 57A is my first and only dynamic. I wanted a jack of all trades dynamic that was great in quality, great in sound and affordably priced. This is what I picked.\n\nVocal mics tend to have a general sound quality in common. They flatten the hills and valleys of your voice and brighten it up. Listen to network news broadcasts and you'll hear what I mean. Speech intelligibility and voice power improves because you voice becomes like a wall of sound that is stronger and brighter. Many cardioid condenser mics also do this, and part of the reason has to do with the cardioid construction resulting in diminished bass and an accented upper midrange.\n\nThe quality is very fine overall. Solid, thick-walled, metal construction. Paint is applied very evenly. The grill wires look thick and robust. Fit and finish are as good as you'll ever get.\n\nAs for sound, it's like I mentioned. Bright and powerful. I did A\/B tests with some condenser mics at the same distance from my lips, and it's obvious what voice mics do, and this one does it well. Note that it is billed as an instrument mic, but the only difference between the Beta 58A and 57A is the grill, if I understand correctly, which can result in a slight difference in sound quality.\n\nThe XLR male connector seems good (I've had mics where the XLR hole is too small for the XLR cable connector to fit in), not too big and not too small, so the drilling of the hole in the mic for the XLR connector is at the correct tolerance.\n\nPlosives are under control with this mic, as the multi-layered grill assembly does a good job keeping the air out.\n\nOK, now you're probably wondering what's not so good about this mic. Well, the one thing I don't like is that the grill is not aligned symmetrically with the Shure nameplate, either on a flat side or at a diagonal). Soes the grill screw on, or is it permanently mounted, or is it a clip-on? If it's a screw-on, then I can see how it's not aligned perfectly, you have to turn it to line it up.\n\nI wish the body was black, because it's less obtrusive in appearance.\n\nThe output is not high, I have to turn up the gain on my Focusrite 2i4 all the way to get the required gain, when speaking about 6 inches from the mic. But the specs say it's several db more sensitive than the SM57.\n\nThe sound is less smooth than an SM57, from what I can tell. This mic works best for male singers with a dull, dark timbre, as it will brighten and strengthen things up. It will certainly brighten and strengthen instruments, but it will sound different than the SM57 sound that everyone is used to","summary":"I wanted a jack of all trades dynamic that was great in quality","unixReviewTime":1416096000,"vote":8.0,"style":null,"image":null}

So far, it has proven itself and has exceeded my expectations. I am rather new to DJing with real vinyl which should be taking into account. But, while I was practicing, it never lost track while both cueing and when doing spin-backs and other things. I am not a scratch DJ, however, so I didn't try any of that type of stuff and the M44-7 seems to be Shure's recommended choice for scratching.\n\nCompared to my M97xE cartridge it is louder in both raw output and in the music being heard off the turntable directly. The latter bit is a clue that the M44G is probably a bit harder on vinyl than the M97xE. It is, a DJ cartridge, after all. Of note, it has a lower recommended tracking force than the DJ cartridges from other brands that I was looking at and Shure mentions it offers ultra low record wear. Still, I will continue to use my M97xE when I'm not DJing.\n\nThe overall sound of the M44G is just fantastic! The highs are pronounced and clear and the bass defined and boomey. I thought it unfair to directly compare it to the sound of my M97xE as it has seen more use and the needle is no longer new. Plus, I use it the M97xE with the brush down which can impact audio quality a bit. Really, a direct comparison is a bit silly anyway as the M44G is for DJing first. If you just want to listen to records, I would consider something else.\n\nAs a DJ cartridge, though, it really shines and certainly has my vote!","summary":"Seems to track well, sounds great!","unixReviewTime":1328140800,"vote":7.0,"style":{"style:":" Phono Cartridge"},"image":null}

Dowling","reviewText":"I purchased this cartridge for my Technics turntable. I listen to a lot of music from the '50s, '60s, and '70s. I was looking for a cartridge that would faithfully reproduce the warm analog sound from that era, and I also wanted something that would be very gentle to my records. I did a lot of research, and the M44G seemed to meet most of my requirements, so I purchased one and installed it on my Technics.\n\nI've been using it for about three months and I'm quite happy with it thus far. It's not the best-sounding cartridge I've ever heard, but I wasn't expecting it to be. It performs well on my old '50s\/'60s records. It tracks very securely at 1.5 grams. I tried running it at lower tracking weights but it skipped much more frequently at those weights. 1.5g definitely seems to be the sweet spot, and is still light enough that I'm not worried about it causing undue wear and tear on my records.\n\n(If you're unsure about the accuracy of your turntable's counterweight and\/or if you find it difficult to accurately balance your tonearm, do yourself a huge favor and get a stylus force gauge! It's a big timesaver and ensures accuracy.  I recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Signstek-Digital-Stylus-Force-Gauge\/dp\/B00E7MVP3S\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Signstek Digital Stylus Force Gauge<\/a>.)\n\nThere is some inner groove distortion, but that is to be expected when using a cartridge with a conical stylus. You may be able to mitigate this to some extent if you use an alignment protractor. I aligned mine using a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Technics-overhang-gauge\/dp\/B001EY982C\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Technics overhang gauge<\/a>.\n\nDon't be deterred by the fact that Shure markets this cartridge to DJs. The M44 series were originally intended as audiophile cartridges, and it was only in recent times that they developed a following in the DJ community. The M44G in particular is a VERY gentle cartridge and it will not harm your records the way some other DJ cartridges will. If you're a home audio listener and you're trying to decide between the M44G and the M44-7, I recommend the M44G. Not only does it track at a gentler weight, it also has an output that is more likely to work well with home audio gear. The M44-7 has an extremely high output and it might overload your receiver or pre-amp, causing distortion and clipping.\n\nAs far as audio quality is concerned, I would describe the M44G as warm, punchy, and a little bit retro (for lack of a better word). It seems to work well with rock\/pop\/jazz\/R&B from the '50s\/'60s\/'70s. I imagine it would work well with country music too. If you're looking for a \"bright\" cartridge with emphasized treble, it's probably not your best choice. My speakers are quite bright to begin with, so the M44G still provides me with very clear treble.\n\nIf you buy it, make sure you align it properly. Even though conical stylii are supposed to be more forgiving of improper alignment, aligning it correctly does make a big difference. The alignment instructions that come with the cartridge only apply to DJ use and should not be followed for audiophile use. Instead, use an alignment gauge that's compatible with your turntable, or use an alignment protractor.","summary":"Nice cartridge for \"traditional\" vinyl sound -- and it's NOT just for DJs!","unixReviewTime":1399075200,"vote":7.0,"style":{"style:":" Phono Cartridge"},"image":null}

Tozawa","reviewText":"If you're looking for a quality, compact stereo mixer to combine multiple audio sources and output to a single pair of headphones or speakers, this device works perfectly. Measuring roughly 5 inches by 3 inches, its construction is solid and surprisingly made in the USA. All of the ports feature a nice and tight fit and the knobs are silky smooth. It's powered by a power adapter which is included.\n\nIt has four separate channel inputs and two output options. Channel 1 is an XLR input with phantom power option (which you can turn on\/off). Channel 2 input is via RCA or 3.5mm. Channels 3 and 4's input are RCA. Output is via RCA or 3.5mm. There are more than enough ways you can set this up depending on your devices and needs. If you need to use 3.5mm, either as an input or output, you can simply buy a 3.5mm to RCA cable adapter.\n\nSome reviews complain about static, hissing, or lowered volume; I have not encountered any of these issues under normal use. As long as you are using quality cables and your source output devices aren't cheap, no audio issues should be encountered. I can easily control each channel's volume independently with no loss in audio quality. Turning the knob all the way down will completely mute the source and turning it up has more than ample volume (although this may vary a bit depending on the quality of your output device). The only actual hissing I can hear (using headphones) is when you get near max volume on the knob when all other channels are silent. At the volumes you encounter the hissing at, you would blow your eardrums out. Under normal use, you don't hear it at all.\n\nThere are obviously several ways you can hook this up. For reference, I am using it to connect the audio from my PC and the audio from my game consoles (PS4 and Switch) and have it all output to my headphones. In my case, the game consoles are hooked up to a Denon A\/V receiver and I am using the headphone output from it to connect to the stereo mixer. For the PC audio, I am simply using the front 3.5mm output and have it connected to the stereo mixer. From the stereo mixer, I have the output audio plug into an external headphone amplifier which then finally outputs it to my headphones. My headphone amplifier definitely helps with overall volume, but even without it, the stereo mixer has plenty of power to output enough volume even to my higher ohm headphones from Sennheiser and AKG. Even hitting about halfway on the knob gets too loud and about a quarter of the way is good enough for normal use.\n\nWith this particular setup, I can now get game sounds and if needed, I can stream music from my PC at the same time. Or I can use voice chat on the PC instead of using Playstation's party chat or the Nintendo Switch's currently horrible (non-existent) chat system. And of course if I just want one audio source, then I can simply turn down the knob on the stereo mixer to mute it completely.\n\nAll in all, this is an excellent compact stereo mixer which makes life easier if you have a setup requiring multiple audio sources outputting to a single headphone\/speaker setup at the same time. It works well as somewhat of an audio switcher as well without actually having to switch inputs or cables around. If this sounds like what you need, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product.","summary":"Works perfect for my PC and Game Console audio to Headphone setup (Listen to both at the same time!)","unixReviewTime":1501718400,"vote":2.0,"style":{"Color:":" Black"},"image":null}

I am quite certain that this particular guitar stand can be used for many different shapes, sizes and configurations of stringed instruments.  5 stars.","summary":"Gets the job done","unixReviewTime":1466640000,"vote":null,"style":{"Style:":" Hanging Style w\/ Saftety Strap"},"image":null}

This is a great stand for acoustics and for light- to moderate-weight electrics.  If that's what you have, I recommend it.  It works great with my Telecaster!  But it makes me nervous with my '73 Gibson Les Paul. The Les Paul is so bottom-heavy that it's too easy to tip the stand and guitar forward, and the pendulum effect of the free-hanging guitar takes over and it all falls forward. (Don't try this at home unless you're standing right there in front ready to stop the pendulum!) In other words, the design of the stand allows the guitar to hang too close to vertical, and if the guitar is extra heavy, it can be tipped forward with a relatively light-to-moderate bump from behind. Front-to-back and side-to-side stability is very good even with the Les Paul and even with pretty solid bumps. I'm no engineer, but I would redesign this stand with four legs, adding a second leg in the back, and increasing the backward tilt of the stand.","summary":"Great stand but makes me nervous with my heavy Les Paul!","unixReviewTime":1463875200,"vote":3.0,"style":{"Style:":" Hanging Style w\/ Saftety Strap"},"image":null}

The best aspect is that the instrument hangs from the neck and doesn't rely on a bottom part for the guitar to sit on. This is great for a guitar with an odd shaped bottom that won't sit well on those other stands. Also, the lack of that bottom piece is one less thing for your strap to get tangled up in when you need to change an instrument quickly. This stand is also tall enough for larger instruments like basses and acoustic guitars.\n\nSturdy enough for stage but they do take up more space than some other stands because the legs open nice and wide for more stability. They fold up compactly but are still a bit heavy to carry around and won't fit in your gig bag it that's what you need. The self-closing yoke is a nice feature which will prevent the instrument from being accidentally pushed off the stand by your clumsy drummer.

So solid, well padded and grips the guitar very nicely. If you have Gibson guitars or acoustics it really is perfect. There are two very minor concerns but not enough to take away a star. The width between the two \"holders\" is a tiny bit wide for Fender Stratocasters - the guitar sits nicely but you can't just plop it down on it like you can with a Gibson shape. You have to \"place\" your Strat in there and then it's fine. With acoustics it's great but I wish the bottom two extensions were an inch longer. The stand is also very solid for acoustics just wish the extension was tiny bit longer. All that being said, this is a great stand and better than most.

I missed Amazon's return window by 2 days, so I would apparently eat the shipping. I've emailed Ultimate Support. If they replace it under warranty, I'll probably just give it away, as I can't stand using it regardless of the defective height cam. I've ordered a third K&M Memphis Pro instead. Further update: Amazon came through promptly authorizing a return after emailing them as well. Ultimate Support customer support also responded very quickly with a suggestion to check that the lever pin was seated evenly (it was), and if not to send them a picture and a copy of my receipt- they would take care of it. It was very reassuring to hear from them so quickly; I emailed K&M about a defective stand a few months back and never heard back from them.\n\nOut of the box, I really like the simple design, easy opening and adjustment, and how compact it folds up. In use, though I find this much more flimsy than two others that I currently have. Every joint has more flex than I'd like. The other two I own have automatic gripping or \"locking\" mechanisms, which I believe are not necessary, given the angle at which the instrument rests (the force required to dislodge any of my instruments from the stand would certainly tip the whole stand over). This one just has an optional rubber strap which cleverly has a tab to hold it out of the way when not in use. I like the design, but for my basses the shape of the yoke doesn't work so well- it holds them fine, the problem is removing them the neck is sort of wedged onto the vee shape of the yoke, so lifting the bass lifts the yoke up too and you kind of have to jerk it free. The height locking cam, while a super simple and clever design doesn't hold very securely. But the joint flexes so much when extended fully to accommodate my 5 string Jazz basses that when I set the bass down, the weight isn't pushing directly down on the lower portion, so it doesn't appear to slip. But the stand is brand new, and I imagine the cam will only get weaker, as it is plastic, and it latches against the metal tube. I'm not sure this is by design or if mine is outside manufacturing tolerances. This and the flimsiness may cause this one to be sent back. I should note, it doesn't appear the flex in all the joints weakens its stability much. In fact it could potentially make it more resistant to tipping. But to me it suggests either poor quality control, poor materials, poor design or corners cut. Edit: given my defective height adjustment cam, much of the flex I noticed could have been a result of that particular defect in mine. Overall, the materials and construction seem well thought out.\n\nI've been on a hanging stand buying spree of sorts lately. In the past month or two, I've picked up this one, plus an&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Ultimate-Support-17232-Guitar-Stand\/dp\/B005L0WZN4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ultimate Support 17232  Guitar Stand<\/a>&nbsp;(cheap double stand, sent back, totally unstable with just one bass on it and very cheaply made), two&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/K-M-Memphis-Pro-Guitar-Stand\/dp\/B0016ZT60S\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">K & M Memphis Pro Guitar Stand<\/a>s, and one&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Hercules-GS414B-A-G-Guitar-Stand\/dp\/B000EEHKVY\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hercules GS414B A\/G Guitar Stand<\/a>. I loved the first K&M, but the second had critical defects out of the box. The Hercules is very good, but is much bulkier than the K&M and Ultimate when folded (not including the non-folding yoke on the Hercules, I'm aware they sell one with that- in this case it is the girth and length of which I speak).\n\nIf it weren't for the flimsiness of this compared to the others (Edit: which could be simply due to a faulty height adjustment latch lever), I'd say it is very competitive with the other two- especially considering the price. The K&M is the lightest, most compact when folded, and the most enjoyable to use - however it is somewhat fragile (be careful not to open it too forcefully, or the height stop in the top tube will snap off). This one, the Ultimate GS100 is the second lightest, and almost as small folded as the K&M. I'd really like the way the legs fold on the Ultimate, if the joints didn't flex so much in use. The hanging yoke of the K&M is also my favorite, as the arms rotate inwards with weight applied, basically automatically adjusting for your neck width. For some necks, the Ultimate GS100 yoke may work better than it does for mine. Again, I think a simple yoke is all that is needed for most instruments on this type of stand. The number of moving pieces on the K&M appears much fewer than the Hercules yoke, and the arms of the K&M seem more durable too. The Hercules stand's frame seems the most stout with the least flex, and for mostly stationary use, it might be my favorite of these three. For packing in and out at rehearsal or the gig, the K&M is the winner for me, as it fits the front pocket of my bass gig bags (well 3\/4 of the way at least).\n\nBottom line on this one? Others have had great success with it, but having tried the other two, I can't say I'd recommend it over them. But if saving $10 or so is important, and you don't mind a little flex, or plan to use it with lighter instruments (my heaviest is just shy of 11lbs), this might not be that bad of a choice. It does fold up very nicely- and folds, unfolds very easily.","summary":"Compact folded, simple design, but a bit flimsy compared to others","unixReviewTime":1367452800,"vote":2.0,"style":{"Style:":" Hanging Style w\/ Saftety Strap"},"image":null}

I appreciate any reduction in weight when carrying gear to gigs.\n\nThe stand seems well built and sturdy enough as one would expect from Ultimate. I wouldn't worry about a guitar sliding off of it unless it was really bumped into. However, if you've got either a strap on your guitar or a cable plugged into it, one of these two will inevitably get caught up in the support arms and knock the whole stand over when you pick the instrument back up. I tried this over and over with acoustic and electric and the thing fell over because of this more often than not. The support arms are covered in grippy rubber and they do not \"clip\" into place. Therefore they sort of wander and are just begging to get caught on something. This doesn't cut it in a performance setting where you need to be able to pick up and set down your guitars quickly.\n\nIf you just need something with an understated look for home use (where you're not using a strap or plugging in), this might be a great pick. I'm just surprised that anyone would find it adequate for gigs. Mine's going back in exchange for another GS-100 which I've previously had and would definitely recommend for live use.","summary":"Not For Live Use","unixReviewTime":1363219200,"vote":10.0,"style":null,"image":null}

While that was a nice unit, it was simply too large and too heavy to carry around a couple times a week.  I would have gone SKB because I've had great experiences with them in the past.  However, after getting that last SKB rack, I wanted to get the smallest and lightest rack I could find to mount my guitar equipment.\n\nFirst off, this is a shallow rack (14.5\" from the front rail to the rear panel), but not as shallow as the shallow SKB units (11\").  This is great, as I have a Furman PL-Plus C, which would not have been an option for their shallow-mount cases.  Point: Gator.\n\nThe overall construction of the case is as expected.  It'll be durable enough to carry around your equipment, but something probably wouldn't survive a 6 foot fall.  Other reviewers commented having plastic shavings inside the rack?  Not the case here.  It also comes with a bag of screws with rubber washers (nice), which I didn't really need as I already have a ton of these, but a nice touch nonetheless.\n\nCarrying it is a breeze.  Because it's lightweight and shallow, carrying a full rack (unless you have heavy tube pre\/power amps) is completely manageable.  The handles feel nice and durable, but I'm only hauling about 30 lbs. of equipment.\n\nSo here's the bad stuff:\n\nThe rack's aluminum borders on the outside of the rack runs to the inside of the case, and is punched with holes for the rack (it's a single piece of metal).  However, the actual rail is a secondary piece that requires screws to be in place to keep it in that sits behind this piece.  It's not a huge deal, but if you aren't paying attention, all your rack equipment will be mounted sideways.  I almost returned it when I realized everything was sideways, as I thought this was a huge quality control issue, until I realized it could be fixed by loosening the screws, pushing the equipment in the desired direction, and rescrewing while holding it in place.  It's a bit irritating, but that should only ever happen once with this case.\n\nAlso, while this unit boasts front and rear rails (which it has), I found that one of the four rails was very poorly drilled.  I actually cannot put screws in about 75% of the positions on one of the rear rails because there is no threading.  Thankfully, the only thing I have to mount on the back was a 1U patchbay, and after rotating the bad rail, I was able to install it successfully.  You might also notice the rails look like a drunk 17 year old drilled the holes.  Once equipment is in place, it's fine, but its a little off-putting at first.  You could always upgrade the rails if you so desire, but if you can get everything mounted, it doesn't really matter.\n\nSo because of the issues with the rails, this only gets 4 stars.  I'm happy with my purchase, but I'm not happy with the quality control of this unit.  Thankfully, for how I will be using this, it doesn't affect me, but your mileage may vary.","summary":"Great case, but watch out for the rails!","unixReviewTime":1429142400,"vote":5.0,"style":{"Size:":" 6U Rack Space - Shallow"},"image":null}

They're only semi-circles and they really dig into your hands, even though I always carry this with someone else on the other side.\n\nThe second complaint is kind of a catch-22....I think there should be a model that does NOT feature the lock and key. It's a nice touch and idea, but in the case of this rack, when you're putting the covers on or off for transport, you have to tilt it away from you to get the bottom tabs of the covers in or out of their slots. Takes a little more time, effort, and care than you'd want\n\nIf you need the locking capability, this is a good idea. But keep that in mind if you're really going to load this--for me, this is loaded with around 60 pounds of equipment, and only about 15 of that is on one side, so one side is somewhat difficult to take the cover off.\n\nNo problems with dents or actually mounting the equipment, though--this is rock-solid overall.\n\nIf you aren't going to be loading this with lots of heavy equipment, I definitely recommend it. Otherwise? It's still a good rack, just consider the aforementioned flaws first.","summary":"Solid and gets the job done","unixReviewTime":1417910400,"vote":3.0,"style":{"Size:":" 12U Rack Space - Standard"},"image":null}

Just be sure you're okay with one this size.\n\nI was just starting out as a DJ when I got this, and it served me well until I had to upgrade to a 12U standard rack. Where I am, I couldn't find a place to sell this (not even Craigslist), so I ended up donating it to a school's rummage sale....not my happiest moment.\n\nAgain, if you think this all you need, get it; the rack itself is a great product. Just think ahead if you're a DJ. Me, I have two 1U mixers, a 1U power strip, a 2U lighting controller, a 1U rack, a 1U decibel meter, and some other stuff. I only expected I'd have about four or five of those things when I started and had this rack, so now I regret buying it.\n\nLike I said, though, NO problems with the rack itself.\n\nOne little note--the metal strips where the screws are is actually separate from the rack itself, so you need to keep a few screws in even when no equipment is in there.

Their durability is the best feature about them.  In fact the telelock mechanism is a great innovation too . . .\n\nHere's the \"BUT\":\n\nI have to give them a poor rating on a few accounts.  First & foremost is that these stands rattle, and not softly.  I have 4 of them, and they all rattle.  The frequency range in which they rattle is roughly 69-98Hz.  The sound clearly comes from the telelock mechanism.  Since all 4 of the ones I have do this it can't be coincidence, but instead poor design.  One of my stands has lost its \"grip\" to keep the pole slipping downward while the telelock is on the raise setting as well, but that's just 1 out of 4 (you may be wondering why I have 4 - I work as a professional DJ, and it's important to always have backups.  Therefore you always buy more than what you need.)\n\nHere's the other huge problem with these stands - Ultimate Support's support.  Currently I have a very nice rep working on the case for me who seems to be a little more proactive.  However, I called Ultimate Support over a year ago about the issue with the vibration in these stands.  I even sent an audio file to them where they could place a speaker on a stand, play the audio, and hear it for themselves.  I've had to call way too many times to attempt to get this issue resolved.  This is seriously unprofessional to drop the ball this badly.  Not only that, but I have another Ultimate Support product that was faulty from the start - a Jam Stand mic stand.  When I called more recently about my ts-90b's I also brought up that the Jam Stand was defective.  The rep assured me that they would just send me a new one since it wasn't worth it for me to send in the old one (admittedly it's an inexpensive mic stand).  It's been almost 2 months since the initial call was made where the jam stand was reported as defective, and I was assured I'd receive a replacement.  I have not even received a notice that a new stand was shipped.\n\nSeriously though, no follow up for over a year, and no resolution is simply unacceptable.\n\nAs stated earlier I have a rep who seems to be more proactive and diligent.  I'm hoping she will resolve this situation to satisfaction.  I will update my review after the outcome.

This one arrived first, sounds great, and is made in the USA so I didn't even bother auditioning the rest. The volume is nice and loud and I can even run it through my DJ controller's auxiliary input with plenty of volume (probably due more to the trusty Shure M44-7 cartridge that I use). Though it's all subjective, I noticed more definition through the whole spectrum of sound while using this device, as compared to running my 1200 through a Pioneer DJM-450 phono input. I'm half tempted to re-rip my vinyl collection all over again after auditioning this little preamp. Is it audiophile-grade? No, but it's more than good enough for my needs and would have to be better than any built-in preamp in any of the modern turntables available, or even most sub $1500 DJ mixers.","summary":"Affordable, made in the USA, I'm stoked!","unixReviewTime":1507593600,"vote":2.0,"style":{"Color:":" Red"},"image":null}

My complaint is in the machine tolerancing - specifically the screws provided don't work well when you install the equipment into the rack.

Everything mounted easily, and I've had no issues with the handle or moving the thing around.  I'm deducting one star because of the inconvenience of removing and replacing the front and back covers.  They don't just come straight off like similar SKB racks.  To install a cover you have to lift the rack off the floor or table, connect the bottom edge of the cover by placing it 1\/2 inch below it's final position and pulling it up into place.  Then you can fasten the latches at the sides and optionally set the key lock at the top.  To open it up you undo the lock and latches and then lift the entire rack off the floor or table so that you can drop the cover down 1\/2 inch to disengage it from the rack.  In my case (pun intended) the front of the rack is 100% full of equipment, none of which have handles or anything to grab that would make it easier to lift the front of the rack up in order to engage the front cover.  The back is not full, so I'm able to reach in and lift the rack without too much trouble to engage the back cover.  Getting the front cover off is a pain as the whole rack is about 40 lbs and I've got vacuum tube equipment that I don't want to bump around.  Since I don't typically use the locks, I'm considering removing the mechanism at the bottom of the covers that acts somewhat like a hinge to make the locks effective.

That's about the best thing I can say about the Beta 58.  It can take a beating and probably not fail.  The sound quality will suffer as several beat up Beta 58's I've used sounded like there was a rag wrapped around the mic but it got the job done in a pinch.\n\nAs I started working with other vocalists who brought their own mics to shows, I noticed that none of them really used the beta 58.  Most of them preferred either the EV ND767a, the Sennheiser e935a or the Sure Beta 87a.  The differences between these mics and the \"house 58's\" was astonishing... even 58's in very good condition (never been dropped or abused) did not sound as clear as the EV\/SENN's.\n\nThe biggest difference though is the feedback from stage monitors.  The Senn and EV both have much better feedback rejection than any of the 58's I've seen.\n\nAll in all, I've been pretty underwhelmed with the 58.  For around the same price there are much better choices.\n\nI know that different venues, singers, PA setups, different stage monitors, etc all can affect how a mic performs but my observations are based on hearing pretty much the same traits over and over so they are not based on isolated incidents and I also base this all on the performance of new or like new 58's, not the beat up ones.","summary":"Overpriced and under-performing vs the competition","unixReviewTime":1430784000,"vote":3.0,"style":null,"image":null}

I can't even recall when I began using them, around the late 70's. It was rare to find a stage that didn't have any SM58's on it.\n\nSomewhere back around the early 80's neo-d was being used in audio magnets to increase the amount of magnetism per unit of weight. In speakers, this would hold the voice coil tighter providing less movement, and this accomplished one major thing. The ability to use rubber surrounds in ported cabinets, allowing the backside of the cones frequencies within the cabinet to escape at a tuned frequency range, unlike the old sealed cabinets. One reason for the sealed cabs was that the air pressure within the cab kept the cone from over extending and now this could be accomplished with a stronger magnet.\n\nHow does this relate to this microphone you ask? It doesn't, except for the potential of micro gram weight reduction or higher SPL handling capabilities, and that's my point.\n\nIt was time for the big selling vocal microphones to get an upgrade and the popularity of neo-d was something that the manufacturer's could market.\n\nSo they took the popular SM58 and improved on it.\n\nThey tightened up the pickup pattern. This reduces feedback from the mic and those monitors that are only eight feet away, and that you can never get loud enough.\n\nThey improved the frequency curve. I've run sound at small clubs to outdoor concerts and you are always trying to get vocals to cut through the mix, without being completely on top of it. Just a little gain placed strategically in the high mids and the proper cut will accomplish this and Shure knew this.\n\nThey improved the capsule isolation. Even a mic on a stand needs this, it's how you will get low end feedback, because the vibration traveling through the floor will also travel up the stand and start the feedback loop. As a hand held, the microphone moves about in your hand or you switch hands or for whatever reason, this will decrease the noise of handling the microphone.\n\nFinally, they increased the output of the microphone. This is mostly needed when it's plugged into a poor input. But the sly devils could use this as a benefit of neo-d and why you should upgrade to the new Beta.\n\nThe original can actually have a preferable frequency curve for thin vocals, because it will naturally fatten them and many users won't need the extra gain of the Beta. Neither of these are reasons not to buy the Beta though.\n\nBecause in every way, the Beta is a superior design when compared to the original. When you purchase a vehicle you know darn well that the cheaper model will get you back and forth to where you are going and that the more expensive model will please you even more while you're doing it.\n\nThe only downside to the Beta is the cost and that it might actually be a better mic than what you need.\n\nAt a cost of about 35% more, you just have to decide which vehicle you'd rather drive and which microphone you'd prefer your vocals coming from. I prefer the newer design, but a microphone is a tool that I've used for over 30 years to make a living.\n\nRecommended","summary":"How To Improve An SM58","unixReviewTime":1423526400,"vote":3.0,"style":null,"image":null}

The SM58 is a good all around mic - the reason it's an industry standard\/go-to, but the Beta 58A is a better (in my opinion) vocal-specific mic...basically giving (again, in my opinion) a higher quality sound. The SM58 by comparison sounds muffled\/muddy, where the Beta58A is clearer, stronger, and more articulate. If you're used to the SM58, then the Beta58A can sound thin and harsh, but, that is adjustable at the board - end result is that it's a tighter sounding mic with more clarity.\n\nPattern-wise, it does better at rejecting unwanted sounds - I play drums and use this mic for that reason, is that it picks up less of my drums than a SM57 or a SM58.","summary":"Built like a hammer.

As a general purpose workhorse for live vocals they are by far the most popular tools out there. Quality venues throughout the country commonly stock these as their go-to house mics. In fact, I noticed Betas all over the place at a small theater (with a high-end system) that I played at just recently.\n\nI had used the old 58 for years before moving to the Beta and there is certainly a noticeable difference between the two. The Beta is definitetly hotter, with a more sensitive response. Your vocals will cut into the mix strongly and with more clarity than you might be used to. Mids and highs are picked up perfectly when singing a few inches away and there is a subtle low frequency roll-off to avoid that boomy, muddled sound you typically get when hitting low or quiet notes up close. You definitely need to stay within a close range though as the pickup pattern is very tight. This is a good thing because extraneous noise and feedback is effectively rejected.\n\n\"Built like a tank\" is probably a bit overused when describing products but Shure's vocal mics truly earn that title. They can take an enormous amount of abuse and never falter. Toss it around, drop it, bury it under other stuff, etc., NO problem. When you are maintaining a bunch of music gear, it's nice to have tools that you never worry about. For that reason, I'd highly recommend getting a used one if you can find a deal. Chances are, its in working order no matter what.","summary":"Rock Solid","unixReviewTime":1327449600,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

The Beta 58A is an amazing dynamic microphone that might alleviate some of the stress associated with its more cost efficient cousin. That is, the Beta 58A, in the confined live scenarios in which I have utilized it, has demonstrated a much broader sweet spot and completely eliminated some severe feedback issues. For vocalists that like to pull back from the mic a touch to really belt those sustained high (or, really, any) notes the Beta is a dream. This same effect helps if one is experiencing sibilance or \"popping\" complications and needs to sing past the microphone as opposed to directly into it.\n\nWhile I wish that I had a better understanding from a sound engineering standpoint so that the technical specifics could be expounded upon, I can confidently say that the Beta 58A is the best vocals microphone that I have ever utilized aside from higher end condenser mics in an isolated environment. Quite honestly, I would not be at all surprised if the Beta compared well even in confined recording situations. The bottom line is that the Beta 58A might be more expensive than its popular cousin, the SM58, but it is worth every penny. Anyone who has the opportunity should give it a chance to demonstrate its superiority.

The guitar barely fits and there is a weird need to make sure she sits exactly flat or the case won;t close.

But the DM80 is, and I know this sounds weird, fantastic for live vocals. I randomly tried it one night at a bar gig in an impossibly muddy-sounding room where even my Shure Beta 57 wasn't cutting through on vocals, and it instantly stood out. You have to scoop the mids and boost the highs a bit (but not as much as you'd think) and suddenly the average male tenor voice just jumps out. The mic also defies proximity effect and has a pretty wide on-axis pickup pattern, which is great for singing with your eyes shut (singers tend to wander from the mic when they do this) and for vocalists who think it's sexy to get their lips all up in the grill, which usually makes a 58-style mic go boomy. I got a lot of weird looks from people in the audience who know vocal mics, but I also got a lot of compliments on how present the vocals were in a room that is notorious for being terrible for understanding lyrics.\nThis mic also shines on upright bass- you have to use a LOT of gain, but with a nice preamp and some compression (I use a UA LA610) you can get a killer tone by placing the DM80 just to the right (facing the bass) of the bridge at the very top of the F-hole, and close in to the body. This is very nice for recording upright live in a room with other instruments because the null of the dynamic DM80 rejects outside noise nicely, and the lack of proximity boominess allows the mic to capture the \"wood\" tones of the bass without too much mud.\n\nI realize that this review is not really that helpful if you're just looking for drum mics, but the DM80 is a workhorse that will always be in my bag.

I had previously purchased their \"French Toast\" Octave distortion pedal and that one came with a \"knobs protector\", basically a clear plastic cover that slides down over the 'fins' on the pedal body to prevent the knobs getting trampled.  Well, this one came without the protector.  The instructions said to go to a parts website to order a cover but that was no longer available from the website. One quick email to Danelectro requesting one, and *POOF*  they sent a protector to me at no cost.  That's the kind of service that I appreciate and I will brag on Danelectro all day long.  Now, as for the pedal itself:  Works like a charm, just as good as a $100.00+ pedal from the big- name brands.  Sweet tremolo with a wide swath of depth and frequency.  Everything sounds good, from the \"Monkees Theme\" to Pink Floyd's \"Money\".  My next purchase is Danelectro's Cool Cat vibe pedal, and I will post a review for that too.  If it is even close to the Univibe it's worth it, since it is a fraction of the price of the big-names.  Also, keep this in mind:  The prices on Amazon are competitive, and sometimes they slaughter the competition of the \"Friendly Musicians\" website.

That's always the big question with these shaped cases. In fact there is a bit of extra room lengthwise so that I think I will add a piece of material to the top of the end plug to make things nice and stable. The case closes without any hint of it being too small and when I shake the case, I can't detect any movement of the instrument inside. That's what you want so that in case of major impact, the instrument is not damaged by the inertia of movement inside its case.\n\nIn fact, it's a good idea anytime you take an instrument outside the house and especially when transporting in a vehicle or if shipping it, to pack it judiciously with some extra foam or fabric. Not too much and not too little. If you use a cotton scarf or towel, that will also be useful to dry moisture that escapes from inside when playing and the like.\n\nWith this Gator case I like the ABS shell rather than fabric, the metal clip closures rather than zipper and the shoulder strap with its well-designed clips which puts the handle in just the right spot for me to be able to guide the case if necessary. This is not totally lightweight but considerably lighter and more maneuverable than my Gard case which I like but is a tank. I also like that this case is designed with little feet to sit on a flat surface although its body is curved. It will even stand upright on feet, which from experience I know is a good feature at a space-challenged situation. (Note I would stand it upright only when the instrument is not in it, say at a rehearsal, due to the inherent instability of that position. Or I might stand it in upright position if it could be securely wedged or roped to prevent a tumble.)\n\nAnd the price is right.","summary":"Fits my vintage Conn tenor","unixReviewTime":1374364800,"vote":null,"style":{"Style Name:":" Tenor Saxophone"},"image":null}

I have been drumming and writing music for 25 years, and have always wanted to play guitar. I almost lost my life a few years ago, and for my daughter to get this starter guitar for me as a gift for Christmas has absolutely changed my life! What a gift! I started lessons both on-line, and with a personal coach. Now for the review...I am a newbie, but I will try to stay away from \"guitar talk\/technical jargon\", or at least define the typical terms you might see in a review.\n\n1. The guitar has incredible action. This means how high the strings are set from the fret board and how hard you have to press down to play notes or chords. You don't need to press down hard at all, and anyone, even kids, should have no problem playing notes. Acoustic guitars are usually set with a higher action making them a little harder to play. It was pretty much in tune right out of the box.\n\n2. The guitar is BEAUTIFUL! I got the black bodied guitar. There is no pick guard (a piece of plastic that lays directly on the body of the guitar that protects it from scratches from the pick. Is that a con? It can be yes if you play it alot, you will start to see some marks from strumming. Not a deal breaker, this is a starter guitar.\n\n3. It wasn't quite staying in tune, and the strings seemed a little weak to me. I have MANY friends in music, and I took it in to Music-Go-Round where my friend works. He was blown away at the quality of this starter guitar! My guitar instructor was also blown away! That speaks volumes as both have been playing for 25-40 years, and both have many guitars. My friend just threw on a new set of D'Addario EXL110BT Nickel Wound Electric Guitar Strings, Balanced Tension Regular Light, 10-46, and it is now staying in tune. A new set of strings is between $5-$7, so not really a big deal. It is now staying in tune.\n\n4. Has a 3 way switch to change which \"Pick-ups\" are activated when playing. I have a Fender Deluxe 112 Plus Amplifier, and let me say, when I plug in this guitar, it just sounds incredible! It plays so well! The average person would not recognize that you're playing a starter guitar. My daughter got me the player pack combo which came with the guitar, a head stock tuner (a tuner which clips right on the head or top of the guitar and allows you to tune to the specific standard guitar tuning, EADGBE), guitar cable to plug in to an amp, a 10 watt amp, picks, a guitar strap, and a \"gig bag\" which is a soft case. An incredible value, and she got it right here on Amazon! I would recommend getting a hard shell case if you take your guitar places as a \"gig bag\" tends to throw the guitar out of tune. Not too much of a big deal because it came with the head stock tuner.\n\n5. It arrived very well packaged, they really protect the guitar, absolutely no damage. I have been so happy since getting this gift, and knew it was a good enough guitar to start lessons with an instructor. Definitely worth the money. If you are on the fence, take the leap, you will not be disappointed, especially for someone who is just starting out on the guitar journey.\n\nI plan on upgrading to a Gibson Les Paul in the future, one can never have too many guitars!

Additionally, when I used both outputs (direct and processed) the combined sounds were synthesize-sounding and way off from what I needed.

Conner","reviewText":"My high rating is not for the quality, but for the VALUE of these inexpensive guitars. With few notable exceptions, (i. e. hand made custom guitars) absolutely ALL new guitars require set up. Any reputable dealer should do some set-up before selling a guitar. Although when you buy a guitar via mail, you're unlikely to receive that service.\n\nBut even with a cursory set up, each guitar will change over time. Wood moves. It will expand and contract. Frets bulge from the neck. Someone will need to do those adjustments and minor repairs. Would YOU risk working on a fine instrument without the best tools and plenty of experience?\n\nMy reasoning is, EVERY kid who wants to play guitar also wants to modify it. I've been teaching for over 40 years. In all that time, almost every youngster or teenager puts stickers on his-her guitars, draws on them, tattoos them, refinishes or carves them! You wouldn't want them to do that to a fancy expensive instrument.\n\nAlso, every guitarist must eventually learn how to work on his guitar: restringing at a minimum, but adjusting action, making small electronic repairs or upgrades. Bolt-neck imported guitars like these (or Squire) are wonderful platforms for learning that craft without fretting about destroying a fine instrument. (Fretting... ha!)\n\nIf your young guitar enthusiast wants to learn re-fretting, that's much easier to do on a bolt on neck with no binding like this. Want to hear the difference between pro-pickups and these inexpensive imports? Swapping pickups is an inexpensive upgrade. Even less expensive is trying different capacitors or potentiometers. Your fledgling guitarists may become a computer whiz kid in the future. Some electronic knowledge and basic soldering skills will give him a \"leg-up.\"\n\nThe fact is, a good guitar technician can make one of these cheap guitars play almost as well as an expensive one. You won't have the bragging rights, but you will have a useable guitar that sounds good and inspires practice.\n\nWith just a few inexpensive tools, any kid can learn to level and dress frets. During that learning process, he will make mistakes, but those are also inexpensive to repair and provide a crucial learning lesson: NO ONE gets it perfect the first time. Only consistent daily effort brings improvement. What parent wouldn't want their kids to experience that crucial life lesson?\n\nIt is no longer speculation, but a well known fact that music lessons improve other scholastic scores because only daily practice improves any new skill. It doesnt matter if that skill is playing rock and roll, or practicing math. Do it every day, and you WILL improve. Learning music helps inculcate that great life lesson. Learning to fix and personalize your own guitar makes that lesson deeply engrained yet FUN!\n\nNO, as-is, this is NOT a great guitar, but it is plenty good enough for beginners to learn with. With a few tweaks here and there, these can be made to play as easily as pro-guitars so they don't hurt young fingers. And if you consider all the other factors in a child's development, these may be a better choice than funding an expensive guitar.\n\nOver the decades, I've repaired, adjusted and modified hundreds of student guitars and taught hundreds more how to do their own guitar work. That is one advantage electric guitars like these have over other instruments. You would not want a kid to mess around with a grand piano or a fine violin or classical guitar.\n\nFurther, the young student can express his individuality, learn to be self reliant, and learn the great lessons of relentless steady effort. Some may think sports provide some of those life lessons too, but with guitar, you don't risk critical injury or regular public humiliation. What could be better for your kids?\n\nThese and the Squire brand guitars are a great positive gateway instrument that brings life-long appreciation for music and craftsmanship. They can be a springboard toward learning electronics, circuit design and even some computing basics.\n\nIf you are clever and know an experienced guitarist \/ teacher, you or your kids can learn about economics, how businesses make compromises at different price points, and what is REALLY valuable in instruments. You might just learn what is valuable in life too.\n\nTHAT is why I love cheap guitars like these, and this particular model is one of the best for all those noble goals.","summary":"Great VALUE for decent quality, plus many other benefits to these cheap guitars!","unixReviewTime":1488758400,"vote":3.0,"style":null,"image":null}

I have used it with bass and guitar, and generally speaking, it tracks ok and if used with the right technique, you can get some cool synthish sounding tones from either bass or guitar. The weakness of the OC-2 is that you can't really add the extra low octave because it farts out and does not track in the lower registers on bass. With the OC-3, I thought that perhaps Boss had solved this problem. I found a used one that ended costing me 15 dollars with some other trades. With the bass, the OC-3 is muddier and harder to hear compared to the OC-2. I used it mostly on the poly setting. The lower notes track, but they all sound kind out of tune. The controls are just not that intuituive also. I am glad I kept my OC-2 because I will be going back to it as soon as possible.

I messed around with it long enough to know I don't have a regular need for it.  It sounded cool in an experimental kind of way, and I may find a use for it some day, but seemed to create noise at the lower frequency notes (...and that could just be my amp) and produced a lot of sounds (at various settings) that I thought were terrible.  As for the effect itself, I just found it hard to use it in a predictable way.  It was fun to play around with but every time I've tried to work with it, I find myself shutting it off to get to the sound I am going for.  I knew it would sound electronic, that's it's key trait, but just found it making things sound muddy, especially with the fuzz setting.  I don't like it's distortion feature at all.  I will continue to play around and figure out if I have a use for it but it will take a lot of effort on my part.  Not the kind of pedal that \"out-of-the-box\" blows you away, but not a terrible thing to have either if you have a niche use for this kind of sound.","summary":"Not Sure What To Do With It","unixReviewTime":1378771200,"vote":3.0,"style":null,"image":null}

Shippinhg was box within a box and the outer box was extremely heavy duty. The guitar...no rough edges, straight neck, no dings. Perfect condition. As I would have hoped, the strings were a tad loose, no problem. I'll be sticking to light strings as I haven't held a six string in over 40 years. All the hardware was tight with the exception of the toggle switch knob. This guitar is a great bargain for someone just starting out or getting back into playing, you get better than decent hardware and Gibson goodies.\n\nJust keep in mind this isn't a top of the line guitar but for the cost, seems to me to be a huge bang for your buck. I can recommend this guitar completely.\nEdit: Okay, got it home and tuned up, intonation is right on, action is good.

With that said, no, they are not that good of quality, and there tone is absolutely horrible. But I would still recommend them based on what your looking for.\n\nYour looking at 6 dollar strings, what could you possibly expect? Chances are your either a broke musician, such as myself, or working on a project 12 string and trying to minimalize cost when going into it. For the 6 dollars, and the fact they are eligible for Prime(or super saver shipping) they are worth it.\n\n12 string guitars are expensive to maintain, that much is very true. You need a new bridge from time to time, a sturdier case, and the cost of strings is usually around 20 dollars for a decent set. The problem lies in the fact that very few people play a 12 string anymore for serious music. That makes it incredibly hard to justify spending the extra money on strings. 12 strings now are used primarily for people either recording and looking for a unique sound, or just messing around with one in your local coffee shop. If you are looking to record, go elsewhere. Drop about 15 more dollars and get yourself some Elixirs or higher end Martins and get something that resonates. These sound dull almost immediately out of the package. But if you are in the second camp, and just want something that plays, then these are an excellent solution.\n\nAll in all, I knew what I would get. I did not expect much, and I did not get much. If your thinking you just found one of Amazon's hidden gems though, you did not. What you did find however, is an excellent set of strings for simply playing, either for yourself, or with a group. Just keep in mind that these are cheap strings, and you will not regret the purchase.

It's really not bad and it's a solid beginner's guitar with some room for improvement.  I found the neck to be decent, the pickups workable, and overall build pretty solid.  But that's it.  For nearly $300 you get a decent guitar that nearly every other beginner ever has used at some point.\n\nAll of which is fine, and I could end my review here.  But odds are, if you're seriously looking at this guitar, you're a beginner or intermediate player, perhaps looking for an upgrade from your Squier Bullet Strat or cheap Wal-Mart acoustic.  This is an extremely popular model because it's made by a subsidiary of one of the most famous guitar companies in the world.  And if you're like I was at one point, you might not have even heard of any of the comparable alternatives.\n\n1)  Schecter\nI own a Schecter Omen 6, purchased at $300 even, and it blows the Epiphone out of the water in terms of speed, playability, and sexiness.  It could have been the luck of the draw, but I do feel that Schecter makes a superior guitar at just a fraction of the cost more than this one.\n\n2)  Rondo Music\nIf you are indeed a beginner, you probably haven't even heard of Rondo Music.  They aren't as well known because they spend nothing on advertising or brand naming.  All that money saved goes directly into quality, and boy does it show.  You have two general groups of options if you're looking for a Rondo alternative to the Epi LP-100:\n\na)  SX Callisto (or other SX) - SX guitars are made in China and can be found ridiculously cheap (the most expensive custom models top out at $200) and will likely match, if not outperform, the Epiphone and save you $100 as well.  I just ordered an SX Callisto Custom at $160 yesterday - it has a set neck compared to the Epi's bolt-on, block inlays compared to the Epi's dots, quilted maple top compared to the Epi's plain top, and at under 2\/3 the cost.\n\nb)  Agile - Rondo's Agile guitars are less common than Epiphones, but have developed quite a cult following, for good reason.  An Agile AL-2500 series guitar (see pic) costs between $250 and $300 and will typically match an Epiphone Les Paul Standard Plus top, which runs about double the cost.  Go even higher up, and an Agile AL-3200 will compete with Gibsons and Fenders - without paying for the name (or American labor costs).\n\nThis isn't to trash the Epiphone.  It's a decent guitar and generally quite solid and reliable.  If brand name means a lot to you, then by all means, get the Epiphone.  I simply feel that you're putting at least a hundred dollars into the name on the headstock, and that there are definitely better alternatives at the price that you should check out.\n\nQuick takeaway - Unless the name on the headstock means everything to you, an Agile AL-2500 is a far superior guitar at about the same price.\n\n(Absolutely no compensation was given from Schecter or Rondo music - I just happen to like their products and wanted to share some advice to make the world a better place!)\n\nHope I was able to help you out, good luck with all your guitar endeavors in the future :)\n\n- Matt","summary":"Not bad - much better alternatives out there for the price","unixReviewTime":1456185600,"vote":15.0,"style":null,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/41gB9bGDoPL._SY88.jpg"]}

But it got old and I wore the frets out so I needed a new cheap guitar for rocksmith. I picked up the LP special 2 in black at Guitar Center for $130 and they kicked in free strings.\n\nBought it for a game, but soon found myself using it more than my other guitars because it sounded so good, played so well, and had a killer tone.\n\nMy LP Studio had it's pickups replaced with the Zakk Wylde 81\/85's which made for good metal but it lost some of that bluesy tone that passives have. Imagine my delight when my inexpensive epiphone had great sustain, tone, and playability. Considering this thing is almost the same prices a Bullet Squier, it is easily twice the guitar for that price. You literally cannot find a better guitar for $150 than the Special 2.....\n\nSound: 5\/5\nTwo passive humbuckers have a great sound with glossy highs, deep lows, and they put just the right amount of dirt on a tone for a gutsy clean or distorted sound.\n\nThe pickups were wax dipped and did not have the microphone feedback effect.\n\nThe pickups are high output and feel like AlNico more than Ceramic. Not sure which they have.\nSo much sustain for a bolt on neck. I was shocked.\n\nBuild Quality 4\/5\n\nI did have 1 problem with the high E tuner. I didn't notice in the store but the string peg was 1\/4\" up out of the headstock. When I discovered this I loosened the string, whacked it with my fret hammer and it popped right in and stayed that way.\n\nIntonation required no adjustment.\nAction was exactly the way I like it\nNeck was straight with no fret buzz or excessive bow.\nThe finish was perfect. No nicks, blemishes, just oily black goodness.\nNeck was flush with no gaps or seams, and professionally shimmed. Damn good for a bolt on.\nHardware is typical for the price but does the job, stays in tune very well.\nBack bending headstock and 3x3 orientation mean no string trees which makes tuning much more stable.\nThe bridge is similar to my LP Studio with the tunamatic setup. Individual strings may be intonated but action is done with two nuts, IE can raise one side higher or lower but not individual strings.\nWeird having the toggle between the volume knobs but I soon got used to it. No pickguard and it doesn't need one. Lots of relief between strings and body. You won't find yourself hitting the pickup housings or body with the pick. Makes it easy to clean too!\nTruss rod is behind a nice body color plate.\nFrets were smooth, rounded, and played nice. Could use a little buffing for silky smooth but not rough.\nNeck plays fast but the nut took some getting used to. I would catch it on my hand when fretting at the top, soon got used to it and it wasn't an issue.\n500k pots and side body 1\/4 TRplug keeps the cable out of the way.\n\nOverall 5\/5\nCame with hex keys for setup\nCame with an awsome poster with all the Epiphone guitar models\nCame with a nice bumper sticker\nNo manual\nBody was packed in foam shroud with foam blocks, about the same as any other $150 guitar.\n\nSummary: This guitar is the best bang for the buck of any instrument I own. It sounds good enough to gig with out of the box. IT's well built, plays well, and if you treat it well it should give you years of great music. The frets are medium jumbo's and a little deeper than a fender meaning they should last longer before needing re-fretting than a typical Affinity or Bullet (2 squiers in this price range).\n\nI would say this guitar is suitable for all styles of music. I did blues, metal, country, and pop. The pickups are humbuckers which means they are darker and higher output than a Fender, not as much of those nice Fender bell like tones and chime but it makes up for it with power and clarity.\n\nOne thing I like about Epiphones and Gibsons is the volume pot is not close to the bridge. This makes it VERY easy to palm mute and play with high gain. I lay my pinky and the knife edge of my hand lightly across the strings right where they hit the bridge and it makes a nice mute but on my Strats the damn volume knob is in the way.\n\nAs an experiment I took the pick up pole scews out of the bottom pickup to see if I could get a single coil sound out of it. What happened was a mess because of the parafin wax which got EVERYWHERE. The tone was a little brighter and output a little lower, still no hum but you wouldn't fool anyone into thinking it was a single coil. I ended up putting the screws back in.\n\nI will likely put my LP Studio stock pickups back in (hell yeah coil tapping here I come!) and move my EMG 81\/85's in this LP Special 2 and make myself a nice little metal guitar.\n\nDo yourself a favor, buy this guitar even if you already have a better guitar. It's cheap enough that you won't care if you bang it around a little, and good enough that you will enjoy playing it for many years.","summary":"Almost as good as my LP Studio deluxe plustop!","unixReviewTime":1389398400,"vote":5.0,"style":null,"image":null}

First of all it has two wonderful humbucker pickups (at the bridge & neck), separate volume & tone controls for each pickup and of course the classic Les Paul 3-way toggle to select bridge pickup, both Bridge & neck, or neck pickup. It has a bolt-on neck (rather than a glued neck) which IMO is not a bad thing, it is a bit thinner than your typical Les Paul which makes it light (a good thing). Still for the $250-$300 usually paid for a Les Paul 100, you get proper tuners (which are very good) a nice finish (mine is Hertitage Cherry Sunburst) and the wonderful Les Paul sound in a well-constructed, nicely-crafted guitar. The 12\" radius neck feels wonderful, and I found no sharp fret-ends on the rosewood fretboard. All controls work just as they should (volume, tone, pickup selectors) and the tones this guitar is capable of are wonderful.\nThis is a guitar that although it is value-priced, it isn't and doesn't look, feel or sound 'cheap'. It's a guitar you can happily play for many years  and want to keep.\nWhat you don't get on this guitar that you might get on a higher priced guitar is as previously mentioned - a glue-on neck (this one is bolted on) fancy large inlayed fret markers (this has the usual dot markers common on many guitars) and binding on the body. The later two are more cosmetic than anything and doesn't change the fact that this guitar looks & sounds wonderful.\nI own many more expensive guitars, but I find that the Les Paul 100 is a very enjoyable guitar to play. My 8 year-old daughter refers to it as my \"pretty\" guitar, and indeed it is very nice-looking. The proof is in the playing, and this is a guitar that you won't want to put down. The lighter weight also makes playing very enjoyable and I've yet to experience a sore back playing (the weight is one of the reasons I choose this over other Les Paul models).\nDon't let the reasonable price fool you - this is a very good guitar that you won't be sorry you purchased -not a month from now, not a year from now & most likely you'll still be enjoying it years & years from now. It's that good & it's a great value. Highly recommended!","summary":"Wonderful Guitar - Wonderful Value","unixReviewTime":1428192000,"vote":7.0,"style":null,"image":null}

The pickups, tune-o-matic bridge and stop piece are the same ones used in Epiphone's more expensive guitars, and are similar to what's used in much more expensive Gibsons. Although the tone adjustments have been simplified to a toggle between the three pickup combinations and an overall tone control for both pickups, this is not as big a deal as many might make of it. Given the vast array of other things that influence electric guitar sound -- strings, amp choice and settings, effects pedals and so forth -- the guitar sounds great as is.\n\nThe finish and general fit and balance of the guitar are great. There was a time when budget guitars screamed cheap and were quite obviously low class in a lot of areas. Those days are past with the Epiphone LP Special II.\n\nAll that said, there a few things to remember.\n\n* The guitar comes with very light bendy strings. This is probably due to market data that tells Epiphone that the bulk of buyers for this guitar are teen Guitar Heros who think that string bending every note is an essential aspect of shredding and wailing. If you plan to put heavier strings on the guitar (like 12-51s for example) for jazz or other styles of music then you will probably need a truss rod adjustment to compensate for the added tension. If you don't know how to do this, ask someone who does. You can ruin a guitar, permanently, by being too aggressive with a truss rod adjustment.\n\n* The guitar has a mahogany neck, but a basswood body. Do not let anyone tell you this is a bad thing. Basswood is a completely acceptable wood for musical instruments. It is not worse or better than mahogany or maple. It is just different. Once again, the differences involved will probably be irrelevant when added into all the other things that players do with amps, strings and pedals to create tone and sound from an electric guitar.\n\n* Epiphone has more than one factory making these guitars. One is in China, the other in is Indonesia. The guitars made by each are very close in every detail, but not exactly, perfectly the same.\n\n* The Chinese examples of the sunburst model that I have seen have a slightly golden-orange tone to the sunburst pattern, more like the traditional sunburst color in American guitars. The Indonesian examples I have seen have a much more over all orange look. Basswood does not have a lot of visible grain. The example guitar shown in the official Epiphone product photos, the photos you see on most web sites like Amazon and Musician's Friend and so forth, are probably a little optimistic when it comes to visible grain and the golden hued quality of the sunburst finish.\n\n* The Chinese examples I have seen tend to weigh more. One Indonesian model I saw weighed a full pound and half less than the Chinese model right next to it. There is not, unfortunately, any way to tell from the box or from the barcode or SKU number on the box what factory a given example inisde the box came from. The system will deal out whatever is in stock at the moment.\n\nThe world is full of guys who will zero in on all the details they find inferior about this guitar by noting the rather obvious fact that this is not a Gibson Les Paul Standard costing $3,000.00. There are some people who will complain that this guitar has a bolt on neck. True, the set necks of the more expensive Epiphones and Gibsons are nicer. But, considering the fact that every Fender Stratocaster ever made had a bolt on neck, is this really a big deal? Would Jimi Hendrix have played \"Purple Haze\" better if his Strat had a set in neck? Probably not.\n\nThe guitar this model is probably closest to, in spirit and purpose, is not the Gibson Les Pauls but, rather, to the old Gibson Melody Maker guitars from the 60s. That said, this is a hell of lot more guitar for the money than any Melody Maker ever was, and adjusted for inflation, relative to what a Melody Maker would have cost you in 1968, for example, it is almost like Epiphone paying you to play it.\n\nPeople listen to music, not guitars. Music is made by players, not by pickups and electronics. If you're on a budget, this is an outstanding choice. If you're not on a budget, it's still a very good basic instrument.

I really love the Les Paul sound but my pocket book is not large enough for the Les Paul price.  I've read just about everything I can on these Epi's and finally went to my local Music store to try one out.  My initial impression was somewhat mixed.  The sound was good but the action seemed \"off\"  After playing a few scales and a couple easy chords I began to get a feel fro the action on this guitar.  Then I switched from the rear pickup to the front and BANG there was that sound I was looking for.  Classic Gibson Les Paul sound (in all fairness the amp was setup for a strat).  After playing around a bit more I asked to try one in the cherry finish.  They unboxed a new one for me and WOW this guitar looks AMAZING!  I sat down plugged it in and played a bit. Instantly I was in love.  The action was perfect (despite the some what heavier strings than what I'm used to).  The sound off both humbuckers was classic and playability of this guitar has to be tried to be appreciated.  Tuning is a breeze, and is held as well as any other guitar I own (I always retune before every session anyway).  Epiphone really did everything to capture that Les Paul sound in a economy guitar.  Yes I know you puriest will point to the bolt on neck, the cheaper humbuckers, the flat top construction, and the basswood body.  I point to the angled headstock, mahagony neck, rosewood fret board, and Gibson electronics.  I love the simple volume and tone controls (yea a little more knob spinning when switching between pickups) and the tun-o-matic bridge and tail piece is gonna make string changes a breeze (so much better than having the try to thread thru the body).  Even with my somewhat limited practice amp this guitar still sounds amazing, oh and the sustain from it well lets just say I hit a low E last night before I went to bed, and I think it is still reviberating in the amp this morning (lol  If your looking for a Les Paul sound at a discount price- consider this your answer. Oh and my local shop was able to give me this guitar at $20 less than any place else, AND they will do a FREE setup for me after I've played it for a while (so far it's been perfect out of the box).","summary":"Amazing sound...nice price","unixReviewTime":1317427200,"vote":7.0,"style":null,"image":null}

My particular instrument has some issues with the finish in a couple of places around the perimeter of the guitar - they look like black splotches underneath the sunburst paint and clear-coat.  There's one near the top strap post and another near the place where the pick-guard mounts to the underside of the body.  Neither would be apparent to someone who wasn't appraising the guitar, but they are there and don't look normal to me.  Maybe I got the first one off the line after they switched from black-painted models?  My guitar also has a weird V shape on the back of the neck where the wood grain doesn't match at all - I'm guessing that it's a joint that has been glued together.  I know that the better Les Paul guitars have a one-piece neck, and since I didn't read about this one having something different, I assumed it would be the same.  Glue is stronger than wood and Les Paul guitars have a tendency to break in that area, so I guess my guitar should be more durable than some. Still, it was a disappointing and unexpected discovery.  I'm not sure that seeing these finish issues before-hand would've dissuaded me from buying the same guitar, but upon reflection it would've been much smarter to visit a music store and examine the guitar before buying.\n\nMy remaining issues with the instrument have more to do with the general design of all Les Paul guitars versus my particular instrument.  The guitar is too small for me to comfortably play it without a strap, even while sitting.  The top strap peg is angled up slightly, where guitars with horns have them angled down, which means that investing in the install of a straplock system of some kind is a good idea with a Les Paul - the pegs just don't stay in the strap holes as well as on some other guitars.  It's great that this guitar has all the knobs and switches that \"real\" Les Paul guitars do, but from a practical standpoint it is rather cumbersome to have separate volume and tone knobs for each pickup.  The range of adjustment on the saddles is pretty small, and I found it impossible to setup the guitar for coated .09 strings without additional hardware.\n\nThe guitar sounds decent, it looks pretty great (although not quite as pretty as the pictured one), and due to its shorter scale length it is a tad easier to play than some other guitars.  Note: the shorter scale length is characteristic of Les Paul guitars, it doesn't indicate that this is less than a \"full-sized\" guitar.  Though this is a fine guitar for the price, I'm not sure that I would make the same choice if I were in the same position again.","summary":"My mistake for buying sight unseen.","unixReviewTime":1392854400,"vote":3.0,"style":null,"image":null}

I wish I had known about this model before starting my guitar journey with a Fender Squire Strat Pack - which is absolute garbage even with a proper setup. What I thought would be a step up from that pile was an Epiphone LP Special 2; while it isn't the worst choice it wasn't a good one. That guitar was a plank of wood and the tone reflected that. Stear clear of those models. They will end up in a closet gathering dust. They both suck to play and I really do mean that.\n\nThe LP-100 on other hand is VERY impressive for the price and would be a good starter guitar for anyone interested in learning how to play. Looks wise, it begs to be taken off the wall and played. The iconic sunburst finish really shines, doesn't look cheap at all, and can take a ding or two without showing. The sound is great, the humbuckers really sing, and the volume\/tone knobs are responsive. String changing is a breeze and adjusting the action is also very simple given the tail piece and bridge are easily accessible. You can get a wide variety of rich tones out of this when coupled with a decent amp - I used a Fender Mustang 2 and not some silly mini speaker. In fact, if you are buying this for a gift or as first guitar for yourself do get a Fender Mustang 2 at around $100 on here. One of the biggest blocks for learning can be things not sounding right, Part of the equation to having a successful start with playing guitar is a combination of good equipment at the start. My recomended setup for those I give lessons to:\n\n-Epiphone LP-100\n-Fender Mustang 2 amp (the bigger the better, don't buy some mini cheapo POS)\n-6ft Fender L-shaped cable for this particular guitar\n-Dunlop Gator Grip picks ,58mm thickness or one of the variety packs\n-Dunlop String conditioner - helps your strings last and helps condition the fretboard.\n-Fretfast - helps slick up the strings and back of the neck.\n-Ernie Ball slinky strings\n-Chromatic Tuner (or if you have a smartphone there is an app called G-Strings and you will save a boatload of money)\n-Floor or wall stand, brand makes zero difference until you're playing on some $1K+ Gibson.\n\nWith that equipment you get the feel and sound you want from your equipment to keep you moving along.\n\nI have some \"better\" guitars in my collection such as a Fender Telecaster and an Epiphone Sheraton 2 but I keep coming back to this LP-100. I like the way it feels, the tone, the presence that it has overall. My only complaint with this guitar is the stock tuners\/tuning pegs. It doesn't hold D or C tunings for as long as I would like but that is minor when considering the overall quality of this great guitar. If you buy this stellar Les Paul and keep it around, plan on upgrading the tuners to Grover tuners for around $20-$30 and an hour of your time.\n\nTo conclude my ranty review; you cannot go wrong with an Epiphone Les Paul 100. If you're a beginner, you will love it. If you're more experienced, it will be a nice addition to your collection and put some variety in your sonic arsenal.\n\nDo not buy a Squire or a First Act, start off right or you are wasting your money. The LP-100 is hands down the BEST budget guitar I have played. New or used, it is worth the money if you are serious about learning.\n\nGo forth and SHRED \\m\/","summary":"PERFECT Starter Guitar - and beyond :)","unixReviewTime":1376438400,"vote":73.0,"style":null,"image":null}

I took it out of the box and wanted nothing more than to give it 5 stars just for value alone. I'm still shaking my head in disbelief that I got this guitar for the price. First, the 'tuner' issues that I've been reading about. Replace the strings! I stretched and stretched these things and they would not stay in tune. A set of D'Addario 10's cured that straight away (or whatever you prefer just change them). The tuners aren't the best but they are not to blame, it's the cheap strings. Now, technically if you only play open chords this was playable out of the box. The neck angle was so off the A string rattled no matter how high I set the bridge. The guitar would not intonate due to the ridiculous angle. Yes I could have sent it back but I suspect I would have gotten another just like it. I had to spend about 6 hours shimming the neck AND the nut (Never had to do this to the nut on an electric, not even on a used guitar. The nut slot was cut too deep), as well as working on leveling nearly every fret to make it playable. It required 3 business cards to shim the neck which is the most I've ever had to use. After I got that straight I removed a bit of paint from the neck and set it with wood glue in the pocket and on all the screws. In my opinion this helps a great deal with these and all bolt ons for that matter.\nIf I bought this used none of this would have been a big deal. But as I'm looking at this horrid neck angle and doing all this work I'm steadily staring at the 'QC passed' sticker. Must have been built on a Friday afternoon or something.--- NOW--after I did this it is sweet!!. I play through a Peavey Valveking 100 and it rocks as good as my Strat w\/  Duncans and Dimarzios. The quality of the electronics is not sub par at all. After adjusting the pickups screws to match the string height and getting all the horrible wax off them,  I'd argue that this is as good as any Epi I've ever played as far as pups and all, so don't hesitate there because I don't really care for Epis and I'm in love with it. (I bought this to sell mainly, but now????)  The build quality; hmm, if you can do guitar work go for it. Otherwise I'd highly recommend a more expensive model.

With that said, no, they are not that good of quality, and there tone is absolutely horrible. But I would still recommend them based on what your looking for.\n\nYour looking at 6 dollar strings, what could you possibly expect? Chances are your either a broke musician, such as myself, or working on a project 12 string and trying to minimalize cost when going into it. For the 6 dollars, and the fact they are eligible for Prime(or super saver shipping) they are worth it.\n\n12 string guitars are expensive to maintain, that much is very true. You need a new bridge from time to time, a sturdier case, and the cost of strings is usually around 20 dollars for a decent set. The problem lies in the fact that very few people play a 12 string anymore for serious music. That makes it incredibly hard to justify spending the extra money on strings. 12 strings now are used primarily for people either recording and looking for a unique sound, or just messing around with one in your local coffee shop. If you are looking to record, go elsewhere. Drop about 15 more dollars and get yourself some Elixirs or higher end Martins and get something that resonates. These sound dull almost immediately out of the package. But if you are in the second camp, and just want something that plays, then these are an excellent solution.\n\nAll in all, I knew what I would get. I did not expect much, and I did not get much. If your thinking you just found one of Amazon's hidden gems though, you did not. What you did find however, is an excellent set of strings for simply playing, either for yourself, or with a group. Just keep in mind that these are cheap strings, and you will not regret the purchase.

I've always wanted to get the Boss OD-2 because it has such a great and controllable classic natural sounding OD but it was discontinued.  I read about the OD-3 being a successor to the OD2 (with good reviews) and decided to get this pedal and just see how it fits in with what I do.  The OD-3 showed up a few days ago and I have been testing it out with it configured just about every way possible.  I like the tone at about 11:00 to 12:00 and the OD throughout the whole range.  I like the way it behaves (like a tube amp) with the notes still sounding pretty clean when playing lightly but growing dirty as you dig in harder.  I feel like this pedal completes the low to mid range of OD\/distortion where the other 2 pedals cover the other end.  I would definitely recommend this pedal if you like classic rock and highly manageable levels of OD from clean to pretty ragged.  The tone at 11:00ish is very good for letting the lower notes stand out while also keeping the high end clear.  Going back and forth (pedal on- pedal off) I have it set where the natural tone (clean on amp) is close to the tone with OD on.  Then I just set the level to about what the other OD\/Distortion pedals are at and then put the Drive knob wherever I feel like and it seems like it works for me throughout the entire range.  Some criticize it's limited range of output sounds, where I feel like that is what I want.  Something predictable and easy to find the one sound I am looking for.  I only use about 6 pedals and I like to be able to know them all well enough to dial in my favorite sounds quickly.

Coming two years on the heels of the popular BD-2 Blues Driver, the OD-3 didn't feature any bells and whistles.  It's yellow color and simple three-knob layout look like a combination between the venerable OD-1 and SD-1 overdrive pedals.\n\nPlug it in, however, and you'll find what is probably one of the most underappreciated pedals from BOSS.  Unlike the Tubescreamer and the SD-1, the OD-3 really works as a standalone overdrive pedal.  It does not cut out all of the bass in your tone, and can get surprisingly high-gain if you turn it up.  Perhaps most importantly (and unlike the DS-1 and SD-1), it has tons of output on tap - this thing can easily achieve unity gain with your clean tone, or boost your signal even further.\n\nDescriptions of pedal \"tone\" are very subjective and hard to convey in words, but the best thing I can say about the OD-3 boosts your tone and adds fullness and gain without sacrificing transparency.  Your guitar will still sounds like your guitar - only on steroids.  That's what a good overdrive should do.  I tried it with a Les Paul and it could handle everything from smooth blues to crunchy classic rock.  With a Stratocaster, however, it really comes alive.  You can get a lot of those great \"Stevie Ray\" or classic rock tones with a Tubescreamer boosting an already overdriven amplifier.  Or you can just plug in the OD-3 and get an equally awesome effect.  Pick attack is very well defined from note to note too - it's an analog circuitry, but BOSS really did some nice work under the hood to refine it.\n\nBottom line: There are a lot of great overdrive pedals out there in today's market.  If you want to pay $100+ for a Fulltone, Wampler, or even a Klon, those are very nice pedals.  But if you think the less-than-$100 OD-3 can't hang with those, you're kidding yourself.

Overdrive is overwhelmingly the most popular guitar effect these days; even more so than distortion. Unlike distortion effects, overdrive allows more transparency in your sound so that you can hear the notes and chords that you play much better than you could with distortion or fuzz.\n  Overdrive is a fairly simple circuit on the inside (especially compared to analog 'chorus' or 'flanger' effects), yet there are tons of overdrive pedals that cost well over $250.\n  When I decided to finally add an overdrive to my setup, I spend about two years trying out different options. I was in no hurry, and I wanted to get a really good overdrive no matter the cost. Some of them were expensive (the 'Klon' cost over $300), and some of them were much less. Unlike delay, modulation, and reverb pedals, in the world of overdrive effects, a correlation between price and quality isn't nearly as strong as you might imagine it to be. You could spend as much or as little as you want and essentially get a decent product. This is because overdrive is overwhelmingly the most popular effect for guitar players.\n\n  But try and imagine my surprise when I tried out this overdrive in a music store a few months back out of nothing more than boredom, and couldn't believe my ears! The OD-3 is an analog overdrive that retains as much or as little bass as you dial in, it's dead silent when it's engaged and you are not playing (the signal to noise ratio is '-115db'), the construction feels very solid, and it even features the classic early 80's larger black BOSS knobs with a funky school bus yellow-ish orange paint job all over it.\n  This is one situation where people will flat out refuse to like the effect because it's BOSS, and it's just not expensive (or hipster) enough at this point in the market. I have owned over a dozen different BOSS effects since I first started guitar and I think this one might by my favorite because it's just such a sleeper hit! If you are willing to take a chance at not being considered 'cool' by the 'boutique' snobs, I highly recommend that you try out this pedal.\n\n  I like to give other guitar players a blind listening test by putting a pillow case over this pedal and letting them try it out while I dial in the tone they are after. They all go on and on about the transparency, the big bass, the gobs of sustain; but then when I remove the pillow case and show them that it's a BOSS pedal they have been hearing: they usually end up screaming, stomping up and down, wetting their pants, and dismissing it with something along the lines of \"BOSS is just junk anyway!\"\n  It would be funny how biased some guitar players can really be if it wasn't so sad. I see it like this, I could buy any overdrive that I could possibly want and I picked this one over all the MAXON options (and there are a lot of MAXON overdrives). No other overdrive sounded near as good as this one and it just so happens to be one of the more affordable options available too.\n  I recommend this over the BOSS BD-2 (which is more aggressive sounding, and a bit too 'bright'\/'tinny') and the BOSS SD-1 (which doesn't offer near as much bass, and is a much more noisy pedal). BOSS really reclaimed their integrity with the OD-3, and I highly recommend it. Give it a shot!","summary":"Holy Cow! This is the best overdrive!?

Lay","reviewText":"I was really surprised when I got this, how heavy it is.  I knew it was all-metal, but still, it's built like a tank.  It is a classic, and you've heard this pedal used on many classic albums.  You can take the bottom off, and adjust the sweep on it really easy.  Just look up how to do it on Youtube.  It doesn't require any tools besides a screwdriver to take the bottom off.  You'll want to get an adapter if you don't already have one, because nine volt batteries get expensive fast and are bad for the environment.  They could have made the battery holder a little better.  It's hard to get the battery back out.  With my Mustang combo amp, this was the only pedal I needed, because it already emulated pretty much everything else in the amp's software.  Great combination, the two.  There are a couple other pedals I considered, The Bad Horsie sounds really good, too, with true bypass, but when I found out that if you took your foot off, it quit, that was a dealbreaker.  The Vox is really close, and Vox did invent the wah, but the crybaby just has a certain sound that gives it an edge, but it's a matter of taste.  Some people claim that it sucks the tone out of their guitar, but I can't tell any difference.  Robin Trower has a wooden block that he sticks in it to set it at just the right spot for 'Bridge Of Sighs'.  If it's good enough for Trower, it's certainly good enough for me!","summary":"Sound Like Robin Trower on Bridge Of Sighs!","unixReviewTime":1484611200,"vote":null,"style":{"style:":" Pedal only"},"image":null}

But seriously, if you're a player who prefers pedals, you could easily spend thousands on boutique models (I've done it) and still not do that much better than the reasonably priced and unbelievably tough Boss pedals. I've talked to tone purists who say that these steal tone, muddy up the signal, etc... Eh, maybe there's some validity to this argument. But unless you're looking for ultra-pure, uncolored tube tone heaven, you would do well to go with a Boss rig, in my opinion. Here are some basic reasons why:\n\n1) Price is right.\n2) The Level, Rate, Depth and Filter knobs really do a lot to shape the tone. You can do even more with the high and low cuts.\n3) Stereo outs make for a really nice chorusing effect between amps.\n4) The pedal design is very responsive to the foot when playing, jumping around, and stomping. Some of the plunger switches on other types of pedals can get stuck, break, or fail to engage\/disengage when you step on them. The Boss switching is much smoother in my experience.\n5) Tough. I jam with a guitar player who has used and abused his Boss DS-1 distortion pedal for over 15 years and it's still hanging in there. Meanwhile, I broke a $340 boutique chorus pedal plunger switch with a clumsy stomp one day. That simply would not happen with a Boss and that's why I replaced said boutique candy ass with this one (even though it was easy to fix the switch on the other one with some solder).\n\nLong story short, the Boss line is money well spent.","summary":"Boss is the BOSS","unixReviewTime":1256601600,"vote":13.0,"style":null,"image":null}

I got the 11-50 set (had only used 9s and 10s-46 in the past except for recently trying the Heavier Ernie Ball sets). I had always heard minimal differences in the strings I had used.

It sounded brighter. I liked it, but just a minimal difference as I had mentioned before... But the moment I switched to the dirty channel and kicked on my overdrive pedal, it sounded like there was a monster roaring in my amp! For whatever I played on the dirty channel, whether it was very light gain to play CCR, or the gain turned to 11 for BLS, the tone was unbelievable and a super great variety. Other strings keep the same basic response whatever your settings are changed to. If you are set to high bass, and low treble, they still have insane treblet, low bass and vice versa. But not these strings. These change response to match what your amp\/pedal is set to! Need high treble and low bass? They will give you that. Need 10 bass and 4 treble?

{"overall":5,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"10 25, 2016","reviewerID":"A3PI8VVFKUQ8FD","asin":"B0002CZUDS","reviewerName":"James T. Walczak","reviewText":"Before I begin, please know that I've been a musician for over 3 decades and along with playing, I've been doing my own setups, repairs, builds and refinishing for most of that time as well.  In other words, please be assured that I do in fact know a little something about guitars.\n\nGuitar strings are, much like guitars themselves, a very personal matter of choice...everyone has different tastes and preferences.  For myself and the music I play (classic rock, blues, oldies, etc), GHS Boomers are about the best strings out there for electrics.  In short, I've probably tried just about every brand of guitar string out there in the 30+ years I've been playing...Slinky's, SIT, D'addarios, Gibson, Fender, Elixers...you name it, I've probably had them on a guitar at one point or another. The simple truth is that sooner or later, I have always come back to GHS Boomers for my electrics (I like Earthwoods on my acoustics and Rotosounds on my basses).\n\nTo me, there are 3 major factors to consider when choosing\/purchasing guitar strings; tone, feel and longevity.  You can have a great sounding guitar string, but if it tarnishes and rusts out inside of a week (much like D'addario's do), then they're really just a waste of money.  Likewise, you can have strings that hold out for ages, but if they sound like crap (like Elixers and SIT's...terrible strings), again, what's the point?  And obviously, no one wants to use guitar strings that feel like barbed wire!  LOL!  So that said, as a person who currently owns over 20 guitars (at one time my collection was over 40), I go through -A LOT- of guitar strings...I KNOW guitar strings...and I've found Boomers to have the best over-all combination of those three factors - tone, feel and longevity.  The fact that their affordable, in my book at least, is just icing on the cake!\n\nTo give you a quick comparison, I would compare the tone and feel of these strings to the ever infamous Ernie Ball Slinky's (which I use as my backups when I can't get ahold of Boomers)...to my ears the sound is a bit brighter, but not by much and the feel is VERY comparable.  If you've used and like Slinky's, I suspect you'll be pleased with these as well.  The biggest difference is in the longevity...all things being equal and assuming I'm cleaning my strings and such after playing, I might get a month out of Slinky's before they really need to be changed (when I'm playing regularly), where as I can often go 2 - 3 months between string changes with the Boomers.  No, they don't maintain that \"new string sound\" for THAT long and for recording situations I'd go with new strings in any case, however for average playing...practices, gigs, etc., they do in fact hold up quite well.\n\nIn addition, I also have to say that I especially like these \"Thick & Thins\", 10-52 gauge (I think the Slinky equivalent is \"Heavy Bottoms\").  I play mostly Strats (again as far as my electrics go) and I find these give my Strats a bit fuller sound than standard 10's.  They're also fairly close to the same gauge I use on my acoustics so there's not too much of a shock when I switch back and forth.\nBTW...since we're talkin' guitar strings here, a quick piece of wisdom - for those who may be moving to a heavier gauge (say from .009's to .010's), MAKE SURE you have your instrument setup by a qualified tech!  In my many years of playing, I've seen more guitars screwed up because people didn't understand the importance of a good setup.  Changing string gauges on your instrument typically requires the nut be filed for the correct string width, along with truss rod and bridge adjustments, etc.  It's well worth learning to do yourself, however if you've never done this sort of thing before (i.e. you're new to guitars in general which is why you're reading this review to begin with, LOL), it's well worth finding a decent tech.\n\nSo with all of that, I have to give these a big ol' 5 out of 5 stars.  I've used Boomers for a good many years now...they are part of \"my sound\" and they have always come thru for me!  Ya really can't ask for much more than that.","summary":"much like guitars themselves","unixReviewTime":1477353600,"vote":null,"style":{"Size:":" Single Set","Style:":" Thin & Thick"},"image":null}

It is no wonder why so many world class musicians have used Boomers over the years.  Great tone for the price and, like so many other reviewers commented on, the durability of these is great.  I rarely ever break a Boomer and I tend to leave them on my guitar way too long but they still don't break.  I will occasionally try other stings and find some that I like and a lot that I don't but I always know that I can count on GHS Boomer to deliver so that has sort of become my baseline string over the years and the one I measure the others against if that makes sense.  Definitely worth spending a few bucks and trying if you have never played them before....if you have played them before you probably aren't reading this review and instead are most likely just hitting 1-click checkout.","summary":"These are really the industry standard when it comes to affordable high-quality guitar strings","unixReviewTime":1453939200,"vote":null,"style":{"Size:":" Single Set","Style:":" Light"},"image":null}

What I mean by that is this stick has a pronounced and relatively long taper. If you play Moeller technique that taper aids in achieving the whipping motion that is the key to the technique. As importantly - to me - is the finish that allows me to lightly hold the stick without worrying about it flying out of my hands when they get sweaty.\n\nFinally, these sticks come from the factory straight, and the pairs seem to be well matched from a weight and balance perspective. I have never had a new pair fail the roll test (roll the sticks on a flat surface to see if they wobble indicating warp or not 100% straight.)\n\nOne final note: stick choices are personal, so while this stick is one of my favorites, it may be too light or slender for your personal tastes.

I mention it in the review but well over a year later I'm thrilled with it, and it's about 35 bucks more. Well worth the investment for more reasons than I have time to get into right now. This Crybaby will do if you absolutely can't stretch your budget. *\n\nHard item to review because there's a lot of ways to look at this thing. In short, it's a good and obviously usable wah with a classic sound, and at a great price. BUT, it's a one-trick pony and has a few small drawbacks. There are (very slightly) better sounding and more functional wahs today in my opinion, though none at this price.\n\nFirst some wah history + my experience: wahs went into major production in the mid-60s, and so this design is a reflection of the infancy of wahs. To some, especially in the guitar community, the earliest designs of [whatever] were the best and there's no changing their mind. My Dad's a guy like that. Fair enough, I know I'm not swaying opinions that were formed 40+ years ago! But I got my Crybaby (from Dad) as a present in '88 or '89 and used it for 20+ years. Never even tried another, before recently. I had just always been accustomed to all of the little quirks of my Crybaby and accepted them.\n\nI don't use the wah effect all that much and it stays off for probably 3 out of 4 songs; it's a pretty essential effect when needed but easy to get carried away with. Most of the music I play falls somewhere in the range of heavy rock-heavy metal, but at home I'll do a little classic rock or blues rock here and there. I'm not doing anything radically different with a wah, mostly just your typical Guns N' Roses, Alice in Chains, Jimi Hendrix type parts and the occasional solo. I don't want a wah pedal to sound radically different.\n\nAnyway so that's where I'm coming from. Now on my Crybaby, one day the pot crapped out again and I just decided it was time to explore other options, figuring I could always repair it or replace it with the same if I wanted. I've been through lots of guitars and amps, and many other pedals, but was generally okay with the Crybaby for my purposes. Not perfectly happy but content. So breaking down some specifics here:\n\nThe good:\n\n-Solid, heavy construction (bottom plate aside, that's a little thin, but there are large rubber feet so it doesn't matter)\n-Mechanical\n-Familiar, classic sound, can't go wrong\n-No learning curve\n-Relatively low price\n-You have the ability to turn it on and leave it cocked in a certain position for a certain sound. I don't like the \"cocked wah\" sound personally, but some people do it on occasion. Many wahs do this but many like Morleys don't, those rest in the fully back position\n\nThe so-so or bad:\n\n-It activates by pushing all the way forward in the treble position and making a hard click, which can be audible to the audience. There are better designed wahs, where it turns on and off just by putting your foot on or off the pedal.\n-Requires somewhat uncommon adapter so doesn't work with most daisy-chain power cables people are using today\n-The original potentiometer was sketchy for me, but that happens with time\n-A little hard to clean. Not normally a consideration but dust can be problematic given design\n-The bottom plate is a little thin, odd compared to solid feel of the rest of pedal. Doesn't really matter but worth noting.\n-There's zero adjustability\n-Not true bypass. I think too much tends to be made about true bypass these days and there are worse offenders.\n-No alternate features at all, it doesn't double as a volume pedal, you can't change the sweep range or anything like that.\n-I had occasional issues with interference including even random radio signals!\n\n-To me personally, the sweep range is too wide, as in too bassy on one end, and waaay too trebly and harsh when full forward. The \"sweet spot\" you really want is smaller than I'd like. And again, you can't adjust anything. Now some people like this sweep range as is, and once you get used to the pedal you'll get a feel for where your preferred range is and your foot will \"learn\" where to go.\n-In practice, I found a little compression helps to balance out the pedal. It feels somewhat louder when in the treble position versus the bass positions, making some notes a little more lost in the mix while others cut right through. Some other wahs seem a little smoother in this regard. And again, this is something other people may like.\n\nI think $70 is a great price for this and reflects its current place among wahs, minor flaws and nonexistent feature set. Solid choice for beginners and intermediate players on a budget, and served me well enough for years. It's the classic wah sound and once you find that sweet spot and get the feel for it, it sounds good. However I think other wahs not only sound better but offer more, albeit at a greater cost.\n\nAlternatives: I tried 10-12 total between a few NJ shops so really only a handful in the grand scheme. But I was especially impressed with the Cantrell wah, the Tremonti Wah, Weeping Demon, and Fulltone Clyde Deluxe. I eventually wound up with the Morley Vai 2 wah which isn't a very classic design, but sounds the best. Plus it had some adjustability to fine tune it to my own preferences. For me it's just the great wah sound but with a more modern and functional design...I was able to adjust it, no more CLICK to activate, and you can even adjust activation time from instant to more than 3 seconds (though instant-on is the only way to go for me).\n\nBut to be clear this Crybaby is still a good pedal if you're just looking for a wah, and probably the perfect choice if you're gift shopping for someone's first. It's still at least 90% as good as anything else as far as sound and I wouldn't suggest an upgrade to someone with a (working) Crybaby already - unless they're very particular. If this were the only wah in the world I wouldn't have a problem using it forever. Nobody in the audience would hear a real difference between this and most any other wah effect anyway.\n\nStill...if you're a somewhat serious or working guitarist and need a wah I'd explore some of the newer options for sure, even if they're other Crybabys. You can't go wrong with this one but you can do better.","summary":"Mixed feelings.

Well, that goes for strings as well. The\none relatively inexpensive thing you can do for yourself is to try different sizes and types of\nstrings.\n\nListen, who cares what Jimi or Jimmy used. Seek out and develop your own tone. Strings can\nhelp you do that. When it comes to the vintage sound there is pure nickel. Companies, in the\n50s, experimented with different metals but pure nickel was found to be the most pleasing,\nbalanced tone, and easy on the frets too. In those early years electric players wanted less\ndistortion also. Pure nickel produced less distortion as well.\n\nWell, things shifted from Nickel to steel strings. Two ideas were that either economics was the\nreason nickel was no longer wanted or the tonal shifts of the 1960s. A compromise was brought\nabout and nickel plated steel strings were born.\n\nThese GHS Boomers are most likely going to give you some warmth from the nickel plating along\nwith a clean tone. If that is what you want. They can also be hotter dependent upon their blend\nof nickel to steel. These Boomers don't bend as easily as pure nickel but that is what you would\nexpect with a steel center. Also, nickel plated steel strings appear to not sustain as well as pure\nnickel.\n\nI have tried both pure nickel and nickel plated. Indeed the pure nickel (all things being equal) are\nmore mellow, easier to bend and tend to give you a \"vintage\" tone. The Boomers tend to provide\nmore of an edge. They will sound hotter and brighter on your electric. That can be fun, so much\nfun, especially with a nice pair of P-90s on your guitar.\n\nIf you use, or plan on using, a lot of tone-sucking effects pedals, going with the brighter, hotter,\nstring like these GHS Boomers would be a good choice. Again, if that is what you are looking for in\na sound. Search any guitar forum and up will rise from the thread-graveyard a ton of threads on\nstrings and how they can affect tone. Or not. Lots of opinionated musicians on guitar forums. This\nis why some people buy multiple guitars. A guitar for every season, so to speak, with nickel plated\nsteel on one and pure nickel on another.\n\nI have used these strings on a solid body Gibson Les Paul guitar and on a semi-hollowbody Fender\nTelecaster guitar. Slightly different sounds. Again, think about the wood, or lack of it, on the guitar.\nThat is where some of the resonance comes from, along with the type of pickup, height of those\npickups and, of course, your playing style. Most serious musicians know that Jimi's, Jimmy's, and\neven Eddie or Slashes tone is in their fingers.\n\nI like these strings and give them 5 stars because they are well made, sound good. I also like the\nin between gauge. They don't bend as well as pure nickel of the same gauge, but I knew that going\nin, so no stars off for that. GHS is a good company and stand by their product. The Boomers come\nin 8s (Ultra Light) all the way to 13s (Heavy). So take your pick, try some of these strings and\nmake some hot music tonight.","summary":"Hot and Bright:  GHS Boomers Electric Guitar Nickel Plated Steel Strings [9-1\/2 - 44]","unixReviewTime":1385337600,"vote":12.0,"style":{"Size:":" Single Set","Style:":" Extra Light+"},"image":null}

The trick is to find a pair in weights that match your application.\n\nBasic characteristics are heavy with a defined chick, but not nearly as defined as the Mastersound series, and excellent ride qualities, especially when used with a loose clutch and partially open.  Most of these pairs are too heavy for lighter jazz, but there are exceptions if you have an idea of the weight. They are typically in the 1200 top and 1550 bottom range (in grams). Those weights work for most loud, heavily amplified music.\n\nIf you sift through a number of pairs, though, you will find music lighter ones. That is because there is a lot of variation in Zildjian's manufacturing process. If you  are playing lightly amplified music, like some forms of progressive rock and more traditional blues, then an 1100 gram top and a bottom in the 1450 range will work well. Of course, even lighter is better. For louder jazz with horns and some amplification 1050 gram tops and 1375-1400 gram bottoms should work. For acoustic music I would look at the K Custom or K Constantinople lines for appropriate hats.\n\nMy advice usually means purchasing them in a brick and mortar store or from an online source that can provide the weights of a specific pair. Only boutique sellers offer this service.  However, if you are playing loud(er) music then an off-the-shelf pair is probably sufficient. These are, after all, one of the standards among drummers and have been ever since Louis Bellson collaborated with Zildjain in the early 60s to develop this model.","summary":"Probably the most versatile hats for rock","unixReviewTime":1374710400,"vote":4.0,"style":{"Size:":" 14\""},"image":null}

Amazon got me taken care of almost immediately, so I'm really happy about that.\n\nIn any event, the guitar is a GREAT value for the money. It has great tone and sustain, the neck is fast and wide making it easier to play, especially if you have big hands. I had a Squier Strat Standard at one time and it does not even come close to this guitar (or the Epiphone SG-310 I had prior to the LP-100) in quality OR sound. There's just NO comparison.\n\nSpeaking of the SG-310, I actually think it sounds a bit better than the LP-100, however, both are very versatile and can play just about any music. Quality and construction are excellent. This is NOT a \"beginner\" guitar. You can perform live with it and I think it will hold up fine for YEARS!\n\nI miss my SG and will most likely pickup another one very soon, but I don't regret getting another LP (I had one for over 20 years). This truly is an excellent guitar for such a little price.\n\nI've been playing since about '72 and it's easily (along with the SG) one of the best guitars I've owned. You really do get Gibson sound without the Gibson price tag. There are higher-level LP's (and SG's) with the neck thru bodies (the LP-100 and SG-310 have bolt on necks) and I may \"move up\" someday, but I have no complaints at all with this guitar. Didn't have any with the SG either. Oh, yeah, higher-end models use different\/better wood. Just don't think this guitar is the \"cheap stuff\"...you would be very wrong if you did.\n\nI give it 4 stars because I think the SG-310 beats it in the sound\/sustain department...but JUST barely. There's a reason the LP has been a music staple for DECADES and this model carries on that tradition.\n\nAll in all, the LP-100 was a VERY wise choice for me.","summary":"Happy at last!","unixReviewTime":1275696000,"vote":65.0,"style":null,"image":null}

These strings offer a nice compromise.  I have two '76 Les Paul deluxe guitars, and I've vacillated between using 9's and 10's on them for years.

Jones","reviewText":"I bought these on a whim -I wanted to try GHS strings- and noticed afterwards that they were .0095, .0115, .016, .024, .032, .044. so I put them up since I just had my Squier Fat Strat set up for 9's.\n\nFast forward a while and it is time to change strings again.\nThe only pack I find on-hand are these 9.5s.  I figured \"what the heck, I'll use them ... I might need to tweak the truss rod or saddles a bit, but I've wanted to learn more about doing that anyway.\"  I have a couple of Dan Erlewine's books so I was ready to go.\n\nWell, I might \"need\" to tweak the setup or intonation, but I cannot feel or hear it.\n\nThe strings are close enough to the 9's that they play fine for me - a relative beginner who can barely play Wild Thing or Brown Eyed Girl.\nThese 9.5s seem to be more stable and stay in tune better than the 9's and they are clearly louder; I practice unplugged.  The tone is so much more obvious that I re-checked my tuning - twice.  They are more resonant and have more sustain than the 9's.  My meager bends are no more difficult than with the 9's but the guitar sounds better.\nAll this without doing a new set-up or tweaking anything.  I'm impressed.\n\nWhat more could I ask for?  Hmmmm...\nWell, they are not less than $3 a set like Webstrings (not bad, but I do not care for how they are packaged), Darco (a lot like D'Addario who used to make them - great value) or Xaviere (too stiff feeling, IMO), but sometimes you do get what you pay for.  Also, I suspect 9.5 sets might be hard to find in your local music stores.\n\nBTW, this may be a \"unique\" gauge as stated above, but other vendors are doing the same thing.  I can say with certainty that at least D'Addario (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/D-Addario-EXL120-Electric-Guitar-Strings-Super-Light-Plus-9-5-44\/dp\/B0002H03YY\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">D'Addario EXL120+ Electric Guitar Strings, Super Light Plus, 9.5-44<\/a>) and DR (Half-Tite HT-9.5) also have string sets with comparable thicknesses.\nIn fact AFAICT, the gauges are identical to a D'Addario EXL120+ set.\n\n-------------------- Treble e -  B  -  G -  D  -  A -  Bass E\nGHS Boomers GB9.5:  0095  - 0115  - 016 - 024w - 034w - 044w\nDR Half-Tite HT-9.5: ___  9.5 -- 12 -- 16 -- 24 -- 34 -- 44\nD'Addario EXL120+:  .0095 -- .0115 -- .016 -- .024 -- .034 -- .044\n\n* Do not mistake the very common D'Add EXL120s (9s) for the EXL120+ (9.5s) sets\n\nIf you play 9's and are curious if the \"tone\" from 10's are worth the \"bending\" effort, or maybe if you play 10's but your fingers aren't as young as they once were then I encourage you to give 9.5's a try.  At $4 or $5 a set, it probably is about what you are paying now, and you have a few well-known string companies to choose from.\nI think I will be experimenting with the 9.5 sets more in the future.","summary":"Impressed - 9.5's seem like an easy gauge to play with a great sound","unixReviewTime":1298246400,"vote":null,"style":{"Size:":" Single Set","Style:":" Extra Light+"},"image":null}

If you are like me though and place it in a pedal board where a unified power source makes sense and must use a different power cable, at least on my unit, the jack is not fitting properly leading to some serious shorts. Those shorts can make a crowd deaf in no time flat. What I have learned is that when using a different power supply to be sure the power jack is push ALL THE WAY in, otherwaise, ZAP.

This wah pedal just doesn't cut it.  Maybe at one time, but not today, it hasn't been up to par in a LONG time.  As a young player I insisted on having a wah pedal.  My mom bought me this one.  I thought it was awesome until I learned better.  It took me about a week to learn how to turn it on and when I finally did I thought I broke it!\n\nThe eq on this pedal isn't good, there is no smooth transition from heel to toe.  There is a big drop in the freq. that kills the effect.  You have to pump your foot really fast to avoid having that drop.  You have to pretty much push it toe foward and then literally stomp on it to turn it on and then follow the same steps to turn it off.  Very inconvenient for someone who is trying to rapidly move between effects on a board.  I can't say its just a complete piece of junk, it does give you a wah effect, it is a classic pedal but THERE IS BETTER out now so why are we still stuck in the stone age with this thing?  I even had someone mod mine and while it gave it a little more headroom and fixed the dropping issue, I still had to slam on it to turn it on\/off and it still sounded like a cheap wah.\n\nMy suggestion?  The Mark Tremonti wah is great!  Kicks this things end when it comes to range and simplicity to use!  It may cost more, but you will probably end up hating the crybaby and getting one anyway, so just go with the Tremonti Power Wah to begin with.  What I use for wah is the Digitech RP250 processor.  You may say that this is a cheap processor, and it is, but I've been using it for years and I haven't seen anyone that can tell the price of it based on the sound quality and thats what matters.  Why I suggest it for wah is you can control the sensitivity, how hard you have to press your toe down to turn it on (I have mine set fairly light) and you can totally shape your tone right there on the board very easily.  You even have presets (crybaby being one of them)  You can get an entire processor full of effects AND an awesome wah for a little bit more.\n\nIf you want a cheap child's gimic-type toy, this is for you.  Want to get serious about a wah?

I haven't had an electric in years, and didn't have the budget to get a Gibson, so picked up this Epi Les Paul 100 instead, along with a Fender Mustang I Amp.  Great combination.  This guitar has a very sloid feel, and came set-up perfectly right out of the box.  All it needed was tuning.  Unlike others, I didn't feel that the strings I got needed to be changed right away, but probably within the first two weeks you will want to change them.  Replaced mine with Ernie Ball \"Not Even Slinky's\" and couldn't be happier with the way this thing plays and sounds.  Great sustain, beautiful harmonics, the clean tones are warm, can get nice blues tones out of it, and superb thrash metal too.  Very versatile.  It does not quiet do country or jazz, but it wasn't really meant to.\n\nThe action is extremely easy, fret board has a great feel to it, good width on the neck, not too slinder but not too thick.  It just feels good in your hands.\n\nThe finish on this product is very nice.  One thing though, the pick guard is kind of a tan \/ cream off white color, not bright white as pictured, but it still looks great.\n\nAlso, not mentioned in the description, but this does come with a 12 foot cord, but it's not the best quality.  Would recommend picking up a new one when you order.\n\nOverall, this is well worth the $500 that they list as the MSRP.

He had a deep emotional attatchment to it because of the person who gave it to him, and we couldn't really ask him to get rid of it. We once spent 3 hours in a studio attempting to tune and adjust this guitar. He ended up using my guitar for the rest of the session.

With the Original CryBaby, Dunlop has somehow managed (using testimonials from the pros) to sucker countless people, myself included, into thinking this is the Wah to get.\n\nProblems include the following:\n\nAlmost no low-end wah. Playing from a large, loud Marshall stack, if I play anything on the E6 or A5 strings and try to augment with wah you can't hardly hear any change. Granted I use very heavy distortion, but with high-end Seymour humbuckers and a Marshall stack, the sound is clean and distinguishable when not using the wah, and nearly the same when using it. For low-end I have noticed an interesting effect that IS possible though; activating the wah and then dropping it back to almost the back of the pedal and leaving it like that can make an interesting sound that would be comparable in comparison to talking normally and talking with your mouth nearly completely covered.\n\nThe other problem, which is actually present in MOST wahs (except one I'll mention in a second) is button activation. First of all, having to push the pedal UP to click it on makes it so you can't effectively start with a closed wah sound, only full open wah. Second, having to adjust the pedal just to get it to the point where it is activated uses precious milliseconds of deliberate action that could be spent focusing on that new lick you haven't perfected, or nailing every note in that solo you're performing.\n\nWhen I want wah I want it now. And when I want it I want to open into wah, not have it already open when the button is pressed. And when I'm done with wah I want it off. These problems have been solved by Morley with the Bad Horsie and Bad Horsie 2 Vai Wahs. They have no button so all you do is start pushing the pedal and it auto starts the wah-wah effect. When you are done with the wah, step off the pedal and it will deactivate in less than a second and go back to normal. Also, it's on a spring which may not be ideal for some, but it will reset the pedal to the down (back) position when your foot comes off. The good thing with this is you only have to push with your toes, essentially just stepping on it, and then lightening you step to bring it back instead of adjusting pressure to the heal and pushing it back down.\n\nAll that being said, it does work and it does create a wah-wah effect (though only effective through a clean amp or in lead sequences) so you do get what was advertised and at a decent price (the Bad Horsie is around 3 times as much).\n\nAdditional Info: Mine was purchased through Amazon from Dunlop and yet still did not come with a power adapter. Battery life is very, very short. And leaving a cable plugged into the \"Input\" (from the guitar) WILL run the battery down, even if the cable isn't plugged into anything on the other end. It makes no sense and can cost money.","summary":"Functional yet disappointing","unixReviewTime":1286582400,"vote":5.0,"style":{"style:":" Pedal only"},"image":null}

Yes, they are made a lot better today than when Paul bought his first one for about $175.00 in 1961. But most folks can't afford that. A cost effective alternative in the same style has always been the Epiphone Viola bass.\n\nFor about a quarter of the cost of a new Hofner 500-1, you can have the look and  sound close to that of the original, with some differences and caveats. The Hofner is a hollow body bass, which means that there is an open space inside the body of the guitar. This is one of the main contributors to it's original sound, which is more subdued, and mellow than more modern solid body basses, which have no chamber.\n\nThe Viola is also of the hollow body design. Though the electronics on the Viola are radically different from a Hofner, with the two humbucking pickups, a set of tape wrapped Hofner style strings, and amp modeling, you are right there back in Liverpool's Cavern Club.\n\nI bought my Viola several years ago and am delighted with it's vintage styling and classic British Invasion sound. For those who are interested in it's stats:\n\n* Top: Laminated flame maple\n* Neck: Maple, set\n* Chrome hardware\n* 30.5\" short scale\n* 2 pickups: NYR & NYT mini humbuckers\n* Nut width: 1.65\"\n* Fingerboard: Rosewood\n* Inlay: Dots\n* Finish: Vintage sunburst\n\nMy Viola bass was manufactured in Korea and is flawless in construction, fit and finish. In 2003, Epiphone, opened a factory in China to keep up with world demand.\n\nRecently, Hofner has released two new lines of their Hofner Beatle bass. The Hofner Icon bass is a close approximation of the original, even though many have compared it more to the Viola bass. It sells for around $400.00.\n\nThe Hofner Contemporary bass is a close ( though not exact) replica of their main line of Beatle bass. It is a beautiful bass guitar and sells for around $800.00.\n\nThat still may be a little high for those who want the look and sound but can't afford a Hofner. I can highly recommend the Epiphone Viola Bass as a good sounding and easy playing alternative to the original!","summary":"Best Of Both Worlds - A Beatle Bass That Plays & Sounds Great!","unixReviewTime":1228435200,"vote":40.0,"style":null,"image":null}

I loved it. It's a switchless pedal that I put through hell. I had it for 3 months before I had to send it back cause it broke. It's still an ok pedal but I wanted the ability to leave the pedal \"open\" to achieve a certain warm sound. That's when I went looking at the cry baby.\nAt the local retailer they had several different kinds of cry babies set up. I put this one against the Hendrix, Classic, and 95-Q cry baby pedals and this basic one sounded by far the best. The only one that sounded better was the 535Q but at over $200 it was out of my price range. I paid $97+tax for my GCB-95 cry baby and it was worth every penny. I don't even touch my Morley anymore.

The Morley pedals have a separate on\/off switch, so you can turn them on or off at a given position.  The difference is the sound is just a bit more professional if the wah isn't always turning on or off at the top of the wah frequency.  Suppose you wanted to set the wah in the middle, and just leave it there.  You can't really do that with this pedal.  It is a bit smaller than a morley wah, but in my experience, the sound is equivalent on the base models.","summary":"Step to turn on\/off","unixReviewTime":1209686400,"vote":23.0,"style":{"style:":" Pedal only"},"image":null}

I've bought and sold literally dozens of pedals, many of them some kind of distortion, fuzz, OD, etc.  Its a hobby, addiction, whatever you wanna call it, I've owned way too many of these things.\n\nOne of my least favorite pedals was the Boss DS-1.  Sure, it was inexpensive and extremely durable, but it sounded lousy.  It was a noisy, brittle, fake sounding tone, and I didn't find a likeable sound no matter the settings or what guitar or amp I was running it through.  Long story short I had it modded into a particular Marshall overdrive circuit and its now fantastic as it sounds nothing like the stock models.\n\nSo imagine my surprise when I get a used DS-2 for a steal on ebay and its actually a good pedal!  This pedal does what the DS-1 was SUPPOSED to do but failed at:  Its a good, general purpose distortion.  Its not a super saturated sound, but its a likable tone that's far more full than the DS-1 ever got.  Also unlike the DS-1, it sounds great on every amp I've tried it on (one of which seems to hate boss pedals, so I was very impressed by that).\n\nIts not a metal distortion, but for classic rock crunch, this pedal does just fine.  I actually stacked it up against my script era MXR Distortion + and I was able to dial in a tone that sounded very similar, if just a touch less transparent.\n\nAll in all, a great, versatile little pedal that does exactly what its supposed to do.  If you're thinking of buying a DS-1, skip it, this thing is worth the little bit of extra cash, it is easily ten times the pedal.\n\nPOST SCRIPT EDIT (3-16-12):  I won ANOTHER DS-2 off ebay for a ridiculous steal again, this time one made in Japan.  GOOD NIGHT!  The Japanese ones are amazing!  Its like having a Marshall stack on the floor!  I mean these new ones are good pedals (esp compared to the new DS-1s) but the Japanese ones are flat out amazing.  I can only assume the Japanese DS-1s are similarly impressive, and if so, I can finally understand how that pedal ever got the reputation it for some reason still carries.  Grab a Japanese one if you can (and prepare to have your face melted!), if not, the new ones are still a fine pedal.","summary":"I'm surprised at how much I like this pedal...","unixReviewTime":1306195200,"vote":22.0,"style":null,"image":null}

A boom arm will have to be able to support a decent amount of weight to add this on top of the weight of your mic.","summary":"Good but heavy","unixReviewTime":1453075200,"vote":null,"style":{"Style:":" Pop Filter with Stablizing Arm"},"image":null}

It costs $70 more but those relatively minor things are what made me buy it, and I'm very glad I did. One other thing is that this board has eggshell foam on the inside of the lid to pad your pedals in transit where the the PB600 does not.\n\nSo I use this to play at church 2 times a week, practice and Sunday services. So the portability is very nice and it's easy to handle in all aspects of the process. It has 7 ports on the chain so I have 6 pedals and a tuner, the board fits everything nicely. I did build my pedals around this board so do keep that in mind.\n\nOverall I really do like it for what it is and my current stage of gear it fits my needs perfectly, but there are things where I'm still left wanting, mainly the size, and I realize that this board isn't the end all be all board, but it's great for what it is. At some point I'll have to rebuild a board on something bigger and more fitting a larger set up, but until then..","summary":"Many pro's few con's.","unixReviewTime":1464998400,"vote":4.0,"style":null,"image":null}

It has been on nearly every gig with me and while the plastic is worn, the power cord replaced and missing one of the locks, it still provides protection for pedals. I do wish the case was better fit for a wah or volume pedal but, the hardened plastic has taken the abuse of the weekend warrior rock star for many years. Like any ABS plastic, the outside is quite hard but will scuff, so if your one of these people that buy road gear cases that you want to keep pristine, this isn't for you. If your like me and need something that will keep the real expensive and sometimes un-replaceable pedals inside secure when it falls out of the back of your truck, gets stepped on while on stage, thrown around by band mates in the trailer, then this is the case for you. Comes with some very nice cables for connecting your gear. The cables are so nice, I tried to find them on Boss' website to order some for my other gear! (Couldn't find them) Also I think the new models come with a small power brick and power cord, my original had a short wall wart. In the end I purchased some 'One Spots' to use on the board anyway, so use what you like, just be sure its rated to handle your pedals. Would have been nice to have another voltage available but, this is not a 50 pedal board, truly made for the one-off weekend warrior.

I've played Thunderbirds at Guitar Centers before and I've always loved their look and sound, so I decided to buy one for myself. Overall, I love it but it has some drawbacks.\n\nPros: -It's a beautiful looking instrument. The vintage sunburst on the body looks great and so does the distinctive Thunderbird logo. The 'reverse' body gives it a radical, eye-catching look.\n\n-It has a great, deep, rumbling tone. The bottom end is nice and clean and the higher end sounds pretty great too. Out of all the basses I own, I love the sound of this one the most. Its a great sound for rock or metal.\n\nCons: -Thunderbirds are notorious for their weight and tendency for neck-dive, and this one is no different. It's fairly weighty, although not as heavy as some other basses I own like my Schecter Stilletto 5. If you're used to playing basses on the heavier end it shouldn't be an issue. The neck will sometimes dive if you take your hands off the instrument with the neck at a low angle, but if you keep the neck at a high angle before you let go, it usually won't dive on its own. If you play it sitting down, it feels pretty comfortable, but for some reason something about the design of the body always makes my right leg fall asleep.\n\n-THE WORST ISSUE: perhaps in response to complains about neck dive in earlier Thunderbird models, Epiphone have moved the location of one of the strap attachment points. Instead of being positioned on the side of the body above the neck (as it is in most guitars\/basses and as it is in the picture) it is now located on the back of the instrument where the neck bolts on to the body.\n\nWhile this has largely corrected the neck dive issue, the problem is that for whatever reason Epiphone decided to make one of the neck bolts extra long and make the strap attachment nub a part of this bolt. After playing it a few hours a day for about 3 or 4 days, this neck bolt ripped right out of the body (fortunately I caught the Thunderbird before it hit the floor). The weight of the bass had caused the bolt to strip it's threads inside the body and slip right out, taking the strap with it.\n\nBesides this glaring issue, I love this bass and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a deep, growling tone for rock or metal.\n\nEDIT: I called Epiphone and they had me send in the bass to be repaired. They moved the strap button to where it is on the picture (above the neck) and repaired the stripped bolt. And...now the neck dives like no tomorrow. Seriously, if you play this bass standing up you can't take your fretting hand off of the neck at all or else it will dive straight for the floor. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.\n\nThat said, I've had this bass for eight months now and I'm still madly in love with it. It can handle anything I throw at it and it looks as beautiful and eye-catching as ever.","summary":"A great bass with a few issues","unixReviewTime":1389657600,"vote":11.0,"style":{"Color:":" Electric Bass Guitar"},"image":null}

All the Jazz, precision and P\/J bass' I've played just haven't filled that void.  I play mostly classic rock and blues covers which is where this bass excels.  It has amazing tone and growl to die for.  I bought mine used and it was set up and ready to go by the time it got to me (just needed a new set of strings).  With a set of DiAddario semi flats and a KB200 amp I got a tone I'm not going to try to replace for a long time.  It wasn't a purchase I rushed into I tried other Epiphones (EB series [what can say I say, I'm attracted to the Humbucker]), Squire's, Ibanez (gsr, sr), ESP, and even a Danelectro.  None, NONE of those came close to the tone I got from the Thunderbird (of course I may be bias as it does play into the genre I prefer).  Any Bass that had a better sound was easily twice the price ($600+).  The body is killer, and as far as I can tell indestructible (You can search reviews online and find testimony to this).  Watch out for the neck dive though, I didn't think it would bother me at first, but after holding through practice for a couple hours it gets tiring. The neck is pretty chunky, it's not what I would call \"fast\". 4 stars is appropriate for this bass, It's good but needs a few modifications to be great.","summary":"great instrument","unixReviewTime":1364169600,"vote":2.0,"style":{"Color:":" Electric Bass Guitar"},"image":null}

It came with a hardshell case and all for $249, which was a great price for what I got.\n\nAnd what I got was a great bass, which had a good tonal range but always sounded warm and never... piercing.  Sometimes, when a person is looking for a punchy bass sound they end up sounding piercing.  I never had any fret buzz or problems with the hardware.  This guitar looks very close to its Gibson counterpart, though they differ, mainly in the fact that the Epiphone has a bolt-on neck.\n\nDespite having the widely considered inferior bolt-on, this bass has some great sustain.  In fact, my only complaints about the insturment were that it was awkward to play while sitting down.  It wasn't THAT bad, for those of you who've played a \"V\" sitting down, but it did take getting used to.  My only \"real\" complaint then is, as another reviewer stated, the guitar is head-heavy and will tip down a bit if you let go of the neck momentarily.  Once my neck swung down and smaked the floor!

I was put on to the DOT by a friend who works at a chain music store, but I bought it through Amazon.\n\nIt came quickly and well packages, and in great shape out of the box.  I didn't adjust the setup, I just tuned the factory strings and started playing.  It feels like a high quality instrument from head to tail, so much so that I doubt the anti-China bias that you find when discussing guitars.  I've had it for just over a month, and I've played it pretty much every day.  I put some flat wounds on it and it hums.

Mine was shipped in a cheap cardboard box within box but somehow managed to survive the ordeal of shipping without incurring any damage (in spite of a big hole on the outer carton).  The Amazon product picture does not do the guitar any justice.  Amazon really should update it.  The guitar \"in person\" looks drop-dead gorgeous - with a glossy deep cherry finish that still allows you to see the wood grain through it.  The Amazon picture just looks flat in comparison.\n\nThe fit and finish on my guitar was absolutely flawless, as good as my multi-thousand dollar guitars!  The double cream binding on the body looks great.  The frets could probably do with a little bit of polishing\/reshaping or I may just simply play the guitar until they wear in a little bit.  This is common for guitars that come from the factory.  Speaking of the factory, mine is made in Indonesia and the guitar comes with a \"set up in the USA\" label and checklist that is hand-checked and signed.  One thing you must do when you get the guitar brand new is to tighten the truss rod as it will have been loosened for shipping.  Mine was completely loose when it arrived and there was a very slight bow in the neck as a result that was easily fixed by tightening the rod until it was no longer completely loose but not too tight either.  I also lowered the bridge slightly from the factory setting.\n\nWithout plugging it in, the guitar sounds lovely - that's why I love semi-acoustics!  The natural sustain is very, very impressive.  I'd say this guitar sustains better than my Fender Stratocaster.  The stock pickups sound very good to me.  My other guitars are all equipped with single-coil pickups so I love the contrast the Epiphone Dot's stock pickups give me.  You can eaily get a great sustaining blues or jazz sound.  It can even do some nice jangly sounds on the bridge pickup if I play with the EQ on my amp.  I'm sure if I upgraded the pickups to the Gibson '57 ones the guitar would sound even better, but frankly, I'm totally happy with it stock.\n\nOverall I'm really pleased that I got this.  It's the lowest cost guitar I own but it holds its own against the rest of my collection.  I've been wanting a ES-355 style guitar for some time now and I'm delighted with what I got.

I play professionally for most of my life at age 53  saw this guitar for this price and wondered how good can this copy be. My main guitar is a 78 Les Paul deluxe, top of the line Gibson gold plated the works. Had it since I was 18 and there is nothing like it in any way. I went to Gibson factory last year in Nashville and tried all Les Pauls below the deluxe level they were nice but not as smooth at any level untill you get the top of the line Les Paul. In fact I found the basic to mid range Gibsons no better quailty then this Epiphone. The difference really comes in the top level models.\n That all said this Epiphone is not the same at the Gibson 2,500.00 ES 335. What I did discover is that the fit and finish is very very good with a few minor blemishes\n( very minor you have to look close for)that Gibson would never pass. But I am comparing a Lincoln to a Ford here. They both will drive you in comfort, but the Lincoln( Gibson) does it perfectly on a smoother easier ride. But I have to say the Epiphone is a top of the line Ford for comparision sake. The neck is nice, smooth and not to bulky as I found on some of the Low priced Gibsons, sound is very nice, the finish is suprisingly nice for a 350 guitar. The defects are really minor to mention but I had to mention them because Gibsons are a perfect animal in the top price range. I would say this guitar could sell for twice the price. But due to LOW Chinese labor plus a well made Computer program cutting these crafted Guitars to be as close to perfect every time, time after time at a amazing price. The guitars are setup here in America.\n When I opened the box up its a very nice guitar no problems, stays in tune as well. I dropped the action down to a lower lever because thats how my Paul is and though I cant get it to feel like the Les Paul action, its a close second. I adjusted the intonaton . All tuned in perfectly and I am very very pleased as anyone will be. For me I got as close as a ES 335 for a tenth of the cost of owning one. So if your a pro player or just starting out as others have said you cant beat this price and the quailty, sound and feel. I ordered mine and it bounced from the west coast to my home in Pa and its just as nice as the one I played at a local store. I ordered in on line, no tax free shipping at a lower price then the local guitar store..... so I took the chance, turned out it was fine.\nOhh mine is a maple natural finish not Cherry but I saw all the finishes and they were as nice in all colors.\nChinese low labor costs and computer robots making as close to perfect guitars are what your getting. Things even low priced form Asia these days can be made well in these times we live in. This guitar is a great example. Computers replacing hand craftsman. Sad but this is where things have gone, maybe for the better, maybe not. I may look at Epiphone more seriously for now on.

For some reason, somebody between Vater and the UPS person who received the shipment (I'm looking at you, AMAZON) decided to un-pair the sticks from their Vater sleeves, then repackage them in a long, plastic sleeve with the Vater sleeve folded up next to the sticks in the baggie. I could tell when I opened the box that it wasn't going to be right, and as soon as I held them in my hands, I knew they were different weights. Visual inspection showed one stick obviously longer than the other, and if you look at the photo of the butt-end of the sticks along the ruler, you can see that the cuts are at different points of the curvature. There was a difference of 6 grams between the sticks. I've uploaded photos of the initial shipment.\n\nIn all fairness, this is the first time I've ever had this problem ordering sticks through Amazon. I've got 7 other pairs that were just fine before this - two of which were Vater sticks (Power 5B Sugar Maple Wood & Xtreme Design XD-5B Wood).\n\nAs far as Vater sticks when they aren't tampered with from the factory - great products. I've got the Power 5B Sugar Maple Wood Tip sticks already, and the size is great, I just need something a little sturdier when I'm on an acoustic set. These would have been perfect had they been a properly matched set.\n\nI'm giving this product one star based on a hair-brained decision to un-pair and repackage the sticks somewhere along Amazon's distribution line.","summary":"Somebody at Amazon needs to be educated about not un-pairing and repackaging drum sticks from the factory.","unixReviewTime":1417996800,"vote":2.0,"style":{"Size:":" Power 5B","Style:":" Wood Tip"},"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61EWwnMGFBL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61dfGjC7rsL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71zZmq2N1mL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61oTkFncU7L._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61iI2K2QjDL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71Rp1kVGE6L._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61kfF4XPseL._SY88.jpg"]}

One is that they weren't exactly generous with the length.  I could have used another couple of inches just to have a little more wiggle room while stringing up a concert.  And let's face it, the base material can't be expensive at all.  No need to be stingy with it.

Dunlop having the original and dual design locks.\n\nI have both types on my guitars.\n\nFirst the Dunlop: (all finish types)\nInstallation was simple, screw was replaced with the one included in the package. I had to drill one of my guitars to enlarge the hole, easy. The finish of the lock was O.K. the black suffered the most with some dings and scratches, depending on the shipping and how long the locks were packed the finishing flaws will vary. I noticed it the most on black.\n\nThey feel secure and lock well in place; I still feel they are a bit far from the guitar body as compared to the Schallers. I would recommend the dual design as opposed to the original.\n\nOne big negative is the strap installment; your life could turn into hell depending on the strap ends thickness. And the lock is just not designed to be removed form the strap easily. If you wish to change, wash or replace the strap in the future it is very hard and you could damage the locking mechanism (a metal ring, open locking C washer).\n\nSecond the Schaller: (chrome\/nickel)\nInstallation was simple also, straight on. Finish is great; however, metal washer for the strap ends could get damaged depending on what type of tool you use to install the locks on the strap. Use a flat small wrench available in hard ware stores (was not included in the package) I bought them from a local store.\n\nThey fell very secure and are snug to your guitar body resulting in less strain on the lock ends.\n\nInstalling the locks on the strap is a breeze, just tightening the nut with a washer over the strap and you're done. Changing the strap, no problems, easily loosen the nut and replace.\n\nThe only negative is that you could mar the teeth of you over tighten.\n\nBoth are great, however I recommend the Schaller.\n\nSorry for the long review.","summary":"Strap Locks Dunlop vs. Schaller","unixReviewTime":1227398400,"vote":183.0,"style":{"Color:":" Nickel"},"image":null}

When I say this Epiphone go up for $119., I decided to pull the plug - and boy, am I ever glad that I did.\n\nFirst off - it is beautiful. The finish is nicely applied and the fingerboard smooth, slim and easy to fret\/play. Although adjusting the string height is really easy on this instrument, I found no need to do so.

I opened it and could not find one flaw during the physical inspection.\nHere are some things that people typically worry about when considering a low-cost guitar:\nFretwork:  No sharp frets at all.\nPickups:  They are quite hot.  I adjusted the neck pickup down and the bridge pickup up to Gibson factory specs.  The neck was a muddy mess until I adjusted it.  Now they are both at the correct loudness and the mud cleared right up.  They don't sound bad at all.\nAction:  1\/16\" at the 12th fret from the factory all the way across (just the way I like it).  Zero buzzing.\nIntonation:  20 cents off high on the 4-6 strings.  1-3 strings dead on.  (I had to turn the 4th string saddle around \"backwards\" to get it to intonate properly.\nElectronics:  Different sound on each \"number\".  Very responsive potentiometers.  No static in the pickup selector switch.\nTuning Keys:  They are the low-end parallelogram-shaped one.  They are adequate, but slated for replacement.\nValue:  Unbeatable.  This is not just good guitar for the money, it's a good guitar period.\n\nFolks, I've purchased far more expensive instruments that required a lot more set up work than this guitar.  I really wasn't expecting much of a guitar for the price I paid.  I am highly impressed.  This guitar is easy to play and sounds amazing.  It's a very simple, plain guitar -- No bindings, no gold, no pickguard, no nonsense, all business.\n\nUPDATE:  I liked the Special-II so well I decided to get a Special-I with P-90's  too.  I think I like the Special-I pickups better, but the finish and tune-o-matic bridge on the Special-II are nice to have.\n\nUPDATE:  I just upgraded from 4 stars to 5 stars. I haven't touched my \"better\" guitars in over a week now.  I can't put this thing down.  It's just sounds so great and plays so easily.  I can't make it go out of tune.

First of all, I did research on new guitar options at the local Guitar Center website and settled on this instrument. They had it for $199, so for kicks I looked on Amazon two nights before I had planned to test and buy at our GC on a Sat. Amazon had it for $159 and $199 for lots of extras. I already had a case and nice Marshall Amp, so only needed the guitar. The best part, it arrived on Sat about the same time I would have purchased locally. The reviews were so good, I was not worried about testing live before purchase and it was a great choice.\n\nI'm only 3 months into this journey to become a musician, so a beginner, but absolutely love everything about this guitar. I messed around in the early 90's on old electric while in college, but never learned chords or any songs. When my wife acquired her old Sears-quality kids guitar from her Mom, I put new strings for something to mess around with on the weekends. Several weeks later, I got a cheap First Act electric for $25. Several weeks later a nice Takamine acoustic as the ears \"learned\" the notes and chords better. While switching from this quality acoustic guitar to the First Act, it was clearly apparent the First Act was a piece of junk. Notes and chords were just not clear and just not enjoyable to play. Well, this Epiphone is an awesome step forward combined with the Marshall amp. While I want to progress to blues scales in time, I've purposely focused on the major and minor chords and seamless transition between them. This guitar expresses the notes of chords so clearly. What I love most is the ability to slightly modify major chords like from Dmaj to Dsus4 and have it translate so clear as an example. Prior I never used the effects on my Marshall because it just sounded like a mess, but this guitar solves that issue. After a whole weekend of use, it felt like a big leap forward just because of quality. The fretboard layout helped refine the chords I've learned so far, so all strings were clear. Really helped practicing bending, hammer-ons and pull offs too. At any rate, for the money, it's hard to beat. I suspect that if this journey continues a more expensive guitar may be warranted in a few years, but as others have said, this will always be a quality practice instrument. Especially considering we spend every other weekend at our beach bungalow and it is nice not having to transport every time.\n\nOh, it was good to go right out of the box except a slight tightening of the strings to get in tune. No dings... in perfect condition.","summary":"I already had a case and nice Marshall Amp","unixReviewTime":1495497600,"vote":3.0,"style":null,"image":null}

(Update: the price has gone up and down since I purchased it for 159) And there are people actually complaining??? I don't care if it is an Epiphone and not a full blown Gibson, this sounds like a Les Paul Special, it certainly plays like one. The only thing is, I paid about a buck for it, not several hundred. It came setup just fine, with manual, an alin wrench for the kneck, which I checked, and needed no adjustment. There were only a couple of legitimate complaints about the guitar, the rest were people who ordered the package deal and had problems with the crappy amp. One: A user received his paint chipped, body blemishes, etc. Weird, obvious anomaly. Two: A user plugged into the amp with another guitar and it worked, so the problem lied with the electronics in the git.\nThis is a great take on the classic Les Paul is excellent for multiple applications, especially METAL, which isn't my main genre but I do play metal riffs occasionally, especially now on this guitar among my 12 other guitars.\nWhat a deal.\nWhen it comes to major guitar makers who make their own budget guitar, i.e. Fender Squier, etc. Epiphone is by far an exception. It is made by Gibson but there are Epiphone's for over a grand - it is by far different than \"budget guitars\" and has its own identity.

I love my Teles but I can't stand Fender strings. Likewise, I love my Martin ukulele, but trying these strings for the second time, I had the same conclusion as I did the first; Aquila's are far better. Aquila's have a more organic feel and a fuller, richer sound. The Martins begin to hold their tune sooner - Aquila's take a couple of days or more - but the sound is thinner and the feel isn't nearly as friendly. The approximately 3 dollar price difference is not, for me, worth the lesser satisfaction, even on my least expensive ukes. Considering how seldom one usually changes uke strings, the higher-priced Aquila's still seem to be worth the extra couple of bucks. Use the Martin's (or any cheaper string) when you are working on your uke, put the stress of repeatedly de-tuning and re-tuning on them. Then switch to Aquila's for playing.

{"overall":5,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"04 26, 2013","reviewerID":"AU90FZYTYG0FT","asin":"B0002CZVZK","reviewerName":"R. Ding","reviewText":"To summarize my review, which is kind of long: I love these martin strings on my 3 ukuleles. I cannot imagine putting any other strings on them. However, so far I have only tried Aquilas, these Martins, and whatever factory\/stock strings strung on my ukuleles.\n\nNow my novel of a review begins. It is a story filled with discovery, love, bad decisions, regret, hope, reunion, a happy ending, and opens up for the unknown future. I hope you read it all, because I kind of have gone from a total ukulele noob to kind of a more knowledgeable and experience player, and I hope that my review will give you some insight into your own preference of strings.\n\nMy first ukulele was a cheap Makala MK-P. It was $47 from Austin Bazaar fulfilled by Amazon. I knew that factory strings on this uke was terrible, and ordered a separate set of strings with it. From what I've researched online, people everywhere rave about the Aquila strings. However, being a cheapo, I got this Martin M600s because it is almost half the price of a set of Aquila. Since the order was over $25, the Martins qualified as an \"add-on\" item.\n\nI loved my Makala - it played perfect, and with the M600 strings it had a wonderfully sweet, bright, and clear sound, despite being all laminate.\n\nFast forward 1 months - I now own 3 more ukes: Kala ASLAS (Solid lacewood with solid spruce top), Kala GACT (golden acacia concert travel\/thinline), Pono MS (mahogany soprano). With two more on the way: Kala Solid Acacia Tenor, Islander Acacia Tenor. I bought all these from HMS - the Kalas all came with Aquila strings and HMS offers an extra set at discounted price that I usually get. So I have a bunch of Aquila strings.\n\nThe above paragraph basically leads to - now all my ukuleles are strung with Aquilas, as most every online sources I have researched praised Aquilas as \"the strings to have\", and you don't really see much said about these Martin strings. (Aquila and Worth seem to be what everyone talks about on UU and other sites). I have discarded my Martin strings, and got rid of my first ukulele, the Makala Pineapple, as I had better ukes, and thought I had better strings.\n\nHowever, I felt like my ukuleles weren't playing the sounds that I want or sound the way I thought they'd sound (except my Kala soprano with solid spruce top, that thing is bright as duck)I also felt that they weren't really good with finger picking or classical solos - the nylgut-esque material of the Aquila kind of sticks to your hands, or is easy to get caught in your fingernails if you are a fingernail picker (like a classical guitarist, which I am not because I dislike long grey nasty fingernails, no offense). Still, I blamed the fault to my lack of skills and perhaps improper ukulele setup, because, well, Aquila is like ukulele string god.\n\nRecently, I decided to purchase more Martin strings to put on my Kala ASLAS, because Aquila + solid spruce top + soprano size = ear piercing high shrill sound. Since Amazon sells M600 as \"add-on\" items, I bought a ukulele song book + 3 sets of these martins.\n\nLong story short: I have just now restrung all my soprano ukues with these Martin M600s, and THEY ARE FANTASTIC. I have fallen in love with ukulele all over again. Sure, the Aquila is bright, happy, and bouncy sounding that is really good for strumming, I feel like they aren't really suited for the smaller size ukes (soprano and perhaps even concert). One of the things I felt was that my concert sounded more clear and pure, with each string singing beautifully when strummed, and that sopranos sounded muddy in comparison. I thought it was just the difference between the two sizes. HOWEVER, with the M600s, my sopranos sound MUCH better. When strummed you can feel and hear each string contributing to the overarching harmony. It is truly beautiful. Also, these clear nylon strings have made arpeggios and classicals much easier and pleasurable to play. Also they sound better.\n\nWith the M600 my ukes have lost a bit of the bounciness that the Aquila gives. However, they were already very uke-sounding ukuleles to begin with, now they sound much more balanced. Below you will find what I thought about the M600 on my ukes:\n\nPono Mahogany Soprano:\n\nTo be honest, I was really disappointed with this Pono when first got it, and I expected the most of it out of the three I have, because Kala is just a cheap brand made in China. Pono is still made in China, but they have their own factory (Kala shares factory space with Lanikai and many other uke makers), own training and culture, and they are all inspected and set up in Hawaii at the Koolau factory. However, there was nothing special with the sound - with stock strings it sounded dead, and with Aquilas it sounds bouncy and bright but not as fun as the Kala soprano.\n\nWith the M600, I can finally understand why mahogany soprano ukuleles were so so so popular back then. The factory strings really muted out the sweet and docile tone, while the Aquila strings overrode the tone with its own bright bouncy sound. However, with the M600 everything is balanced and nice. I can really hear the wood sing!\n\nPutting M600 on my Pono also took care of some weird issues I had with tuning and buzzing. Now the friction tuners work wonderfully and I actually love them now (before the M600s, I was ready to swear off of friction tuner ukes for the rest of my life). The pono now strums and picks beautifully, sounding sweet and clear as ever.\n\nKala Soprano Lacewood:\n\nIt is now less edgy, THANK GOODNESS! This uke sounded so bright that videos of it causes my speakers to buzz. Now it still have that hard, clear spruce tone, minus the over-bounciness and edginess. It is still a bit bright, but compliments the mellow Pono perfectly.\n\nTuning and playability have also improved, just as with the Pono. I must sound like I work for Martin but swear I don't. With the Kala I always had problem with the E string staying in tune (even took apart the friction tuners, put together and restrung, and tightened the screw). However, after restrung with M600 it has stayed in tune since!\n\nAnyway, these are awesome. Aquilas are over-used everywhere now and I think people are realize it is just a hype. Aquila strings really make lower end ukuleles sing, such as with the Makala Dolphine, that the bounciness works very well with the dolphine's plastic body. However, if you have a solid instrument, Aquila does not really add much to it. Even my Makala Pineapple, now that I think about it - I had so much fun with it BECAUSE it was strung with the martins! After I got my other ukes (remember, they came with extra sets of Aquilas), I restrung my Makala with the Aquilas, and quickly lost interest in the Makala.\n\nThe end.","summary":"TEH BEST STUFF","unixReviewTime":1366934400,"vote":33.0,"style":null,"image":null}

The screw that came with the Schaller lock was too skinny and couldn't get a bite into the wood.  And I could not use the original Epiphone screw because the head of the screw would not fit into the Schaller lock.  I then installed these Dunlop strap locks on the same guitar with good results.  I also installed these Dunlops on an Epiphone Les Paul ES Pro and an Epiphone Viola Bass guitar.  For the Epiphone Les Paul ES Pro and the ES339, I did not need to do any drilling and the new screws got a good bite into the wood.  But, on my Epiphone Viola Bass...when I was installing the provided screw near the neck...the screw hit something solid which might have been the truss rod.  I had to cut-off about 1\/3 of an inch on the screw to make it fit.  Again, I could not use the original Epiphone screw because it just doesn't fit the Dunlop lock.  As others have mentioned, the Dunlop locks \"stick out\" about 1 1\/8 inch from the guitar when the strap is attached.  It looks a little weird, but I'm sure I'll used to it.

I can tell that the wood was cracked before it was painted because the paint flows into the crack in one instance on the back, is visible up over the \"shoulder\" close to the strap peg and can be seen under the paint on the front. In another instance the paint bridges a crack on back below the cutout shoulder and can be seen under the paint in the right light front and back. Is this normal? (There was no sign of shipping damage on either the outer carton or on the inner product box). Regarding playing, the bass strings buzz on the frets when fretted (not my fingers) which probably can be corrected by adjusting the bridge. I was under the impression that Epiphone guitars were ready to use right out of the box. I have contacted Epiphone\/Gibson company to advise on the cracks and the buzzing bass strings. I am concerned that the cracks may get worse, and if this is this normal for a guitar in this low price range made in china. I got a reply from Gibson Customer Service which said \"We would need to see pictures, but it would be highly unusual if there actually were cracks in the wood. The set up on an instrument can shift during shipping and handling, so a new instrument may need to be set-up.\" I will probably return this instrument and buy one in person from a music store where I can see and try the product before buying it.\n\nUpdate:11-12-15. I discovered another crack in the vicinity off one of the screws that holds the neck on. I sent several pictures to Gibson Products\/Epiphone a few days ago but have yet to receive a reply. It seems to be a pretty good guitar but I expected it to not be cracked. Guitar was made in China.

Now I really wanted to learn how to play. This was not one of those \"maybe\" kind of purchases for me. I give lessons now. I know a thing or two.\n\n If you're getting this because you're not sure if you, or the person you're gifting this to, really has the interest then by all means get one. However, plan on replacing it fast. It's cheap for a reason and it feels cheap. With guitars, you get what you for up to a certain price point. This is an OK starter guitar for someone who may not have the drive or patience.\n\nIf you're looking at this as a first guitar and you plan on playing, learning, practicing then pass on this. Epiphone makes great guitars and for double the price you get a much better feeling and sounding instrument. I've played on more than of these and a common issue is staying in tune and not sounding right in anyrhing but standard tuning. For examoleexample, if you want to learn metal this guitar will not satisfy you.\n\n The epiphone les paul standard, typically around $300 is where you should go. They fret easier and sound richer. You may also want to check out a fender telecaster modern player around the same price. It's a different feel due to the maple fretboard and really is fantastic for chords - where all beginners should start anyway.\n\nI've gone through a number of guitars since I bought one of these. The lesson learned is when you get to the $300 - $500 you'll get quality not only in build but in comfort and tone.\n\nI love epiphone, but depending on your level of interest in the guitar this particular model may be something to pass on. Go put your hands on one of these at guitar center and then compare to a slightly more expensive lp standard. There's a difference and it does matter. Try various models and pick the one that fits your hands, your body, and whispers \"buy me\". Craigslist is full of blind buys for a reason.","summary":"If you're serious about learning pass on this","unixReviewTime":1446681600,"vote":null,"style":null,"image":null}

Walczak","reviewText":"While I've been using Ernie Ball Earthwood strings for a while now, I have to say this is the first time I've tried the 12 string version. The Ernie Ball brand is certainly no stranger to those of us who've been playing guitar for a while and like their infamous \"Slinky's\", the Earthwood strings certainly deliver the goods.  Having used the Earthwood's almost exclusively on my 6 string acoustics (when I can find them locally at least), I was curious as to how these would sound on my Ovation Standard Balladeer (which until recently has been getting Martins).\n\nI'm not gonna bs anyone into believing that these will make your 12 string play like a 6 string...those familiar with 12 string guitars know better.  That said, I did notice a distinct difference in \"feel\" between these and the Martins I've used in the past...these are nicer to play and they do seem to be more gentle on the fingers.  I was concerned with how this \"silk wrap\" was gonna affect the over-all sound of the strings, as well as whether it would cause any tuning issues...I don't typically go in for gimmicks, however I must say that I'm quite pleased with the tone these are producing on my Ovation.  Very nice quality to the sound to say the least and so far (once they stretched in of course) they've stayed right on the money as far as the tuning goes.\n\nAs my Ovation is an acoustic\/electric, I would also take a moment and say that these do sound just as lovely through an amp as they do unplugged.  While I don't actually use an amp that's specifically for acoustic guitars, through my Lab L5 the Ovation with these Earthwood's produces a wonderfully natural acoustic sound very similar to running the guitar directly through the PA.\n\nAs this is the first time I've used these, the longevity issue remains to be seen, however having used the 6 string version of Earthwoods for several years now, I'm not too concerned...I suspect they'll hold up well (although only time will tell).\n\nFinally, as the stars suggest, I give these a very solid 5 out of 5...great sound, great feel and very reasonably priced (I was paying around $18 a set for the Martin's, so at just $12 a set, these are a bargain).  I would highly recommend these to anyone with a 12 string acoustic!","summary":"The Ernie Ball brand is certainly no stranger to those of us who've been playing guitar for a while and like their infamous \"Sli","unixReviewTime":1424304000,"vote":4.0,"style":{"Style:":" .009-.046"},"image":null}

That extra length puts more torque onto the screw. Make sense? Unlike the Schaller type locks, where the strap button \"sits on\" the lock and closer to the body, eliminating that extra torque. On my hollow body Taylor T5, this may not be a big deal, but on a heavy guitar like a Gibson Les Paul it can be a big deal.\n\nAlso, my strap ends had double leather so the locks did not fit out-of-the box.

On my really fat strap it took two of us to squeeze the two washers hard enough to be able install it, while on my thin strap there was a lot of space between the washer and strap so I had to wrap it with something to stop it from wobbling around (I used fishing line).

The photos give an idea of what it is but in my opinion it is even better looking and nicer when you feel the fabric and see how well it works.
