I personally find it hard to accept why woman would just walk away and keep the baby a secret from the father even if he had wrong her, but that's just my personal opinion. Still, this story, while polished, just didn't grab me.\n\nBrice Henderson broke away from his controlling father to make his own fortune, by sacrificing everything, including the one woman he loved, but he can afford no distractions. When his personal assistant needed to take sick leave to take care of family, Brice reluctantly agreed to hire a temporary replacement... who turned out to be the one woman he pushed away... Lena Razzi. Lena spent years trying to forget Brice, despite having a daily reminder... a son by Brice that not even Brice knew about. Lena needed the job, even if it's just a temporary gig, to take care of the baby and herself, and Brice hasn't changed. But as they spent more time together, neither can forget the good times they once had. Can Lena tell Brice about their son if she's not staying? Can they rekindle their love... Or was this going to be a flash in the pan like last time?\n\nFrankly, I am tired of books that tout doormat single mom keeping the baby secret as if to spite the (bleep) dad just to prove you don't mean anything to me except as sperm donor, but as soon as they see each other, they got back together. It's basically formula that she won't tell him, believing this second time is temporary as well, then he found out and was pissed off, or he think he's damaged and was too good for her, or vice versa... But eventually they got back together. It's a trope, and this is no exception.","summary":"Single mom ended up as assistant to the one man who got her pregnant... will she tell him about their son?","unixReviewTime":1494633600,"image":null}

Now, theres two things that absolutely ruin thigh highs for me; the first is when the nylon material is cheap quality and you don't even get them on and they snag.  These are NOT those thigh highs.\n\nThese are a very sheer material, so I was worried they would easily rip or get runs in them, but I was able to successfully put them on and wear them for a few hours with no rips or runs.  Obviously they're still nylon and not indestructible, but they aren't cheaply made and going to run as soon as you put them on.\n\nThe 2nd thing that ruins thigh highs for me is when the elastic on the band at the top doesnt keep the thigh highs up.  I don't necessarily want the world knowing Im wearing thigh highs and I don't want to have to tug them up non-stop and these stay up very well.  Theres plenty of elastic on these to keep them in place and not have to constantly adjust.  Im definitely pleased with these thigh highs.\n\nI received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","summary":"Well-made thigh highs that stay in place!","unixReviewTime":1453593600,"image":null}

The material is super soft and very flattering, and it's easy to nurse discreetly in this top. It did take me a few tries to figure out how to get from fully covered to latched without flashing people nearby, but I pretty quickly figured out what worked for me and my baby, and now I don't even have to mess with nursing covers, which is great because my daughter refuses to nurse when covered (and I can hardly blame her). I'm rather large-chested (I honestly don't even know my breastfeeding bra size... I was a 40D pre-baby and those bras are too small now), so I've had a hard time finding nursing tops that are flattering, comfortable, discreet, and modest. This shirt is all of those things. And that's why I have four of them. :)\n\nAt my family's huge Christmas Eve party this year, I couldn't find an empty room to nurse my daughter, so we just found a corner and nursed there (see pic for that outfit). My sister came up and started talking to me and it took her a minute to realize I was breastfeeding, rather than just snuggling my sleepy baby.\n\nI have several other styles of nursing tops and dresses, and this is by FAR my favorite. I recommend it to every breastfeeding mom I know, and I'm about to get a couple for my cousin for her baby shower gift (and possibly the dress of this style for myself, to wear to her shower...).","summary":"Comfy, flattering, discreet--highly recommended!","unixReviewTime":1514764800,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71eG75FTJJL._SY88.jpg"]}

This dress is SO comfortable, and perfect for pregnancy and nursing. The number one thing you want to know when you're nursing is 'can I get my boobs out quickly'?? And this is such a cool dress and it's got the easy access.\n\nI ordered an XL because I usually wear XL shirts and it's comfy for me and fits perfectly. The pictures aren't the most flattering that I'm posting with this, but I will be wearing this to parties and weddings even because I can get my daughter fed right away when she needs it, and it's a way to be dressy without feeling uncomfortable. I love that I can tie it either in the front or the back, if I tie in the front it hangs down the front and if you tie it in the back it's got a much shorter hanging part. Either way, I think it's really pretty.\n\nThe dress itself is soft and the color is beautiful (the lighting in my basement is fluorescent so it's not what you would call great for pictures) but it's actually a really deep purple that looks great with my skin tone. I am hoping to be pregnant soon and I know this will be a perfect way to keep myself comfortable when we may feel our most uncomfortable ever. *I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","summary":"Best dress I've ever bought online and it's wonderful for nursing in!","unixReviewTime":1465603200,"image":null}

The fabric is super soft and it drapes nicely on the body.  It has an almost silky feel to it. The hem of the skirt is well made and double stitched and it hits just below the knee making it perfect for summer. The color isn't the greatest, it would be nicer if it was a deeper saturation to the green, to me it looks more grey than olive but it's still very nice.  It fits as expected, is loose and generous with the fabric around the waist and in the chest area.  Nursing mothers will find this dress allows for easy access and you can use the wrap portion of the dress to discreetly hold the baby as well.\n\nEven if you aren't nursing, this is a loose, flowing dress that is flattering on all figures for the summer.  You can tie the dress in front in different ways too for different looks.  Overall this dress meets my expectations and is well made.  I'd be glad to recommend it to others.  My only complaint really is the depth of color is lacking, aside from that it's great.\n\nI received this item at a discount in exchange for testing and a fair and honest review.","summary":"Love the feel of this fabric - very nice.","unixReviewTime":1465516800,"image":null}

I love that the tie around covers the nursing holes- I have other shirts with nursing holes that I have to watch out for or else I'll hang out of them. The waist is highly adjustable. The neckline keeps my cleavage covered. No problems after washing. I wanted to buy more in other colors, but I'm disappointed that the price has increased since my purchase. It's still worth it.

No longer do I have to freeze (I live in Alaska) with exposed shoulders or be limited to nursing tanks for ease of access. I know I do, but my kid also seems to enjoy feeling the super soft material. It seems to be great for all positions of nursing, including side-laying down. If I'm wearing a baby carrier (baby bjorn) I tie it in the back very low and its still fine. For pumping at work I've been able to use it as a \"hands free\" holder for the pump flanges (albeit a bit precariously). I'm large breasted so that may not work for many people. I bought this in two colors, in Medium and it seems to fit very well overall. The only thing that I dislike is that it is pretty flowy in the front to accommodate pregnant\/postpartum bellies (which it says it does, so I expected). For those of us who have returned to a relatively shaped pre-pregnancy body, it is a bit too reminiscent of maternity wear, but it really does make up for that in all the cuteness and functionality. Id love if they made one specifically for longterm nursing and not paired with maternity. I bought it for my pregnant sister too.

The material is high quality which is hard to tell from the picture as cotton-y looking shirts can vary widely.  It's the thicker type that feels really soft, doesn't wrinkle and holds up really well in the wash.  The shape is very flattering for someone with a huge stomach.  The way it ties just under the chest is slimming for a pregnant woman.  I also love the different ways it can tie - my favorite is wrapping it all the way around and tying in the back.  Because of the nursing slits built into the shirt, this will be great to wear after the baby comes - and even after I stop nursing the adjust-ability of this shirt will be great for when my stomach returns to a normal size.  I also think the length is great as you can wear this with jeans or leggings.\n\nI'm 5'5'' and started out at 130 lbs (but now I am 150 lbs).  I think the medium will fit me throughout my pregnancy as well as when I return to my normal weight.\n\nSUGGESTIONS:  It would be great if this shirt came in 3\/4 sleeve and full length sleeve options as well for all the seasons.  I'd also be interested in more colors and patterns.  Keep the material and length the same though.","summary":"I absolutely love this maternity\/nursing top","unixReviewTime":1456963200,"image":null}

However, a few things prevent me from rating it higher than three stars. First, even with the adjustable straps (which are nice), the chest area is way too low. I'm nursing (one main reason I purchased this dress - it works well for that purpose) and am guessing my bra size to be a 36D, and there is no way I would wear this without something underneath. I wear a nursing bra that looks like a v-neck undershirt under it and it covers better that way. Then I pair it with a shrug and it looks nice.\n\nThe other issue I have with this design is that it's advertised as being red and white. It is so far from being red. It's pink, almost hot pink. I love the floral pattern and birds and everything else about the design, but I was seriously disappointed with the color and never would have bought it had I known it was pink. I just wear a red shrug over it and that makes the pink stand out less without clashing too much.\n\nEssentially, it's a really nice dress if you know what to expect and work with it a bit. Not sheer (I tried a black bra under it and it did not show through), and very flattering. I actually bought another pattern of this dress a few weeks after buying this one because I liked the fit and design so much.","summary":"The fit on this is awesome, and I love the design","unixReviewTime":1471737600,"image":null}

I wasn't sure what size to get when I ordered it, so I got an XL (I'm about 5'7\" and weigh 210lbs). I was pleased to see that this has smocking in the back which gives it a bit of stretch. It is very comfortable, and is exactly the look I was going for. I will probably buy a couple more dresses from this brand, although I may go down a size as I am in the process of losing weight and would like to be able to keep wearing them.\nI added a picture of the back of the dress, one without a petticoat, and the last picture is the dress with a petticoat. I bought \"Vintage Women's 50s Rockabilly Tutu Skirt Petticoat White(L)\" on Amazon to go with this dress.

Fortunately, the elastic band is lenient enough that you can wear athletic shorts with pockets underneath to stash your stuff. And I'm sure you can remove the shoulder pads if you feel so inclined.\n\nThe bald head wig is a shade of sickly yellow similar to latex gloves at a doctor's office.

Handle is bamboo (mine came cracked a bit in the middle but I don't really mind because I'm not taking my costume too seriously). Overall it's just okay.

So I would just recommend that you consider that and if you buy this BRING SCOTCH CLEAR TAPE to help you keep your mask together all night!! It is not something you NEED to buy to make the typical stormtrooper costume better but the mask it provides is definitely way cooler looking and more real than the standard one.

I've been wanting a stormtrooper helmet for a while and I really wanted to get the voice changer version but just couldn't justify the $$ for something I planned on hanging on the wall. And for that, this is perfect! Up close it is obviously not an expensive prop replica, but from across the room on the wall or shelf it is quite convincing. It comes in 4 pieces -- front and back shell and two earpieces that snap on to hold it together. I ended up using clear packing tape inside on the seams to hold it together and that works fine. It is a bit hard to see out of if you decide to wear it, but I can't imagine the more expensive one to be much better in that way. The lenses do seem a bit cheap looking on this one up close, and that is one consideration between this one and the more expensive version, but like I said from a distance this one looks great. Highly recommend as long as you know it isn't 100% accurate.","summary":"Very very nice for the price!","unixReviewTime":1490140800,"image":null}

I wasn't expecting too much for the price I paid, so overall I would say that I got what I expected. The size stated on the outfit was 12-18 months. My daughter is on the small side and this was not big on her at all. At the time she wore it she was 13 months and wearing 9 month clothing.  The quality of the material is pretty low and tore easily during the only time she wore it. In addition, there is a medallion in the center of the dress by the neckline. The medallion is not secured very well and was constantly flopping around and getting in the way. Lastly, the ears that come with the costume are very flimsy and one ear constantly flops over. Overall, if you are looking for an inexpensive Minnie Mouse costume and don't play on using it too much, this may do the job. However, if you are looking for a costume that your child can wear multiple times, this may not work.\n\nCons:\n1) The costume is much smaller than the stated 12 to 18 month size. It fit my daughter who was wearing 9 month size clothes at the time.\n2) The material is not great and the material around the shoulder\/sleeve tore slightly during first wear.\n3) The medallion in the center is not secured well and gets in the way.\n4) The ears are not well made and one ear was folded over.\n5) The buttons on the back of the dress don't secure it very well.\n\nPros:\n1) The price is low, but perhaps still a little too high for what you get.","summary":"Cheap and cheaply made","unixReviewTime":1454371200,"image":null}

For some reason I decided I needed a Stormtrooper helmet to wear with my Utilikilt. I know... an odd combination to some, but makes perfect sense to me. I started looking for helmets here on Amazon and found the one I wanted. Only problem was it costs $150. I actually put it in my wish list to ponder whether I'd be willing to part with $150 for something that I wasn't going to wear that often. Finally decided to go with the economy version and bought this one.\n\nFirst, as others have pointed out, the helmet that ships isn't the one in the photo. The black perforated eye areas actually have smoked gray plastic lenses (thankfully). Most everything else seems to be pretty accurate. Also, as others have pointed out, the helmet is in 4 pieces that don't stay together very well. You'll want some krazy glue or duct tape to make sure you're not fighting with it if you drop it or are a little rough on it. Even when it's put together I can see a bit of a gap on the seam that runs across the top. Not a huge deal as most people won't be able to see it, but it's there.\n\nI'd still like to have one of the better helmets, but until somebody smacks me on the bum with a golden spoon I'll settle for the $22 version. BTW, I also ordered a Stormtrooper white t-shirt (that looks like the torso of the stormtrooper armor) to wear with it. Found it here on Amazon as well for about $20.","summary":"Economical option","unixReviewTime":1349222400,"image":null}

It's probably okay if you really only carry a few things back and forth, or have a set of screwdrivers and wrenches to carry around to jobsites, but most of the little pockets are so constrained that it was not useful for general use by me.\n\nIt is rugged and it weared well for a couple of months, but I had to switch to something bigger and more secure in holding onto its contents. If the main flap went all the way to the bottom it would probably be much more secure -- the top flap barely overlaps the main pocket.

I also wanted them to have a nice appearance and not look like dedicated work suspenders. These were the only ones to fit that criteria for me. The brownish burgundy color is very rich and the chrome buckles and hardware look nice and function well. I had no problem adjusting these suspenders. The range is accommodating from small to large. They can quickly be attached and removed once the loop attachments have been installed on your belt, by using the clasps, for bathroom breaks and such. Four loop attachments are included (one kit). I bought these for casual wear so I removed the heavy shoulder pads. The process is easy. (1) unbuckle both front straps. (2) slide the horizontal chest strap down and off. (3) slide the shoulder pads off. (4) reinstall the chest strap and make up the buckles. Done. You could also slide them off the back by removing the round strap guide (thing) which is how I did it because the chest strap was so tight, I did not think it was supposed to move. It has loosened up some. In the picture the horizontal chest strap appears to be riveted on, but on my suspenders you can slide it and adjust the height. It is tight and requires some force to move, so it does not flop down. I would have actually preferred a chest strap that attached with clamps (clamps that would not scar the leather). That way you could install and remove the chest strap fast, as desired. Mine uses leather loops for attachment. It seems feasible that these loops could loosen as the leather stretches to the point where the strap might fall down, but I could be wrong. They seem a little expensive, but there is nothing really to compare them with. When you actually break these suspenders down into their seperate components there is not a lot to them, but what are you going to do make them yourself (c'mon). They were delivered fast right to my front door by Fed Ex. They can be a little restricting but that is the nature of suspenders. I recently removed the chest strap which makes them a lot more comfortable, but now they have a tendency to migrate down my shoulders a little. They need semi-frequent repositioning. Removing the chest strap would probably not be practical for working applications. As these suspenders break in and soften I can foresee them becoming very comfortable. These are the first pair of suspenders that I have ever owned and I really like them. Everything that It wrote is truthful to Its experierce. This is only Its opinion.

The ad does not say this is an inflatable piece.  He hasn't popped it (yet).  He's used it twice to accent his buzz lightyear costume.  The pack is an appropriate size for him.  There are very thin elastic straps with short Velcro strips to wear it like a back pack.  the problem is to actually wear it the jetpack can't be inflated complete.  The Velcro straps are too small to hold.  I am sure the design was meant to be small to hide the straps however this makes them difficult to stay shut & impossible for my son to put it on himself.  He's an independent kiddo so this causes him some frustration.  He's disappointed I can't inflate it completely for him to wear it.  He calls it broken because the wings sag. There's no separate blow in for the top of the wings or the ends of the wings making it difficult to evenly inflate.  Overall... it's a cute accessory but not worth the buy.  I'll probably try safety pinning to his costume for Halloween but wish I hadn't purchased it for him.

I think in a month it will still be fine, but if I ordered any smaller it would not have fit.  I didn't give it 5 stars only because the hat is so flimsy and has no string or anything to keep it on her head. I'm going to see if we can fashion something to hold it on her.  This is not a high quality costume or anything, it's thin material so if it's cold you will still have to bundle up. I'm not sure if it's cold and we have to layer how this will fit.

They are designed to wear once or twice and they are made of cheap materials in China. This costume falls right into that category. The picture is a styled up version worn by a model, but it's not inaccurate. My advice is to lower your expectations with store bought Halloween costumes and they work out great.\n\nThis fit me well and I am size 14-16. If you are a size 12 this will also work for you well. Made of rather thin polyester crushed velveteen, the edges of fabric aren't hemmed and it comes folded up in a bag so it's a bit wrinkled. Wash before wearing and hang to dry and it looks a lot better. The \"snake\" armband is the loser of this ensemble, as it does not stay on your arm. I wore as a necklace instead. The headpiece is pretty cool looking, but it is like those plastic masks you wore as a kid with elastic around the back of the head to keep in place. In other words, be gentle with the headpiece. I got the Medusa dreadlock auburn wig and slathered on makeup and this looked great as an ensemble.","summary":"Decent Halloween costume.

These new wings, purchased as an addition to his Halloween costume, is likely the best yet, although it does annoy him that he can't lower his wings down.  The inflation is good and stays for days, but it is a safety hazzard as my son walks all over the house and turns and then knocks stuff over!  Thank goodness they are just made of plastic.  The only complaint I have is that I wish the back part didn't inflate as much (it sticks really far off his body and makes it impossible to sit with it on) and wish more air went into the wings so they stayed upright better.  The purple part of the wings gets no air or inflation, only the red and white striped part and the ends.  I hope these wings last a long time because my son wants to wear them all day every day, but at least they are a good price if I need to order a new set.","summary":"Best Buzz Toy Yet","unixReviewTime":1319155200,"image":null}

Even though some of the other options here on Amazon were a bit more accessorized, I liked the color of this one enough to try it. The results were mixed, but more good than bad. I was happiest with the color, since it matches the character's outfit from the movie. We wanted to replicate the iconic look of the characters as closely as possible, and I think we achieved it with this Scarecrow costume. However, it took some doing to get there. First, the costume ran a bit on the small side, so we had to adjust. We added a generous amount of straw to the ends of the shirt and pants sleeves, adding the needed length and giving the costume a more authentic look. It was a simple touch that greatly improved the costume's appearance. The next problem is the hat. You won't be able to use the hat at all. It's a flimsy, foamy little piece of garbage that might as well not even come with the costume. I ordered a separate hat that looked excellent when added to our other enhancements. Like most costumes of this sort you'll find online, this one can be outstanding, but it will take some extra work.

I am a 5'7 size 7 female and this costume fit really weird.  The top was super large.  The sleeves were so long, I pushed the wrists up to my elbows and let the extra fabric fall back over to my wrists.  The ties on the wrists unraveled by the end of the day and it doesn't breathe well at all.  The pants were large in the waist and really short.  They came to the top of my ankles which looked ok but if this was worn by someone taller than 5'7, I'd have to guess they would be way to short.  The costume got a bunch of compliments and it was comfortable to wear other than the heat retention.  I wore spandex workout leggings underneath because the pants were slightly see-through.  The hat was horrible.  Not usable at all.  Really creased to the point it doesn't really look like a hat.  I bought a different hat on amazon to supplement and it was perfect.

These were to replace the really nice leather\/sheepskin slippers that he totally destroyed in only a few months. I figured that the SmartWool socks that I also got him for Christmas would convince him that these Birki's were the way to go....after some encouragement, he started wearing them more often, not just as slippers.  Now almost a year later, he wears them to work, outside to do yardwork, in our grungy basement, and just about everywhere else!  He especially likes the fact that when they get really dirty all  you have to do is take out the footbeds and drop shoes and inserts into a hot bucket of bleach water. Let the shoes soak and\/or scrub them; the uppers wipe dry with a towel and I throw the cork footbeds in the dryer for a few minutes.  The Birki's are a little big large, most of that is width though.  If you wear a 1\/2 size, unless your toes are really long (and be honest!) order a half size smaller because your heel should be cupped at the back of the clog.  There should not be a large space between your heel and the back of the clog - nor should the clog be so loose as to allow your foot to slide around or your toes to be jammed in the front.  I got blue because the supplier was out of black, but that turned out to be a good thing - I can tell the difference between my black pair and my husband's blue pair in the dark.  The blue is a nice darker denim blue - not a girly blue.

I have since tried every type shoe I could find to meet the rigors of my work environment with mixed and only moderate at best, success. I've worn these Birki's for a week now and did expect to need more time to break them in and to have the insoles mold to my foot pattern. Clearly in more time that will happen even more but, I have been very pleased with the level of support these shoes give me at this point.. No sore spots on my feet after long days and in fact, my feet were not painful at the end of the day. Indicating to me adequate support at the arch and other pressure points. Because of the slight heel cup, my feet do not slip out of these shoes as they did in clog type shoes. This is a great safety feature, especially in a fast paced and sometimes messy environment. I normally wear the open foot pattern size and these fit well. No extra room though, so if you have particularly high arches or wide feet these may not work for you. But definitely give them a try. I wear thick socks with mine for additional cushioning. The shoes are quite firm but, not as much as traditional Birkenstocks.  Although made of vinyl\/plastic material do not compare these to the feel of \"Crocs\" There is no comparison to the springy nature. That being said, they are far superior in support. And to my mind, better than going barefoot in that they cradle my feet in a natural position. I have recommended them to my co-workers.","summary":"Looking for hospital work shoes","unixReviewTime":1373760000,"image":null}

I wear this watch to work on most days, and sometimes on the weekend. It looks nice with casual and business-casual work clothes. It's very comfortable to wear, as it's not heavy and the band is flexible. The band also doesn't catch in my arm hairs, like some other metal-banded watched. Unlike others' complaints, mine keeps time well and I've never had the clasp pop open.\n\nI gave it 4 stars for two reasons: 1. The metal area around the watch face picked up light scratches pretty quickly, and 2. today I bumped my wrist against something, and it snagged the band and ripped some of the mesh. It looks like this is a difficult part to find a replacement for, unlike many other watch straps, so I'll have to send it through Skagen's repair center to be fixed.","summary":"Pleased Overall","unixReviewTime":1346112000,"image":null}

The first one got some water in it after wearing it in a jacuzzi so the water resisitant is pretty liberal.  This watch has a very classic look and I frequently get comments on it.  I also own the same one in Black and both are pretty much identical.\n\nSkagen was one of the first brands to go titanium in both the watch and bands and more and more companies are switching.  Titanium is lighter and stronger than regular steel and once you go Titanium, you won't go back.\n\nThis watch has a small face so its perfect for people with average to small wrist sizes.  Some of these watches have faces that are so big its like wearing a tea saucer on your wrist and it's an eysore.  This watch is a revelation to smaller wrists everywhere.  Also the band on this watch does not grab your wrist hair (VERY IMPORTANT!).\n\nOne disadvantage of this watch is the lack of features.  Its got the date and thats about it.  Also the ticking from the watch is loud enought that you sometimes notice it if the watch is within about 2 feet of your ears and the room is silent.  I wouldn't normally go to bed with this watch or store it nearby while sleeping.\n\nBottom Line:  A classy and durable dress watch appropriate for any non athletic situation.

I got it for $100 at a Sunglasses Hut.\n\nTicking: The watch ticks louder at the 9-2 position, inaudible otherwise.  Since I sleep in absolute quiet, I can hear it by my bedside.  I often pick it up off the nightstand and toss it across the room.  Can't hear it unless it is dead quiet and within a few feet.\n\nClasp: After a few years, I had to adjust the catch on the clasp, since it started coming loose (I wear it pretty tight).  I was worried about breaking it off, but I was careful and it worked out fine.\n\nLinks: When I took the links out initially, I used a safety pin. No biggie.  I've adjusted it easily a few times since using the holes for quick adjustment on the clasp.\n\nActivities: I've worn this watch almost every day doing almost anything from working outside to swimming.  I replaced the battery twice, I figure I'm due for another battery change soon. Last time, I did the change myself at Wal-Mart using their tools.\n\nAccuracy: I set the watch EXACTLY to my phone every stupid time change.  I think it loses a second or two every few months.\n\nFinish: Scratches from working outside show up under close scrutiny, but the grey hides it very well.  I never notice it. (we are not talking big scratches... hairline)\n\nWeight: I thought I lost it, and then found it on my wrist a few hours later.  No joke. (in my defense, I was wearing a long sleeve shirt)\n\nIf I lost it: I'd flip my lid.  It is just one of those things that are a part of me.\n\nReports of quality issues: I just bought a second one (just wanted a little variety).  Mine was made ~2001, so they may have had better quality almost a decade ago.

Changing batteries is a pain as you can't find them locally and it costs $14.95. Bands are $34.95. Also you better keep your sales receipt even though they have lifetime warranty.\n\nI sent in my replacement band and battery with payment for two watches in July and they cashed the check and didn't receive anything until January.  I called them and they promised to send a free battery, but when I received the items finally in March, no battery was included (let alone a free one).\n\nOther issues:\n\na) Wire mesh bands: The clasp is not always tight and over time will slide and get a little loose. Also the titanium mesh is made of tiny small circles of metal interlocked and if one of them gets open (say you hit something), it starts unraveling slowly but surely.\n\nb) Leather band: The one I have fell apart so quickly it is surprising. It also started smelling bad due to sweat (I do not sweat that much and I owned other watches with leather bands). This seems to be a very bad quality.\n\nc) Water - my watch started fogging after 2 years of light usage.\n\nI will NOT buy another Skagen watch.

It is by far the best watch I've ever had.  It is so light you don't feel it on.  It's great if you are a cyclist and want to reduce every once of weight on your bike. Quite literally, it is about 1\/3 the weight of an average steel band watch. It has a sleek profile compared to most steel band watches so rarely gets snagged on things while doing work.  The face is also smaller than most  comparable watches.  About 1\/2 way between a normal man's size watch and a womans watch.  I personally like the color of titanium over stainless steel and have received compliments on this watch for that reason.  It is fairly scratch resistant.  I am very abusive with my watches.  I wear them 24 hours a day even while working or in water.  I do a lot of hands on woodwork etc.  I've drug the face across some sharp metal stuff and this has put some light scratches on the face.  Under normal use I suspect it would not get too scratched up.  The band rarely comes unlatched even if you do happen to snag it on something.  The pins have never bent or come out, ever!  I think the titanium latch has better wear over stainless steel watch bands. The pins are probably also made of titanium.  It don't know for certain but given the fact they've never come out I assume so.  Titanium is much stronger than steel.  The band itself is very smooth and comfortable.  It never pinches the skin or feels irritating.  The reason why I have had 2 now instead of one is that I crashed on my road bike during a 30+ mph sprint and it was drug across 10 feet or more of pavement after an initial hard impact.  That broke the face of the watch and put some deep scratches into the titanium but the band never broke or came off.  The hands were still good.  If I remember correctly I think the watch was still working after all that until I started messing with the hands on it.  I paid $100 for it both times.  Now that I see they are a lot less on Amazon I think I'll buy another so if I eventually lose or break this one in maybe 10 years from now I'll have another to replace it.  You will not be disappointed if you buy this watch. You will seriously be saving money because it is nearly indestructible and you won't lose it if you never take it off because the band doesn't ever break or come off the watch.","summary":"Best watch I've ever owned","unixReviewTime":1196985600,"image":null}

I really like it - very light and very stylish.\n\nHOW TO ADJUST BAND\n - as some others have said, this is very difficult.  You can do it yourself though.  You'll see some of the bands have little arrows on them.  These are the ones you can remove.  Do NOT pull on the outside portion of the link - it does not slide out.  You need to place a small pointed object (like an awl) into the hole next to the arrow and use it to push out on the inside piece.  This is a U-shaped piece.  You can slide it out a few millimeters, then carefully grab it with a small pair of pliers and pull it out the rest of the way.  (once its out a little ways, you can slip the awl back into the slot and use that to pull it out the rest of the way... I found that easier)\n\nOnce you get two (or more) of them apart, you can remove the other link parts and put it back together.\n\nNOTE:  This is a bit tricky and you have to be careful not to scratch anything.  If you aren't comfortable with it, I'd take it to a jeweler.  On the up side - if you need to remove a link, just try it on that one link.  If it gets scratched, you are removing it anyway!","summary":"Great watch - tips for adjusting band","unixReviewTime":1185494400,"image":null}

I did this because I wanted to be able to wear leggings under the dress because sometimes it is a tad cold here on Halloween.  Yes, the back of the dress is a solid pink but it just a costume and one at a decent price.  Yes, the wig could use more yarn.  Personally, I think you could add more to it pretty easily if you are even the slightest bit crafty.  I am just going to wear it as is.  I am a school teacher and I think my students will love it and not really care about the wig.  This will not be winning any Cosplay awards but then that is not its purpose.

Also, when I read other reviews that mentioned the back panel was all pink, I thought they meant just the back but actually the whole back side of the dress is pink and see through. The wig is more of a Raggedy Ann style and is totally bald - like a reverse mullet. I bought a different wig for the costume and was again grateful for all of the other reviews so I wasn't surprised. For a costume company this item was made very lazily. Also, it is printed so would it have been so difficult to just print on the back too?

It wasn't available a few years' back.  I had wanted to make a Maleficent costume that I could wear every year, sort of as a signature party piece.  I was looking at this costume out of curiosity, to see if I could buy the dress\/cape part only.  It seems that I cannot and that it may not be as good as the costume that I rigged up on my own.  I think that some reviewers were unhappy with the hat that comes with this costume, as well as some others who wanted only the dress\/cape piece.  I think that the hat that was originally sold on Amazon is wonderful.  It needs some stabilizing (minimal adjustments of the chin straps, typical with good headpieces).  I made the outer cape out of a black cape that I found at GoodWill, and I added some purple remnants from fabric store to wear as the inner piece.  I found a short burgundy dress from a clearance aisle at Target which made for a good under piece as it's cold here late October.  Interestingly, when I went out trick-or-treating with my niece. who was 11 at the time, she said, \"Aunt Marlie, you look scary.\"  I found a large fleece, green\/black\/purple polka dotted  jacket at GoodWill, and I had some black loose pants. I also had one of those crazy scarves that women were wearing a few years back, all ruffled.  Now, I can wear the hat as a part of a clown costume when I'm with kids, as well as becoming scary Maleficent when at adult parties.  I'd say, buy the good hat, if the reviews are discouraging to you in terms of the whole outfit or if you like the ways in which I use the hat for costuming.  If you like to have fun by making some of your costumes on your own, the head piece gives it a professional finish, while you get to create the rest.  As you can tell, I just loved this Maleficent hat.","summary":"The 5-stars is for the original, well-made hat, a better choice","unixReviewTime":1440201600,"image":null}

For less than $5, I bought fabric glue, black felt, stuffing material, and thin purple ribbon. I enhanced the horns by making them 3-D which helped them stay up and look authentic. I then glued on the purple ribbon like Maleficent has (see the expensive headpiece that is for sale). The foam is black but the edges are grey, so i took a black sharpie and colored along all the edges. This is now an EXCELLENT costume!

They essentially have their own sizing system since the design is so old.  Get the smallest you can that isn't uncomfortable.\n\nSecond, the \"burgundy\" Converse is really more of a eggplant purple.  Too purple for me, so I used some orange (\"Tangerine\") Rit dye which, when combined with the eggplant purple of the shoe, turned them a deep blood red which I really like.  Follow the instructions on the dye and you'll be fine.\n\nFinally, these aren't really comfortable shoes.  They offer no support and I believe they're overpriced.

In expensive dress shoes and tennis shoes, I almost always wear a size 9 1\/2.....never a 9 but sometimes a 10. I ordered a size 9 in these shoes and they looked  like 'clown shoes' on my feet. I returned them and ordered a size 8 and they are just about perfect although ever so slightly larger than my usual shoes. I can't imagine why they use such unusual sizing but I hope this information will be helpful. If you order a size and a half smaller than usual, I feel sure they will be right...or very close.\n\nNow......the not so good part. I am 66 years old and grew up wearing Converse tennis shoes all through the 1960s; they were great shoes in every respect. If your experience is similar, you will immediately realize that these shoes are in almost no way, comparable.

Roomy in the toe, not at all difficult to get on, expectedly snug around the ankle. But I found it was more comfortable to stand on my hard wood floor in SOCKS than it was to stand around in these shoes.\n\nI'm not entirely sure whose idea it was to put a hard layer of stitching right on the back of the ankle, but THIS IS THE WORST THING. My first time wearing them I walked to dinner and back in them - no more than an hour round trip - and on the way back I could barely walk right because the shoes had already torn the skin off the backs of my ankles. Through my socks. I have of course had to wear in shoes before, but you can't wear in something you're afraid to put on again.\n\nThey do look good. It's a classic sneaker look.

The toebox is far too small, way to narrow and cramped for your toes to spread out. There were some Loose Fit Oxes once upon a time, but Converse refuses to make them anymore. They want to crush our feet into some narrow ideal foot shape for reasons beyond my comprehension. I have also read that the soles separate very easily from the main shoe now with the new models So these are utter crap now.\n\nTIP: Avoid Vans because while they allow your foot more room, your heel will slide in and out of the shoe. You can use Feiyues, but there are no solid black styles. However they are the most comfortable, and will not allow your heel to slide in and out.","summary":"NOT a good minimalist shoe option.

The old made in USA versions were actually better, better rubber material and better fit for me.  But these will do.  For me it isn't fashion.  I've worn them when they weren't popular, they made a statement. It was dare to be different. At my age now it is still the same. No Swoosh shoes or Topsiders in my closet.  Maybe Vans sometime for the right price, but the hi-tops are my favorite.  I did the same wearing Shuron Ronsir ZYL glasses before the trend.\n\n Unfortunately that statement that I don't follow trends, gets diluted when my favorite foot wear becomes a trend.  All the kids following the trend has driven prices up ten times what I used to pay for a low buck cloth shoe.  But with some careful shopping I am able to save about 40% off retail.  That and Nike bought out Converse, then proceeded to off shore production.  Such is life.\n\nLike my old Converse tee shirt said, \"Make an impression\".","summary":"The old made in USA versions were actually better, better rubber material and better fit for me","unixReviewTime":1498176000,"image":null}

That is not the case with these shoes. They look great and feel great, too.\n\nCanvas shoes have flat bottoms and thus have no arch support. I have high arches, so usually flat soles translates into awkward stepping and discomfort. Not so with these shoes. I attribute this to how snugly they fit; when they're all laced up a large percentage of the surface area of the shoe is in direct contact with my foot. This means a large percentage of the mass of the shoe moves along with my foot, as opposed to being pulled along by the foot with each step. In a practical sense, this creates a \"barefoot\" effect, and indeed it feels like I'm not wearing any shoes at all.\n\nAdditionally, they're well-aerated so my feet stay cool and don't sweat. The heel is high enough that the backs stay securely in place. They're light and very flexible. The fit was perfect; exactly as expected. Finally, they feel very solid, durable, and well-made. Not a shred of buyer's remorse for this impulse buy.","summary":"The best shoes I've ever owned","unixReviewTime":1494288000,"image":null}

I am a rural postal carrier, so they get alot of use when I work in the warm months, they are perfect for walking around at a theme park, walking the dog and whatnot. I wouldn't wear them if you plan on walking a few miles or more, because you will get blisters! Otherwise, they are a great feel even for wide feet.

The Champion one pushed my boobs in so much it made that ugly boob bump above the bra line that's visible in light t-shirts - ew - and they're supposed to be the same bra size so go figure.  More positives: this one also fastens securely (just start from the bottom and work your way up, it will fit!) and is super, super comfortable.

I got mine on e-bay.","summary":"It Works!","unixReviewTime":1112313600,"image":null}

If you want something designed for *high* impact then this should be your go to. This will take care of you while you do everything from burpees to jumping jacks to high knees. A lot of people do not like that the band can run tight but its designed to compress and support the breasts. I will grant you that they aren't the cutest design but if it worries you that much then throw a cute top on over it. You're there to work and this bra is there to support and protect you every step of the way while you do. Breast tissue is very delicate so don't risk injury or discomfort for the sake of looking good. You'll look and feel better being lean and fit without injuries. It is on the expensive end but consider it an investment that you won't regret. With proper care mine have lasted several years. Enell uses high quality material and its designed to last.

I had been looking for something that would keep me motionless up top as I run and jump rope. I might add that I've never spent what amounts to the annual salary of a worker in an underdeveloped nation for one exercise bra. It's quite ridiculous especially when considering what I'm about to say...\n\nOh, don't get me wrong. It looks quite formidable--just like the pics, but au contraire. I was excited as I put her on for a test drive this morning. It looked pretty inconspicuous under my clothes-- a good sign I told myself. I walked a couple laps around the track then picked up my jump rope and proceeded to jump & JIGGGLLLLEE-- yes ladies-- jiggle. I'm reeeeaally disappointed because I'm rather shy and needed something that would allow me to jump rope sort of unnoticed while out in public. It looks like it'd probably serve well as a bust minimizer, but it's not my idea of a truly supportive exercise bra.\nAnd, it's certainly not worth the $64 I paid.\n\nTo be even more candid, I get more support from my 12+ year old \"champion\" exercise bra!

I ride horses, and wear a 36DDD bra, so I need really good support when running\/riding\/doing anything more energetic than walking.  I've spent a fortune on sports bras looking for the right one, and I've found a lot of good ones.  This one is GREAT.  Really.  It's fantastic.\n\nThe Pros:\n- Once you're in, you're in, and you're not going anywhere.\n- The band isn't restrictive - it didn't impact my breathing like some bras do, and it is definitely more comfortable than wearing two (or three) sports bras at once.\n- Having a front closure (versus just trying to shimmy your way into a sewn top with no closures) is essential in a sports bra for well-endowed women, and this one doesn't disappoint.\n- It has a very high neckline, so the girls don't spill out of the top or sides.\n- Super, supreme, amazing bounce control.  I don't feel like I'm being pornographic while exercising anymore.\n- It MINIMIZES.  So for those of you who ride horses and are looking for a bra to help you fit into your show coat better, this is the bra for you.  No more gaps between my show coat or show shirt buttons!!!\n\nThe Cons:\n- It's UGLY.  I don't mean cute little bulldog ugly.  I mean embarassing uncle you avoid at family reunions ugly.  You will not go running in a pair of capris and just this bra.  You will hide it with layers.  Ideally thick layers, because the seams are hideous.\n- It takes an act of God and a willing partner to get into.  I was actively sweating by the time I got the thing on the first time.  I can usually get my husband to help now - A third arm is useful.\n- The fabric looks and feels cheap, and I'm concerned it won't hold up over time.  I guess I shouldn't really list this as a con because it hasn't fallen apart or anything yet...I guess I just expect more quality for the price.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this bra.  It's the best I've found so far for the type of exercising I do, and the pros significantly outweigh the cons!","summary":"Best Sports Bra I've Found!","unixReviewTime":1434412800,"image":null}

I don't like the underwire bras.  They have never fit me well, and usually, the wires work their way out,  But, I have rheumatoid arthritis, and I can't manage bras that clasp in the back.  I don't have the flexibility to reach back, or the strength to twist the bra to put the clasp in the back.\n\nIt fits more like the upper half of a tank top, and in the summer, it can be very warm.  It is heavy.  It is not a lightweight, thin fabric garment.  So, it isn't the bra I'd choose in July, on a 100 degree day, to go to an amusement park or outdoor activity, even though I know the back support would be wonderful.  But, inside, and the rest of the year... it is so comfortable....  and it provides support for my back.  I was astonished at the effect on my back.  Also, as other women have said, you DO NOT move.  At all.  It is wonderful support.  I was reluctant to spend the money when I could not try it on first.  I asked at area shops (the real undergarment ones), and oddly, no one had heard of them.  But, a friend was so adamant that I tried it.  As long as you take accurate measurements, you will be fine.  The charts are accurate.  They aren't frilly and fancy, but the frilly and fancy ones don't provide support to the front, or to my back, and who sees it under clothing?  Comfort is the goal.  I generally pay $50 for a bra, but, these last much longer than the front closure mastectomy bras I buy.  My only complaint is that they are heavy, but, without the construction, I'd have no back or chest support.","summary":"Excellent back and chest support","unixReviewTime":1430352000,"image":null}

I am a competitive, thin, fit 44 yo with 34F busts so over the years certain body parts have moved a bit southward and there is a lot of potential for jiggling to outright flopping. In this Enell Sport Bra I can run and jump with no unwanted movement. It is a compression bra, so you are going to have a mono-boob, but it is the only bra I can run in that does the job without chafing. And when I am working out hard I'm a make-up-less, hair-puled-back, sweaty mess, so what do I care if I have one compressed motionless boob?\n\nMost of the negative reviews of this bra are folks who couldn't get into it, so I figured I would tell you the easiest way:\n1. First put your arms through the arm holes as though you were putting on a vest.\n2. Leave your boobs where they are: if they are down by your lower rib cage, your belly button or tucked into your waistband, just leave there.\n3. Grasp your Enell Sports Bra by the bottom two front clasps and lift up (vertically) so you are NOT pulling it across your boobs, but over the top of your boobs across your chest at arm pit height.\n4. Hook the bottom to clasps so that the bra is closed at the bottom but contains no boobs.\n5. Using your right hand, go through the inside of the bra and scoop up your left boob and pull it into the bra. Do the same with your left hand, right boob.\n6. Arrange your boobs so they are comfortable and facing the same general direction, then easily hook the rest of the clasps from the bottom up.\nTa-Da!\n\nI will say this is a LOT of bra. If you are a cup size C or smaller this may not be the bra for you. If you do not do a lot of high impact movements (running, jumping, karate, burpees, pogo-sticking) you probably do not need a bra this sturdy. For example, I do not need to wear my Enell when I am weight training or biking. However, if you are an older lady who maybe has had a couple of kids and gravity has done its thing, this may be the bra for you; or if you are a younger gal who is well endowed and have seen your mother naked and don't want the same fate to befall you, then you may want to wear a Enell to ward off the horrors of gravity for as long as possible.","summary":"How to get into your Enell Sports Bra","unixReviewTime":1423440000,"image":null}

I will admit that for about 5 milliseconds I had a mixture of shock, and a strange sense of pride, but I digress...\n\nWith the friend's wedding looming near, I headed back to a workout schedule that had long been abandoned.  I went to bootcamp and trampoline fitness class and within 3 seconds of starting squat jumps, I was mortified that my DDs were flying all over the place.  Oh yeah.. I forgot to get a new sports bra since my girls grew exponentially!\n\nI searched high and low on the internet, and this bra topped many lists as the best for larger-busted women.  I was hesitant to pay $64 for a sports bra, but SOMETHING needed to be done!  Thankfully, Amazon is quick with delivery (seriously, ya'll - the Prime membership is TOTALLY worth it).\n\nI received it quickly and the first thing I did was try it on.  I put my arms through, and thought \"There is no way this thing is going to close up!  There must have been a mistake... Did I get the right size? Should I have ordered the next size up?\"\n\nThe truth is it just looks like it won't fit, but it will.  Hook the bottom 2 first, adjust the girls a bit, and it should be easier to hook up the others up the front.\n\nAfter that done, I jumped around, did some squat jumps, some burpees, and any other exercise that I could think of that extremely embarrassed me only days before because of my old sports bra.  NO MOVEMENT WHATSOEVER.  I was amazed.\n\nThe true test, I thought, would be making it through a trampoline fitness class since we are literally jumping up and down in different ways for an hour straight.

Don't even think twice, just buy it.\n2) Go to the Enell website to find your size.  I used their measurements and it fit perfectly\n3) To put it on, don't freak out.

I drive a tractor 10 hours a day, 4 days a week so I give this thing a run for the money! People stare just because I'm a woman, no need to add bouncing boobs to the show! The first week I wore this was pretty rough. The lower elastic band hurt & my twisting to the right while driving 10k times per day caused chafing. I put a bandage over the chafing & continued wearing it. I wash it & hang it to dry at night so it's ready to go at 5am the next morning. I highly recommend visiting the manufacturer's website & measuring to make sure you order the correct size. The price is pretty high for a bra, but I have found that to get a good bra I have to spend about that much anyway. In order to get a good fit, I usually go to the high-end stores and endure a fitting that makes me feel as the fitter should've at least bought me dinner first. So it was nice to get a good fit without that experience. My triple Ds make me look larger than I am so I enjoy the lift & minimizing effect the bra gives. There is, however one MAJOR drawback. You can see in the picture a distinctive line on the bra where a standard bra would typically end. THIS IS VISIBLE THROUGH A SHIRT! That gives the look that I'm wearing some sort of fancy bustier or something. I've caught more than one guy staring. Remove that line & I'd give it 5 stars any day.","summary":"Perfect tractor accessory","unixReviewTime":1405123200,"image":null}

Plus, the other sports bras I use, my size was ALWAYS sold out at the store (Lane Bryant), and I've even had my online orders canceled because they were sold out.  I'm a pretty active (5-6 days a week) plus sized woman.  I do cardio at the gym, as well as a yoga sculpt class that is more HIIT type of workout.  With my other sports bras, there is a lot of bounce, even doing the elliptical machine.  When I have this sports bra armor on, there is nothing.  Maybe if I jump really fast I get a small amount of bounce, but nothing noticable!\n\nSo, getting into this thing is a feat, but its worth it.  All I could suggest is making sure you have it fitted properly on the arms and side before you start hooking it up because its not going to be moveable afterward.\n\n**Edit\/Update**\nI just wanted to update this review, I've now accumulated 3 of these sports bras and have had them for the last 3 years.  Still look and perform NEW.  No loose threads, no rips, tears, nothing.  I wash them in the machine, then hang dry.  They are worth the money!!!!  I have a Livi by Lane Bryant sports bra that I've had for 2 years and it's stretched out and I barely use it because it hurts my shoulders.  The Livi bra is my \"oh F I forgot to wash my good sports bras\" sports bra.  So, it maybe gets 2 wears a month.  These get used 4-5 days a week, and washed weekly.  They fit as if I bought them yesterday.  LOVE ENELL!!","summary":"The Gymslayer","unixReviewTime":1401840000,"image":null}

It's a relief not to have to wear two bras anymore.  The only drawbacks (aside from the appearance) is: (1) it's very tight around the rib cage, so I had to wear it with the first\/bottom hook unhooked and (2) it feels like you are wearing a breastplate - so, it looks a bit awkward underneath thin, workout shirts.  Also, because this bra is very form fitting and restrictive, it's not one of those sports bras where you can wear all day.  Overall, It is the best running bra available for bigger chested women.

I'm a 38D (I wear a size 2) and I've never found a sports bra that eliminated bounce before this one. I can actually run and not worry about my chest bouncing about! If you don't have a problem with that then you won't fully appreciate how rare it is to find a bra that's comfortable, easy to get in and out of and actually lives up to the claim of eliminating bounce. I only wish I had found this sooner! I've already ordered a second one. I'll never use another brand of sports bra again. It does take some getting used to since it doesn't feel like any bra I've ever had before. My only complaint is I wish there wasn't a seam at the top of the cup- but I guess that can't be helped. The seam is not uncomfortable- just unsightly under tee-shirts.","summary":"Best sports bra I ever owned","unixReviewTime":1313625600,"image":null}

If you need shoes to do back squats with then Chuck Taylors are great becaue they provide you with a hard, flat heel, and they are fairly cheap. I personally like the high tops a lot better because they give you extra anckle support, not to mention they look way cooler too. I bought a red pair of low tops and though I looked ridiculous in them so I returned them. The red color doesn't look as cool as the picture online does, they look like cambells soup shoes. In terms of comfort they are not good at all. The toe area is long and a bit narrow so the sides will may rub against your little toes and give you blisters. As for the sizing, for anyone who doesn't know the sizing chart is horrible. I typically wear a 12 in mens and I fit into an 11 in these, I should probably be a 10.5 but the sides would rub against my toes to point where I would not be able to wear the shoes. I ended up buying the high-tops after returning these and I think they are pretty good for squats, my form is better and I can lift more because of it. I would not recommend these for anything other than lifting, if I was to wear these around all day my feet would hurt and be badly blistered.","summary":"Good for Squatting but not for casual shoes","unixReviewTime":1457136000,"image":null}

I've worn canvas Chucks for years and my kids like them as much as I do. They're great for warmer months since they're not thick\/heavy fabric. They're machine washable and believe me, any shoes that are machine washable are truly a blessing.. Kids shoes + heat = stink foot. They don't fall apart after washing them regularly, so go ahead and run them though the wash when they get a little funky. The high tops that have a white soles tend to get scuffed and dirty pretty quickly but they are easy to clean with a magic eraser-type scrubber, just in case you have some that look a little icky.\n\nTips: they're not the most supportive shoes, but you can add an athletic insole to increase the amount of cushion and support. If you ordered them online and they're too large, you can buy an athletic insole and put it in the shoe to take up some of the slack. Works like a charm. You might want to go to a real shoe store and try on a few pairs of high top Converse so you can determine what size you wear before buying them online. Chuck Taylor High Tops fit differently than other athletic shoes so you might want to try on a few pairs of low tops and high tops to see what feels best. If your foot runs narrow, and these feel a little too wide, add an athletic insole. If they're too snug, you're gonna have to return them and order up a size because they don't really stretch out. The laces tend to wear out long before the soles do, but that's my experience. And yes, I am in love with add-on athletic shoe inserts to make shoes fit better and to make them more comfortable. I have taken inserts from my Nike running shoes and put them in my Converse when I'm going to be on my feet all day but the best insert you can buy are Run Pro and they're worth every freakin penny. Your mileage may vary.","summary":"Love how they look, love how they feel. Get some Chucks now.","unixReviewTime":1486339200,"image":null}

These are exactly the same ones I have been buying in the store, but I can no longer find half-sizes in the stores, so I checked Amazon.  I wish I had been buying them here all along - no searching the stores, and they arrived quickly.  You should note that the sizes listed are women's sizes.  If you've never worn Converse before, the sizing is pretty accurate.  I wear a 9 in most Clark's shoes, and a 10 in some other brands, and for the Converse I wear a 9-1\/2.\nAt least one other reviewer said that her shoes did not come in a shoe box... I'm not sure how often that happens, but I can say that mine arrived in the regular Converse shoe box.","summary":"Exactly like the ones I have been buying in the store; sizes listed here are women's sizes","unixReviewTime":1369958400,"image":null}

They are sturdy canvas that wears extremely well over time. The soles are rubber and glued. After extreme wear, some parts that are glued can get loosened. Shoe goo can be used to make most if not all repairs on these. So they can last longer than nearly any shoe. They make them exactly like they did decades ago, with the same quality, with one caveat, Converse, the iconic American shoes, are now made in China. This may or may not matter to you. It does matter to me, due to labor practices, and environmental standards, which is why I typically buy New Balance shoes, still made in the USA as of 2013. I've worn made in USA converse in the past, but never the new China-made ones. On arrival I couldn't tell any difference in the shoe itself, just as sturdy as ever.\n\nOn a side note: This particular style is pretty trendy among celebrities. My wife saw this color\/style on some female singer and had to have them. Lots of female celebrities buy these \"male\" high-tops. Which I find interesting, it doesn't look bad at all, but it definitely screams trendiness to me. You can google \"celebrity Converse\" to find pictures of the myriad of celebs who don Converse. If you do or do not want to be trendy, is your call, but these are definitely being revived in current \"pop culture\". To my wife, that is great, emulating her favorite artist, to me, I wouldn't be caught dead in them due to that reason alone. Although I thought about buying a matching pair just to confuse her, and be \"that\" weird matching couple, since pop culture has made them unisex lol.\n\nHope that helps!","summary":"Long lasting","unixReviewTime":1377734400,"image":null}

From $54.99 to $34.99!! Tried men size 6.5(womens 8.5), still too big, men size 6(women 8), perfect! If you order them here order them at least a whole size smaller. They really run big.
