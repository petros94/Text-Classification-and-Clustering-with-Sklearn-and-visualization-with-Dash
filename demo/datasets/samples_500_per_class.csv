2,2,985,"For years I carried a Land's End Square Rigger, which at the time was a great canvas attache.
Got away from those because I wanted something classier, in leather.
After many years i realized that leather was heavy so went to get another one, but Land's End had changed and the reviews of the new bags turned me away.

Wanted something lightweight with loads of pockets, accessible from the top, with a handle as well as shoulder straps, with a rear slip pocket and could be stuffed without breaking the zipper.
Made a few mistakes along the way, and somehow came across this bag.

I like it more than my old Land's End bags.
There are two large pockets instead of the one, with access from the top for one and a flap cover for the other.
The flap can be easily opened with one hand while on the shoulder.
The organizational possibilities are outstanding due to the pocket arrangement and the number of them.
It's lightweight, not overly large, and can be stuffed without worry.
Can carry it by the handle without closing the flap cover.

It's not canvas, but I like the material, which should show less wear and tear in the long run.
Not crazy about the color, but can live with it.
Marking it down 1 star because of it.

Happy with the bag.",clothing

11,11,8405,"Slightly more narrow than expected.  Eventually, after several months of walking and weightlifting in these shoes, the canvas upper cracked where my toes meet the rest of the foot.  I guess the constant bending right at that point caused the eventual break.  I can still wear them but they don't look great.

Before that, great shoe.  Good lifting shoe, but also a good, casual sneaker for everyday wear.  Also, order a size down from your typical shoe.",clothing

16,16,1271,"Received in a timely manner, no holes or poor construction once received.  My only beef with it is that the wings ride so high on the back that the edges of the body of the pack touch the top of the head.  The pack only stays as low as it is in the picture when there is no movement.

Otherwise, my son loves the fact that he can be just like Buzz Lightyear.",clothing

22,22,1161,Even after growing out of the costume my  4 year old son loves to put these wings on and pretend to fly around the house. They have held up for a year of being banded around and re-inflated at least once a week. The only down side to these is that they go on the shoulders via elastic pieces that connect by Velcro.  The Velcro hasn't worked very well since we first purchased them. On Halloween we actually taped them together.,clothing

They are described as:
  ""Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Lo Top Black Canvas Shoes with Extra Pair of White Laces men's 14 ""
Unfortunately, the Extra pair of laces didn't come the the sneakers.
(Who the heck calls these ""Canvas Shoes"" anyway? They're SNEAKERS or CONS)
Solutions offered:
  1. Return for full refund (Nope, they fit and I like them)
  2. Credit for the price of a pair of Shoe Laces.
I took number 2.

Original Review:
Size Issue. I really believed the recommendation Amazon gave me and so bought a SIZE 13 when my regular size is 14. I returned the 13's and will probably purchase pair of size 14's.

So Amazon recommended a Size 13 and of course the ""product fit"" is ""Too small"" and the width is ""Somewhat narrow"".",clothing
43,43,1592,Product is nice but if you buy it make sure to run to the store and get some safety pins as the tiny patch of Velcro does not stay secure and the whole costume comes forward causing children to trip,clothing

He refuses to tie the shoe, but the fit and comfort level and the quality of the shoe he says meets the standard you would find from a converse that you'd get from the store. This converse is the older model, they have a newer model on the market now that they sell at Journeys and stores like that. I don't know how to explain the difference but they do look pretty different. my boyfriend loves the older model so he was excited to get these.",clothing

54,54,7100,Got them in only a few days. They're exactly what I ordered. They are a little bit snug in the toe but its OK. My old pair stretched out after a little bit of breaking them in.

Definitely worth the order!,clothing

Light, flat footed

I have not been on any headlines, so, many calls me an amatuer.
However, according to the late and grate Gordon Pirie, running shoes need to be light.
FInd and read his book, which stated that  Many running shoes were designed incorrectly.

Chuck Taylors are designed with simple flat, and light weight features.
Great for running.  Did you know they were the standard at one time for recruits in the US military ?

Converse Chuck Taylor need a little modification, such as an extra insole
R-Gear The Stealth Insole
from roadrunnersports dot com.

And add a little outsole with superglue / crazy glue, or shoe goo, so that the outsoles can be ""refreshed.""
Converse and its corporate owners won't like this.

But to be foot injury free, everyone needs to walk without shoes.
And do your squats.",clothing

68,68,1561,"I ordered these for my fiance who is a chef and works on his feet all day. He has an old pair and I figured these were the same because they are the same brand. Boy was I wrong. The ""cork"" footbed that it claims supports your arch is solid as a rock and not practical for any type of use. He couldn't imagine how he would even walk in them. In the picture they look different once you try them on. Most of your heel stikcs out and there isn't a lot of coverage. On the description it says these are great for gardening. There is no way you could wear these in the garden without getting your foot dirty or without your foot sliding out. I don't know if these are a new version of the typical Birkenstock or what. The information included in the package is not user friendly and in another language. Definitely not satisfied with these, returning them today.",clothing

75,75,8635,"DISCLAIMER: For those of you getting Converse shoes for the first time, please go try on a couple of pairs before you purchase. Luckily for me I bought a couple pairs from stores like Ross and gotten pairs from base exchanges. It does help since I hear these things about the different sizing for Converse shoes.

So some may be wondering about the Chucks. They are indeed actual Converse shoes. I picked a pair in blue from Ross a couple months back and the unbleached white ones I received now are the exact same. It's Ross, and they sell name brands. I mean, come on. Anyway, the loop on the tongue is interesting, but that just may be because of where they are made. I have a pair of high tops in grey (also from Ross) that don't have that loop on the tongue. The cream and blue ones I have are made in Vietnam while my grey pair are from Indonesia, BUT the tell signs are there for Chuckie T's. Felt soles, clear badge on the side, bold name inside the shoe and that they feel fantastic to wear. Slight design differences like the tongue loop and the heel logo, but it's still the same overall. Same shoe, different design. I do look forward to getting another pair.",clothing

These are the original version, not the new version with the supposed better arch support, but there is nothing wrong with the originals. We both grew up on them, and this pair was for our teenager. He loves them, which just goes to show teens ARE capable of good judgment - at least when it comes to shoes.

They run about half a size larger than other shoes, and I do wish they would come in half-sizes but they are still so awesome I won't even dock a star for that. Even half size off they still fit without slipping or causing discomfort. These are just the best gall-durned shoes on the planet.",clothing
173,173,9680,"The Healthy Back Bag is a cross between a shoulder bag and a backpack.  I find that it really does relieve stress on my back and even on my shoulder.  Although I wasn't sure if I would like the distressed nylon, it's very attractive, looks a little like canvas, and has a nice feel to it.  Even though this bag is Extra Small, it has plenty of room for what I usually keep in a handbag.  The Healthy Back Bag comes in a series of larger sizes and different fabrics.  I've seen some of them and they're all extremely well made, as is this one.  I highly recommend this bag.",clothing

259,259,1569,"Thrilled was NOT the look I got when I ""surprised"" my husband with these for Christmas.  These were to replace the really nice leather/sheepskin slippers that he totally destroyed in only a few months. I figured that the SmartWool socks that I also got him for Christmas would convince him that these Birki's were the way to go....after some encouragement, he started wearing them more often, not just as slippers.  Now almost a year later, he wears them to work, outside to do yardwork, in our grungy basement, and just about everywhere else!  He especially likes the fact that when they get really dirty all  you have to do is take out the footbeds and drop shoes and inserts into a hot bucket of bleach water. Let the shoes soak and/or scrub them; the uppers wipe dry with a towel and I throw the cork footbeds in the dryer for a few minutes.  The Birki's are a little big large, most of that is width though.  If you wear a 1/2 size, unless your toes are really long (and be honest!) order a half size smaller because your heel should be cupped at the back of the clog.  There should not be a large space between your heel and the back of the clog - nor should the clog be so loose as to allow your foot to slide around or your toes to be jammed in the front.  I got blue because the supplier was out of black, but that turned out to be a good thing - I can tell the difference between my black pair and my husband's blue pair in the dark.  The blue is a nice darker denim blue - not a girly blue.  And for the record, these ARE the shoes to use if you work in a commercial kitchen!",clothing

340,340,3995,"I purchased these shoes back in mid-December for about $50 dollars all told. About two weeks in, after only having worn them a few times, the loop on the tongue that the laces are thread through unattached on one side. I didn't think much of it as it's not crucial to the shoes overall wearability. Now, about two and a half months in of what I'd consider to be normal wear, both of the soles have detached from the shoe on the outer front side. Having owned more than a dozen pairs of converse over the years, I can say this is not the quality I expect from this brand. I'm extremely dissatisfied and will NOT be re-purchasing from this retailer.",clothing
341,341,849,"This thing is huge. I wish it was adjustable. Definitely aimed at adults and not children as far as sizing goes. That said, it's nothing a head scarf can't fix if you don't plan to take it off. I hadn't planned to take it off, but being in it at home made me realize that wasn't going to be an option. It gets hot in there. I probably should have poked more discreet holes throughout the head so I had better airflow. Otherwise this served its purpose and I'll wear it again. At the SW premiere, Halloween parties, costume parties, raves, and maybe just for an autumn stroll down the street. Who knows? ***As far as the picture goes this mask is the one on the LEFT.

I can wear this for the remainder of my pregnancy, and afterwards. I might even have to go down to a small after I drop some of the pregnancy stomach, we'll see.

The number one thing you want to know when you're nursing is 'can I get my boobs out quickly'?? And this is such a cool dress and it's got the easy access.

I ordered an XL because I usually wear XL shirts and it's comfy for me and fits perfectly. The pictures aren't the most flattering that I'm posting with this, but I will be wearing this to parties and weddings even because I can get my daughter fed right away when she needs it, and it's a way to be dressy without feeling uncomfortable. I love that I can tie it either in the front or the back, if I tie in the front it hangs down the front and if you tie it in the back it's got a much shorter hanging part. Either way, I think it's really pretty.

The dress itself is soft and the color is beautiful (the lighting in my basement is fluorescent so it's not what you would call great for pictures) but it's actually a really deep purple that looks great with my skin tone. I am hoping to be pregnant soon and I know this will be a perfect way to keep myself comfortable when we may feel our most uncomfortable ever. *I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",clothing

The high-tops can take a little more work to get onto your feet, but it's worth it I think for the high-top style. And the pink is a nice subdued shade, not a gaudy hot pink or anything like that.

Brice Henderson wanted nothing but success for his company! He gave up everything and lets no one get in his way.

Lena Razzi has spent years trying to get over Brice and forget the pain he caused when he suddenly broke her heart. Once again she has found herself in his world and is at risk for another broken heart, especially when he finds out the secret she has kept from him.

Loved this story. This is my first read by Jeannette Winters and I loved it. The story is strong, well written and one of those cant put it down until the end kind of books.

What a shock to realize that you, too, need to start wearing them because the body mass below the belt in your nether regions has moved above your waist in front. How embarrassing to have to ask your wife to find suspenders for you on Amazon. Smart wives in this situation keep their mouths shut, print out a few choices and smile. My searching paid off, and these suspenders are exactly what he needed. Very comfortable, adjustable, wide enough to stay in place. He ordered two colors and is more than satisfied. Needing suspenders is one of the delights of aging, although I imagine this product would work well for someone on the farm or in other work situations where belts do not provide enough support.

502,2,7304,"These are such an amazing series of books, I almost don't know where to start.  The tales are magical, the characters rich, and the stories so layered that any generation can enjoy them.  I remember reading them when I was very young - and being excited when the cartoon of ""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"" came on tv each winter.  15+ years later I took a college course on them and loved them even more!  Similar to Harry Potter, the tales are about 4 ""normal"" children who stumble into an alternate world filled with ... well, lions and witches.  To this day, the name Aslan brings a smile to my face!  My only recommendation is to read them in the order they were written - which is (oddly) NOT chronological order to the timeline of Narnia itself, and not the order provided in this collection.  I don't suppose it makes all that much difference, and it certainly doesn't make the stories less enjoyable, nor cause me to lower my rating.

523,23,2338,"Dr. Seuss takes one of the most historic eras of the twentieth century and transforms it into one of life's lessons that may appeal to young and old.  The Butter Battle Book was first published in 1984 during the latter part of the Cold War of the mid 1980s.  The story involves two communities, the Yooks and the Zooks, and what can they possibly be in conflict with?  The right and wrong of spreading butter on a piece of bread, the Yooks argue that butter should be spread on top of the bread while the Zooks believe it should be spread on the bottom side of the bread.  What arises after each cannot come to a consensus?

The entire premise of the story involves building new inventive concoctions to deter the opposing group.  As all of this is going on within each side, the Yooks and the Zooks simply cannot see an end to the conflict.  Instead, they continue to build and build bigger walls and massive machinery with the attempt that one will give up.  However, neither side gives in.  And as one reads the story, one of the resolutions that neither side even attempted, a peaceful means of negotiation through communication and speaking with each side rather than producing more unnecessary inventions that simply have not worked.  So where does the story end?  Where it began.

The Butter Battle Book is one of Dr. Seuss's classic stories that falls within the same vein as other controversial storylines that speaks to the masses and offers a lesson, The Lorax.  This story also leaves much room for further discussion almost twenty years after it was written as well as within the present day.",books
524,24,2914,"This is a novel about the Spanish Civi War, specifically the story of an American who works with a group of partisans to sabotage a bridge.  The story takes place over three days but the book runs in excess of four hundred pages.  As a result, the pace can get slow at times.  No background is given on the war, but Hemingway's sympathies are clear: the fascists must be defeated, and the worth of personal sacrifices is determined in how they further the greater good.  Hemingway develops some interesting characters, particularly ""Pablo,"" a disillusioned partisan leader whose murderous actions in support of a noble cause lead him to alcoholism and defeatism.  The American protagonist is most interesting: a cynic who still believes in a cause outside himself.  The romantic relationship between the American and a Spanish girl was not the novel's strength; Hemingway did not make his career drafting love stories.  Although a bit slow, some of the scenes are fantastic.  In particular, the flashback to the murder of fascist sympathizers in a small village is one of the most horrifying chapters I have ever read.  Likewise, an account of a partisan group's last stand on a hilltop puts most Hollywood action movies to shame.  Liked the book but did not love it.  Probably for people who really dig Hemingway or want a bottom-up look at the Spanish conflict.",books

526,26,6863,"The fifth book in the series finds Lucy, Edmund, and Eustace joining Prince caspian on a ship called The Dawn Treader, which is setting sail to little known Narnian territories where Caspians uncles have been exiled. Each island explores a different sin by which an uncle fell, and a different magical encounter for the voyagers to face and resolve.

The developement of the mighty mouse Reepicheep is an especially welcome treat for children, and the scene in which Eustace becomes a dragon and embodies his own foul heart, so gaining a sort of enlightenment and a definite change of character, is a particularly skillful use of symbolism.

The reaching of Aslan's kingdom is also a symbol of enlightenment, with the Kingdom of Aslan invoking the Kingdom of Heaven in the reader's mind. The islands can be seen as steps in the path to heaven, and the character developement along the way can be seen as an outline to the steps towards righteousness and spirituality. As a fantasy or as a religious writing, this is a hugely important book!

527,27,3930,"The true test of an author is the ability to portray the mind of someone else.  Recently, that ability has been stretched by writers who describe the ""abnormal"".  The young, autistic Christopher in ""Curious Incident"" is the prime example.  Frances Itani takes us into a different world, that of the deaf.  It's a world of endless confusion.  There are sounds, so easy to the hearing, but meaningless to the deaf.  We think speech is the only important sound, but talk is hurried, undirected, and indistinct.  Nature produces her own sounds which we use in speech, but for which there's no meaning to the deaf.  Through Grania O'Brien's early life, Itani strives to introduce us to that world.  Does she succeed?

Grania, who would have been ""Grainne"" in her ancestral Ireland, lives in small-town Ontario as the story opens.  Deafened by scarlet fever [remember that?], she's coached by Mamo, her grandmother.  Blessed with a quick eye for lip-reading, Grania is given a book with words displayed as rope.  The rope, of course, becomes highly symbolic as the book progresses, but Grania begins to equate the shapes with meaning.  Mamo strains to have the girl equate printed words with proper sounds.  It's important that Grania ""blend in"" with the rest of the community.  With her parents running a hotel, Grania's only other tie is with her sister Tress, with whom she develops a secret sign language.

All of Mamo's dedicated effort, nor trips to sacred shrines, can't force the pace.  Grania is to leave home for a ""Deaf School"".  Itani portrays the school as staffed with immensely caring ladies.  No Dickens intrudes with harsh discipline or abuse, but the school draws children from across the Province.  All the children remain in school until the summer holidays.  Sign language is discouraged for those who can speak - dividing the children, some of whom are mute.  Itani passes rapidly over Grania's progress in the school.  The deaf girl, however, manages to shed some of her fear of the dark - a long-held terror.

Meeting a young aide in a hospital after leaving the school, Grania's life takes a new turn.  The courtship is but a moment in the story - the wedding description not even related until much later in the book.  Instead, the Kaiser rudely intrudes on their lives with the invasion of Belgium.  Itani carefully rejects any political discussion in the narrative.  King and Country [Britain, not Canada] are under threat and Jim must sign up.  There's no family discussion, no question of how Irish immigrants in a far land should react - Jim crosses the Atlantic.  There's a training stint, then Jim finds himself in the thick of battle.  When time and circumstances permit, letters are scribbled in muddy trenches.  Sometimes Grania's reach Jim, but delays in the exchanges make communication a flimsy thread.

Itani makes a splendid effort to depict the impact of the Great War.  Confronted as we are today by daily images of conflict, Itani still manages to impart a special sense of horror at events.  The years pass with Jim, a stretcher-bearer, braving the bombardments and fusillades of machine-gun fire, without being able to fight back.  He carries wounded, tends their injuries, dodges fire and grows increasingly introspective.  Never once, does he question the worth of the conflict.  At home in Desoronto, Grania watches the causality lists, the statistics of insanity, lengthen while she worries.  Soldier's wives need more visibility and Itani's effort is commendable.

This book cries out for a sequel.  Grania's life hardly ends with the Armistice.  With the end of the War, her deafness remains, the family is almost intact and a future must unroll.  Itani has built a unique scenario with skillful prose.  You will not find it easy to put this book down as you read.  However, when you do finish, you will find the conclusion abrupt.  Nothing is lost by that finale, but there might be much gained by going on.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]",books

536,36,190,"Among the various detective novelists writing today, Tony Hillerman occupies a pretty unique position. His series of detective novels, following first the adventures of two different characters, Lt. Joe Leaphorn and Sgt. Jim Chee, in separate books. Later, Hillerman combined the two characters, and has been chronicling their combined adventures for a good long time now. He's added supporting characters, including a series of girlfriends for Chee, a wife who died and then a lady friend for Leaphorn, and colleagues like the inimitable Cowboy Dashee, who's appeared in the background of several of the books.

This latest entry in the series isn't the strongest, but it is interesting. Someone's been killed on the Reservation, and before anyone can investigate, the FBI shows up and closes down the investigation, announcing the improbably verdict of ""hunting accident"". Chee doesn't buy the explanation, and both he and Leaphorn take to investigating on their own. Meanwhile, a former colleague of theirs, Bernadette Manuelito, has gone to work for the Border Patrol. While there, she discovers things which seem to link into the investigation on the Reservation that Chee and Leaphorn are running.

538,38,6843,"Of all the Narnian Chronicles, the Magician's Nephew addresses some of the most immediate problems of the modern world, and should be discussed with children. I believe that Lewis creates this forum for discussion uniquely in this work by having the action taking place within several different worlds (Charn, the Wood Between the Worlds, and our earth) in addition to Narnia. Lewis calls us to think about the possible fate of our world through the destruction of Charn and the creation of Narnia.

He does this by presenting the motivations and rationale for how Charn was destroyed. The answer comes through the two villains in the story: the evil Queen Jadis and Uncle Andrew. Both of them adhere to and promote a philosophy of superiority which echoes of a twisted version of Nietzsche's Superman. They believe that extraordinary people need to be above conventional rules of right and wrong in order to fulfill their ambitions for personal power and self-actualization. For Uncle Andrew this thinking allows him to use people without remorse, while for Queen Jadis, her disregard for any life, save her own, allows her to obliterate Charn. Digory's (as well as my own elementary students) were quick to understand the falsity of such erroneous thinking, and acknowledge and affirming the importance of following moral laws.  They realize the unjust results that such thinking creates amongst individual relationships (which they experience daily in school) and also how it would be destructive when nations begin to think this way.

This is further expressed and made applicable to readers when Lewis, near the end of the story, has Aslan give a warning to the Digory and Polly regarding the Deplorable Word for their time. The children leave Narnia and are sent back home with the warning that the fate which befell Charn could very well happen to their world if humanity is not careful. The reader by comparing the chronology of the Chronicles of Narnia will realize that the setting of the story is perhaps a couple of decades before the turn of the 20th century, and takes place decades before the Great War and World War II. Lewis, completing the Magician's Nephew near 1955 during the ensuing Cold War, looks back on history and comments about those world leaders who unleashed killing machines designed for conquest and genocide, and the devastation that came with the dropping of the Atomic Bomb at the end of WWII. The warning is a true one, and one that should be taught to children. Although one may consider such topics as too weighty for children, it is wrong to avoid them as well.  I am surprised how the children I teach today almost have never heard of the horrors of that era and of those that perpetrated crimes against humanity. Lewis making reference to these tragic historical events and raising issues of beliefs of might makes right, the difficulty of making moral choices, and the abuse of power in the Magician's Nephew probably would agree that such topics are not too beyond the age of the children.",books

546,46,9545,"I finished this while having my breakfast one morning, and it only took me 20 minutes. There's 240 pages, but each page has a note on it. Which can sometimes only be a line or two, occasionally, a paragraph.

The story's about a mother and daughter, who never see each other, they're like ships in the night, they pass each other. The mother's a busy doctor, the daughter's busy at school and her social life.

The mother discovers she has breast cancer, and suddenly, the relationship between the two changes. It's painstakingly honest, but too brief. You're made to feel like the daughter's selfish and doesn't care. Which didn't feel quite right.

The note style of the book is quite original, much like Cecelia Aherne's Where Rainbows End, but it does feel you leaving empty afterwards. And by the time you get to the last page, and keep turning, and there's no more, it's even worse. I did actually start crying, which wasn't pleasant (soggy cornflakes lovely), but at least I hadn't my face on for work yet. It was twice in twelve hours I'd cried, so don't read this book if you're already feeling emotional. I'm definitely going to pass this book onto my mum to read, and then onto a couple of my friends, as it's an excellent read, just too short.",books
547,47,6476,"Don't get me wrong. I liked this book. I really did. But compared to the others I just found it kind of lackluster and a little unfocused. The book is called Prince Caspian but the emphasis didn't seem to be on him; it was on the children and how they saved the day. I was expecting something a long the lines of the life and times of Prince Caspian, or something like that. The history that we do get of him is passively told for a couple of chapters (which was interesting nonetheless) and everything else was about the re-emergence of Old Narnia.

Prince Caspian was definitely more of a secondary character than the focus of the book. It almost seemed that he was just fodder for another adventure for the children which was kind of irritating. I was sad at the end, however, when we're told that Peter and Susan were getting too old to travel back and forth between the real world and Narnia. Very Peter Pan moment right there.

Overall I guess I wasn't as impressed with this one as I was with the others. It is a little disheartening to go into something thinking you're getting one thing and get something else. Like I said, it wasn't bad by any means. It's still a fantastic story but I think the power of a title comes into play here. If the title of the book is Prince Caspian, I expect him to be the main focus of the story, not a secondary plot line.",books

553,53,6648,"It is a year now since the two brothers and two sisters returned to England from their second adventurous trip to the magical kingdom of Narnia. However, three years have gone by in Narnia. Caspian has secured his throne over Narnia and has decided to search for the seven nobles that his evil uncle had banished when he seized the throne of Narnia from Caspian's father.
Edmund and Lucy are visiting their uncle and aunt when their rather obnoxious ever-complaining cousin enters their room. The three are looking at a picture of a ship and are suddenly magically transported to Narnia.
They land in the water on the side of King Caspian's ship The Dawn Treader and are rescued and taken on board. Caspian tells the three about his quest, and the siblings, but not Eustace, look forward to participating. Eustace is an amusing addition to the story. His foolish antics, reactions, remarks and behaviors adds humor to the tale, such as his misguided battles with the brave mouse Pug and his attempt to steal water when it was rationed.
Edmund, Lucy, Caspian, Eustace and Pug visit an island in the middle of their journey and are captured by slave traders. Caspian is rescued by one of the seven men that he is seeking. The slave traders have a huge army and Caspian hasn't enough people to beat them. He uses a clever deceit to rescue his friends.
The group set off again in search of the remaining six nobles. They experience a terrible storm and a sea serpent. After three weeks of danger, they arrive at an island. Eustace sneaks off by himself, gets lost, finds a treasure, turns into a flying dragon, and the noble lion Aslan arrives and turns him back into his human shape.
Readers will be intrigued with what follows. Did Caspian find the remaining six nobles? What had happened to them? Did the group reach the Far East? Is the Far East the land of Aslan? Did Eustace learn to behave properly? Did the brother and sister who were not in the beginning of the journey come to Narnia? Did the children get back to England; and, if so, how?",books

560,60,8486,"... ultimately a disappointment. When I started reading it, I couldn't put it down for an hour or so. I empathized with the narrator, and couldn't wait to see where the plot was going, and for Crichton's grand ideas. (Albeit sometimes strangely uninformed ideas - or perhaps, more likely, plot-useful fictions, e.g. the charming but scientifically hollow notion that apes can acquire language a la ""Congo"" (see ""The Creation Hypothesis"" for a succinct, devastating analysis of ape language research); dinosaurs ""evolving"" useful survival traits; etc.) No matter how shaky the science behind them - and some of the science has been very shaky - his ideas are always interesting; ""Timeline"" was chockful of fascinating ruminations, and I expected no less here.
Suddenly it was over.
The story is short and very localized, centering on half a dozen throwaway characters. The threat starts out as seeingly insurmountable, then becomes somewhat silly in its progress. I was reminded of ""Mount Dragon,"" but seemingly shorter, hurried, and smaller - a ""Mount Dragon"" Lite. Before you know it, it's over, and you're looking at the cover binding to see if some 100-odd pages have been removed.
Some technical terminology (the obligatory ""fractals"", for one) is tossed in, but doesn't really go anywhere useful. There are a couple of huge plot holes which allow the threat into the wild. The scenario supposes a level of nano-engineering that is quite fantastical, but which, like ""Congo's"" talking gorilla, would be forgiveable if the story were more meaty.

561,61,7949,"Michael Crichton is one of the best popular writers today. I don't think that's debatable. That fact makes Prey all the more disappointing. In it, Crichton relies too heavily on his page-turning style of writing (similar to Harlan Coben) and abandons what made him a must-read - a plot people believe. Maybe he's a victim of his success. Regardless, the characters here are shallow and undeveloped and the ""horrifying"" nanobots are really more of a joke than a threat. Anyone could predict the end if they're paying attention in the first couple of chapters. Unfortunately, you have to read 350 or so pages to confirm that assumption.",books

563,63,462,"My 3 year old just loves this book: illustrations, narrative and overall message. It's a 'must read' for bedtime since he got it.",books
564,64,8503,"First off, I'm a die-hard Michael Crichton fan...absolutely LOVE his stuff...however -- 'Prey' is definitely a 'formula' novel...most notably a Crichton formula novel which borrow extensively from previous works like 'Jurassic Park' & 'Timeline'.  If you have read many of his other novels, this formula will become immediately apparent: Big corporation is messing with technology they don't fully understand nor appreciate, and in the process unleash something baaaad.  First it was the Dinosaurs when InGen toyed around with genetic manipulation where they shouldn't have...next we have a very similar company in 'Timeline' that wanted to send the elite on once-in-a-lifetime trips through time, using science again that was a bit beyond our control and now we have nanotechnology in 'Prey' that provides a frightening look at what *could* happen should this kind of near-future science fall into the hands of those who attempt to use it for all the wrong reasons.
Just because Crichton is using his 'formula' here, that doesn't mean he doesn't provide us with some great cliff-hangers and genuine surprises along the way...his writing talent is far too refined to have forgotten how to pull a few strings with the readers.  'Prey' begins with poor Jack, a reluctant house-husband with a wife who has quickly become one of the powerhouse leaders at Xymos (you guessed it, the 'big corporation' that funds experiments that go horribly wrong).  Her sudden and suspiciously odd actions make Jack begin to suspect that she (Julia) just might be having an affair.  He pushes this thought away every time more and more evidence begins to mount that this is no longer a theory and more likely a fact.  Her behavior seems erratic (at best), distant with him and the children and she tells small (but significant) lies which unravel the fabric of their relationship.  All this is shockingly interrupted when Julia is involved in an accident which sends her to the hospital.  Meanwhile an incredibly un-expected invitation by his former boss (who fired him under trumped up charges) is offered to Jack asking him to come back (sort of) to help Xymos figure out how to solve a problem with a program that Jack's technical team had designed some time before.  At first Jack is totally against going back under ANY circumstances...but as the problem with Julia becomes more of an immediate concern, he figures that maybe he could find out more about her supposed affair by accepting the offer.
This is where the rubber hits the pavement, so-to-speak.  This is where Jack becomes immersed in the world of nanoswarms, produced by Xymos for the Military to spy on the enemy.  As in all of Crichton's novels, nothing is as it seems, and the people who give the tours of the production facility know a lot more than they are letting on (always to the suspicion of those on the receiving end of the tour).  Jack has reason to believe Ricky (the tour-guide) is holding back crucial information on the little problem they have come up against.  It appears that the company has made a once-in-a-lifetime scientific breakthrough which has allowed them to begin full production of machines on the molecular level.  Millions of microscopic machines were accidentally vented to the Nevada environment and have a peculiar problem:  they won't come back...they seem to be multiplying on their own (which they just shouldn't be able to do)...they seem to be killing desert animals...oh, and they were programmed using a predator/prey program that Jack and his former team-mates created.  Just about everything that Ricky says turns out to be half-truths or outright lies from pretty much the beginning.  Jack almost immediately has a plan that nobody had previously thought about which will eliminate the nanoswarms...but if you know the typical Michael Crichton novel, you know that first, and even second plans usually go horribly wrong.  What exactly is Ricky hiding from Jack and just about everyone else?  How are the nanoswarms able to multiply?  How are they developing behavior that their programming says should be 100% impossible?  How is Jack's wife, Julia embroiled in all of this, and is she really having an affair?  And the biggest question of all: Can the nanoswarms be stopped...and if so, how?
Good questions and for the sheer fun of the story I gave 'Prey' 5 stars, but for re-telling a story told before in 'Jurassic Park' and 'Timeline' I give it just 4 stars.  Perfectly enjoyable even despite my reservations and I very much look forward to the future movie at the local cineplex, it ought to be a real nail-biter.",books

Now the story does come back to me, and oddly perhaps, I find it a just bit disturbing. I guess it is just me. I was an extremely shy child, loyal to just a couple close friends but never liking groups or meeting new people. I still do not like being in a group very much, or going to bars or parties. From my point of view, here is this aggressive, back-slapping, hand-shaking, smooth-talking stranger cat, you let him into your life as a friend, next thing you know things are spiralling out of control as more and more strangers are forced upon you, each more removed from your standards of morality and responsible behavior than the last. How you have ultimately disgraced your family name... yet it is hard to say at what exact instant should you have put your foot down, without appearing rude and unreasonable. I can dimly recall being frightened a bit by this book as a child, and I wonder now if it reinforced my natural tendency towards introversion and reclusiveness.

Then there was the time I captured a ""daddy-long-legs"" spider in kindergarten and the teacher gave me a jar to keep it in, but all the other kids wanted to ""look"" at it but actually poked it with pencils so by the time I stepped off the school bus at home my spider was just a squished blob with weakly twitching legs. It was my duty to protect that spider, but I failed miserably to counter the assertive and cruel attitudes of my classmates.

577,77,8508,"Crichton is finally back in his prime, covering what he does best: fact- and science-based fiction. This time around, he's got the good sense to not let the book degenerate into a direct-to-video scripted action sequence halfway through the book (read Timeline if that's what you're looking for). Having read all of Crichton's books (including Travels), I can say that Prey is one of the better ones, combining the how-cool-is-that aspect of technology (Jurassic Park) with the confusion and paranoia of being attacked by a force that's not well understood (Sphere). What puts the icing on the cake is that Crichton has again written a great character that's fleshed out a lot more than his usual protagonists. Long-time readers might even be distraught at the amount of character development that exist within Prey. All in all, a satisfying read, although not the most intellectually challenging.",books

And just when you think hes hit rock bottom (i.e.: Timeline, Airframe, etc), along comes Prey. Prey is so awful I cant even describe its awful awfulness to you. Im just hoping my repeated use of the word awful will convey how awful this novel truly is. After finishing Prey, I decided I would never waste money on a Crichton novel again. Quite possibly one of the worst books I have ever read. I only wish that there were a 0 star rating available.",books

Prey has all the staples of Crichton's best work.  A good setting, great scientific background, and a quick pace.  Of course it also suffers the other typical problems with Crichton novels...weak characters, and the familiar prose of problem-hypothesis-scientific explanation-new problem (and repeat).

The story focuses on nanotechnology (microscopic robots) and how they are let loose from a laboratory into the environment.  Naturally they begin to ""prey"" on anything they view as a threat and it's up to our computer-programming hero to come in and save the day.

The book reads like it could someday be a big screen movie.  Overall I had fun with this book, not as good as Jurassic Park but better than Congo.",books
580,80,8102,"I am a huge Michael Crichton fan, especially of his books.  They are much better stories than their movie counterparts (Jurassic Park is a perfect example of that).  However, his last few books have purely been written for the screen.  ""Prey"", sadly, is no exception.
This story is about nanotechnology and how the creators get overrun by the monsters they create.  Like in most of Crichton's other books, it's very fast-paced supported by science that is somewhat controversial.  It begins very quickly and has few slow sections, especially if you are interested in nanotechnology.  However, it eventually slows down and ends anti-climactically.  The characters were flat and could not keep the story going once it reached its end.
Sadly, Crichton has written another book designed to become a movie screenplay.  If you read it as such, you may find it interesting.  It is fairly fast-paced and can be read in a few days.  However, if you're looking for a story to stand on its own merits without the underlying pretense of ""this is going to become a movie"", then you'll be disappointed.",books

While this book at first appears to be a young man's ""coming of age"" story, the young woman who is his supporting character is strong, funny, and independent -- an excellent foil who easily stands on her own.

Even though AIRBORN is obviously an ""alternate history"" fantasy, the characters could easily be real people.  An excellent read, especially for adults who need a break from real life for just a bit. ;-D

582,82,2355,"There's a reason this book's popularity pales in comparison with the gazillion other wonderful books Dr. Seuss created.  I believe Dr. Seuss was a genius, and my political leanings are in line with his.  The only explanation I can come up with for this book is that it wasn't intended for children or non-violent adults, but rather to send to war mongers to show them the error of their ways.  My five and seven year old daughters found it downright disturbing.  I ""accidentally"" skipped over much of it when I saw the look of sadness, concern, and utter confusion on their faces.  It details a war between two nations, and the somewhat silly names for the weaponry are not nearly enough to make the increasingly morbid arms race palatable.

There are just so many better Dr. Seuss books: for big kids and adults, try ""Did I Ever Tell You How Lucky You Are"", ""Oh, the Places You Will Go"", or ""Happy Birthday to You""; for little kids, read ""One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish"", ""Go Dog, Go!"", and ""Dr. Seuss's ABC"".  These are a much better representation of this man's talent, and just a tiny taste of the incredible treasures he left for the world to enjoy.

P.S. ANYTHING adapted by Tish Rabe for Dr. Seuss is excellent as well, and great for intelligent elementary-aged kids.",books
583,83,8512,"Crichton does things differently here...He writes the entire story in first-person; he starts off with family life; he merely hints at the trouble to come. Having read almost all his fiction works, I found this story as engaging as ever.
We start off with Jack and Julia, a modern couple facing problems of family life. Jack is at home with the kids, while Julia deals with mounting work pressures and the possibilities for infidelity. Although both Jack and Julia have experience in groundbreaking technology, their story begins in a setting familiar to all, thus adding weight to the coming suspense.
Don't be mistaken, though; the suspense will come, and the usual technological ideas will reign. A highly-evolved swarm of nanoparticles has escaped from a secretive lab, and they are responding to predator-prey programming that Jack helped develop and Julia helped perfect. Along the way, Jack will be called in to help coordinate the counterattack against the swarm--if he and his team don't first become the prey.
This book starts off with more heart than usual for a Crichton book. I was fully involved by the time the true troubles came. The applications to society and technology are worthwhile to consider, and Crichton pulls out a few surprises by the end.
What he fails to do--to my chagrin--is sustain the sense of family and familiarity with which he starts the story. The concern we have for his kids soon falls away into a plot contrivance, and we find ourselves squarely in the middle of a regular Crichton story. A fun and fast-paced story it is, but it could've been even better if he continued with the human angle. Eventually, when the worst of the death toll hits, we find ourselves caring only on a superficial level. In fact, even Jack shows little emotional response.
Was I breathless at the climax? Yes. Did I actually care? Nah, not much. After all was said and done, it was a one-night stand of a book.  I felt like rolling over, lighting a cigarette, and trying not to consider the horrible consequences of Crichton's technology run-amok.",books

Almost as much a horror tale as a science fiction piece, Prey has a coherent narrative and a chilling sense of dread about it that makes it a better read than Crichton's Next (somewhat scattered and over the top) or Timeline (not relevant enough to the average reader to be that scary).  In some ways it harkens back to and updates mood and the plot of Andromeda Strain.  The topic, nano-particles and swarm intelligence, has a futurist cachet, but still relates well to the average reader's experience and fears and, of course, makes Prey a less controversial read than Crichton's State of Fear (dealing with global warming).  While not quite at the level of Jurassic Park, Prey is a page-flipping techno-thriller which both frightens and educates.  Donald J. Bingle, Author of Forced Conversion.",books

596,96,6565,"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (1952) is a children's fantasy novel, the third in C. S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia. Here, Edmund and Lucy, along with their insufferable cousin Eustace, are pulled into Narnia to aid Caspian in his search for seven missing Narnian lords.

There isn't much of an overarching plot here as there are in Lewis's prior novels; it's much more episodic, as the Dawn Treader sails to one island after another, and to one adventure after another. And this is why the novel works so well: Lewis has given himself complete narrative freedom to do whatever he wants, and he uses the full measure of his wondrous imagination. The unexpected is here in a way unlike the previous stories, and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader has throughout it the full and free spirit of fantasy adventure.

The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is a more charming read than either of Lewis's previous books in the series, and the primary reason is that Lewis, as narrator, has gotten himself rather more playfully involved, making humorous observations here and witty comments there, in a way reminiscent of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit. Lewis's characters' dialogue is also sharp and clever, certainly more so than in previous books. My general impression is that with this book, Lewis really got a handle on his Narnian storytelling.

As is usual for him, Lewis has a number of moral themes at work here: most obviously, he addresses greed on a number of occasions - greed for wealth, for status, and for beauty. Through Eustace, Lewis extols the virtues of being well-mannered and considerate of others, but he also attacks the notion that ""modern values"" are inherently superior.

Christian themes are not as prominent here as in some other works (except, of course, Christian virtue), but they can be found in some depth in Reepicheep's quest for Aslan's Country - his quest, as it were, for afterlife and the Kingdom of God. And this is an area of the story where Lewis excels. He does a fine job of balancing childish wonderment and mature gravity in his characters as they approach the end of the world, and Lewis's fleeting glimpses of what might lie beyond fire the spirit and the imagination.

The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is an outstanding adventure novel; it might be my favorite book in the series.",books

598,98,8121,"The decline of respect for science and nature studies in the United States owes much to Michael Crichton.  In books such as Andromeda Strain and Jurrasic Park, he portrays Nature as a capricious force, needing only a thoughtless step or touch of greed to launch a cascade of uncontrollable events.  This book takes the theme a large step forward by using nanotechnolgy to present yet another threat to humanity.
Jack Forman, unemployed programmer, is a forty-year-old househusband to a wife successful in a new high-tech company.  Xymos, inevitably under military contract, is developing a reconnaissance technology using networking nanobots.  They've been programmed with predator algorithms to focus on ""goals"" to achieve their purpose.  Also inevitably, they elude control, escaping into the Nevada desert.  Their predation skills net them coyotes, rabbits and rattlesnakes - and certain microchips.  In the final inevitability, their ultimate prey is humans.  Jack, who understands their programming best, is called in as a consultant to show the rest of the research team how to restore control.
From this point Crichton's narrative unfolds like a film script [which, of course, is the intent].  There are deaths, the nanobots, following a contrived Darwinian ideal, evolve well beyond the intent of their original instructions.  They develop new skills at a stupendous rate, each step forward presenting a greater threat to Jack and his colleagues.  Jack's wife, Julia, arrives at the Nevada site, ostensibly in support.  Changes in her recent behaviour suggest, inevitably, she's having an affair with one of the team.  What appears to be illicit romance, however, proves something more sinister.  Inevitably, Jack is almost alone in his role as combative consultant.
Crichton is always as up-to-date with technology as the literature allows.  His extensive bibliography demonstrates his research to anyone's satisfaction.  That he can take it a step further only demonstrates his imaginative skills.  In line with many of his recent books, his  research has left him with little energy for a developed plot.  His characters are thin and events predictable.  It's a ""page turner"" to find out What Happens Next, but there's little doubt over the ultimate outcome.  Yet, as with most of his works, the conclusion is vague.  The reader is intentionally left unsatisfied.  This is as much a contribution to the vague disquiet over science and nature among his readers as the topic of the story.  While this might be viewed as a call for more and better research, Crichton makes it clear that he considers all science suspect.  That's an unfortunate attitude.

600,100,7577,"Prey is a techno-thriller written over a decade ago, so my main worry was how dated it was going to be. The author did a smart thing, though. He never directly referred to a lot of technology, at least not any that I would understand, so I did not find it dated at all. It is always a shame when you are reading about something, and these use a term like ""floppy disc'"" or something. Luckily, Michael Crichton seems to have avoided this kind of failure. Thank goodness.

As for the nanoparticles, or as we now call them, nanobots, they were not the viscous killers I expected them to be . . . at first. They had to learn, adapt, and evolve, all of which takes time. Well, not much time as a new generation is born every day. So these little buggers get smarter with every cloud that they send at the scientists. Thank goodness this story takes places way out in the middle of nowhere, otherwise, if this would have been happening in a major metropolitan area, well, humans would all be toast by now and robots would rule the world! (Maniacal laughing should be heard right here.)

I liked all of the main characters in this story. Jack finds himself thrown into this mess and is forced to try to clean it up. His wife, Julia, is the one that helped invent the nanoparticles while working at Xymos Technology. The nanoparticles were never supposed to be free. They are supposed to be injected into the human body where they work at healing everything that is wrong. But when they do get free, no one is safe.

Michael Crichton has come up with an interesting concept in this swarm of nanoparticles. Sure, it is an older book and we have seen movies about this type of thing in the last thirteen years, but that doesn't mean that this book is not worth reading. The story moves along at a slow pace, building the tension as events unfold. I wasn't scared by this book at all, which is something I was hoping for. Maybe I have seen too many thrilling movies to have been scared by this book. I was hoping for a little more tension.

Overall,  Prey is a good story that could have benefitted from more tension. Sure, I was worried about the main characters, but not too worried. At one point, I was yelling at the Jack to remember something that happened at the beginning of the book. Finally, he does, and then, oh boy . . . So, if you like techno-thrillers and you haven't read  Prey yet, it might be a good time to pick up a copy. You won't be disappointed.

601,101,8288,"For two days, I could barely put this book down. This time Crichton's plot revolves around nano computers and an unemployed father of three, Jack, who believes his wife is having an affair. Jack's real problems begin the instant his infant daughter wakes up screaming in the night from a mysterious rash but in short order he's called upon to save the world from uncontrollable swarms of deadly nano computers. (Luckily Jack's an unemployed computer code writer, and it's his code on predator and prey behavior that the tiny computers are running on.)

Prey reminds me both of The Andromeda Strain and Jurassic Park, with a great balance of story and science. The concepts in Prey are quite realistic and terrifying and the suspense in the last half of the book is incredible. (Plus, Michael Crichton was years ahead of his time with the misuse of cloning theme used in Jurassic Park, so I think that adds an element of credibility to his ideas.)
I admit that there are a couple of too convenient contrivances, and the ultimate outcome is somewhat sudden and movie-ish (Without a doubt there will be a movie version) but Prey remains a great story. I enjoyed it immensely and can't wait for Crichton's next!",books

603,103,8339,"Michael Crichton's career started with high-tech novels that were thought-provoking and very suspenseful. Then he moved into the Jurassic Park field, where he terrorized us with a nature-runs-amock plot. But ever since he tangled with corporate law in Disclosure, Crichton's efforts have been less than stellar. Airframe was lame and boring, and Timeline was long-winded and not very exciting. But I'm happy to say that the real Crichton, the Jurrasic Park and Andromeda Strain Crichton is back. And boy is this a great welcome party!
Of course, he does not let go of his favorite theme; nature vs. mankind. In Prey, a family man named Jack (can you have a more average-joe name?) is thrown into a virtual nightmare when he is brought to the Nevada desert to help a research group with a problematic new technology.
This group, led by Jack's wife (who is now in the hospital after a serious car accident), has developped small camera-like atom particles that can run in minuscule places (like the human body for example) to take pictures. Only, they have come to realize that their strain has begun evolving on its own and that one of them has escape. And soon enough, they find themselves faced with something much more dangerous: a computerized plague that kills remorselessly everything that comes on its path.
Crichton is great at writing high-adrenalyn suspense scenes. Prey does not disappoints. The moment Jack steps foot in the desert, the tension starts building. And building. And building. The levels of suspense are so great at times that it's just impossible to put the book down. This is a littke like John Carpenter's The Thing, set in the desert with a lot of technological mumbo-jumbo talk. But fortunately, Crichton's technological writing is done in a way that almost everyone will be able to follow without getting lost in all the high-tech talk.
If you can get passed Crichton's simplistic writing (sometimes, much too simplisitc) and corny dialogue, what you'll find is a thrill ride that'll make you bite your nails to the bone. Prey isn't a great novel. It's fun, action-packed and highly entertaining. Everything you've come to expect from a good Crichton yarn, and more.",books

His protagonist goes on AT LENGTH describing the normal day hundreds of millions of mothers world wide endure as if it's something novel. His male character whines about taking care of kids, how his wife doesn't call home when she's late, how it's hard to run into former pals who still make a paycheck. Honestly, no female author could ever have gotten such tripe published, but because our protagonist is a male, this is fodder for narrative. My husband and I howled at the beginning, and simply skipped entire chapters to get to the part he's good at: telling a scary story using potentially real science.

614,114,7103,"In my new book, PASSPORT TO NARNIA: A NEWCOMER'S GUIDE, I try to put to rest the controversy about the order in which the books should be read, and for good reason: Lewis himself did not write these books as an interlocking whole, as did Tolkien (THE LORD OF THE RINGS) and J.K. Rowling (the Harry Potter novels). Lewis wrote that he wrote the books as they occurred to him, which is why he himself had no preference in which the books SHOULD be read. My contention is that the important thing is to READ these novels, not worry about the reading order. Besides, HarperCollins, his publisher, has made a decision to publish the books with  THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW first, followed by THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE because, as is stated on the copyright page of the one volume hardback & paperback editions, ""Although THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW was written several years after C.S. Lewis first began THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, he wanted it to be read as the first book in the series. HarperCollins is happy to present these books in the order in which Professor Lewis preferred.

Regarding the seven novels themselves and their readability: Great books come from great writers who can not only are outstanding storytellers but also offer more than mere diversion: Lewis, a celebrated scholar, teacher, writer, and popularizer of the Christian faith, was a literary giant; and when we read the Chronicles of Narnia, we see the world filtered through his worldview. The books and the writer are in this case inseparable; the books come from the writer and are deep expressions of his humanity, his views on courage and sacrifice and honor, which are at the heart of these seven novels. Having sold 85 million copies since 1950 (when the first book in the series was published), you can rest assured that the books have stood the test of time, entertaining and illuminating five generations of readers.

The only complaint I have about this boxed set is that the production values are mismatched: the covers are gorgeously printed, but the interiors use very cheap pulp paper, with blotty ink printing that obscures not only the text but the wonderful Pauline Baynes artwork. Since mass market paperbacks are routinely printed on pulp paper, the problem here seems to be the presswork: The over-inking of these pages obscures the printing of the text and obliterates the artwork. Since the one volume editions are issued from the same publisher, with readable text and no glaring deficiencies in the presswork, I hope that the publisher takes the time to correct what is otherwise a handsome, affordable, boxed edition.

A few comments about the forthcoming movie: the trailer looks wonderful and captures the sense of wonder that is Narnia. Early reviews are positive and, from all indications, Disney Pictures has a winner of a film and the beginnings of a major, new franchise. To my mind, the best thing about the movie is that it will prompt a certain number of people to go into the bookstores and look for the principal texts; I came to the Narnia books late in life, but reading them did what good fiction is supposed to do: Those books took me out of this world and into C.S. Lewis's wonderful and enchanting world of Narnia, and isn't THAT what superb storytelling is all about?

Bottom line: Despite my reservations about the printing of the interiors of these books, this is the edition of choice because of its price and portability. If you haven't read these books, now is the time to start: After December 9, when the film is released, everyone will be rushing to the bookstore to see what is next.

I look forward to the film release and also look forward to re-reading the Chronicles of Narnia again, just as soon as I finish re-reading Tolkien's THE LORD OF THE RINGS from cover to cover (including the appendices).",books

Clara is the wall-flower who stays in the hometown she grew up in and leads what she feels is a fairly conservative lifestyle. Her life is revealed to us in journal entries and letters to her sister Nora. A horrible event shakes up her life in ways she never knew possible and eventually leads her down roads she felt she would never trod upon.

Her sister Nora is leading the glamorous life and becomes very much a socialite in her circles. Her correspondence with her sister shows us that all is not how it appears in her life either.

In Hand in Glove an entire family seems to have never taken the time to get to know each other while disdaining to develop friends, interests or relationships other than those predetermined by biology. This in itself would be an interesting tale told by another sort of author--along the lines of William Trevor. However, when an entire book is based on a premise that the expiring royalties from two very slender volumes of poetry are enough to incite murder and kidnapping in this same clan--whose daily expenditures seem more in the realm of Rupert Murdoch/Richard Branson--the plot wheezes improbably along until at long last resorting to a rapid, highly improbable and sensational tabloid-style conclusion.

632,132,2991,"It is a fascinating tale of Robert (Roberto) Jordon and his paisonos, caught up in the Spanish Civil War. The story covers only three days of the war, yet it takes us on Robert Jordon's life voyage. It is conveyed by the brilliant soliloquy, a tug of war of conscience, duty, honor and death itself.  Who among us has not had such dialogue?

 It has everything, romance, camaraderie, bravery, cowardice, and above all sacrifice. Jordon, an American, who is addressed as ""Ingles"" by his comrades, is the band's leader, who is commissioned by the rebellion general to blow up a bridge.

His team includes some unforgettable characters ever penned, the ruthless yet pragmatic Pablo, his incredibly humane wife, Pilar, Augustine, brave soldier, like a brother to Robert, and lovely, innocent Maria. Roberto (Jordon) and Maria fall in love the moment they meet and once Pilar reads his palm, the denouement is never in doubt.

The scene where Pablo is in charge with a gun hustling out town's fascists who are holed up in the church,  to be ""taken care"" of  by the avenging mob outside  is reminiscent of ""krystalnacht"" enactment superbly portrayed by Gnter Grass in his classic Nazi drama"" Tin Drum"".

Gwendolyn herself is a witch, and though she's quite a good one, she gets angry quite easily -- a darkness brews inside her that she can't control, and her spells are powerfully dangerous.

Cat doesn't know how to stop his devious , stronger sister -- already she's gaining to much power, and goodness knows what she can do with her witchcraft !

640,140,6917,"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is a stand out among the books in Lewis' excellent series.  There are several elements in this book that distinguish it from the books that chronologically precede it.  Old characters are put away and new characters (some humans, no less) emerge in importance, there is an absence of a monolithic evil antagonist, and no part of this story actually occurs in ""Narnia.""  Lewis demonstrates a mastery for tension and suspense in this book that is not so apparent in the others, and when reading this one I noticed more moments when my kids' eyes were wide-open with anticipation (e.g., what will happen to Lucy at the end of that strange hallway, what are those threatening invisible thumpers, and will the Dawn Treader ever sail out of the nightmarish blackness?).  At bottom, this is a classic and well-done journey story, in which pilgrims put their lives in a fragile boat and sail into the unknown, first to rescue seven loyal heroes and, eventually, to find the Thing greater than them all (that's Jesus, for the honest reader).  Aslan makes his many usual appearances, with a strengthening of the concept that he is always present and always in control, no matter whether our human characters know it or take comfort in the knowledge.  I don't think it's a spoiler to say that the reader gets to see the Lion revealed as the Lamb in a candid moment.

646,146,7214,"I thought it timely, in light of the controversy surrounding another ""End Times"" story, to remark on this most remarkable of C.S. Lewis' Narnia Chronicles.  This satisfying series conclusion illustrates Lewis' brilliant analysis of Biblical prophesy in a touching story children of God can all look to with anticipation (""...Amen. Come, Lord Jesus."" Rev. 22:20b).
This is the story of Armaggedon; the conflict between anti-Christ (anti-Aslan) and the great masses of inhabitants of lost Narnia deceived by him and doomed for eternity versus the ultimate salvation of the few true followers of Aslan to eternal life in His Country, the True Narnia.  The allegory to Scriptural truth is remarkable as illustrated by this most insightful, genius mind of modern-day Christian apologists.
The high point of the story occurs after the destruction of the old world and the lost souls who rejected Aslan, who are dispatched allegorically in Revelations 20, ""lake of fire"" fashion.  The heroes of the story, including all the key players from the earlier Chronicles, are seen trying out their new ""resurrection"" bodies exploring the most beautiful place ever imagined, thrilled to have Aslan with them.  They find after a while that the beautiful country is actually Narnia, the REAL Narnia.  Though the Narnia they knew and loved was perceived most wonderful, it was a mere shadow of the perfect New Narnia, the one that would last forever, always with Him present and providing all the light in the never-ending Day.
For believers in Christ, Lewis has projected a clear picture mortal minds can comprehend of how it might be on that Day.  It is shown through a children's story because that is how we must come to Him; like a child.  ""You must become just like a child to enter the Kingdom of God"".  Jesus said ""let all the little children come to Me"".  In Narnia, those child-like believers were never lost once they found Him, by His grace.  Those who perished were the lovers of the old, decaying, temporary Narnia and were deceived by what their own wills commanded, rejecting and hating Aslan and worshipping the god of their chosing, their own selves.  This is a definitive picture of our fallen world and our fallen culture.  Lewis' work is prescient in describing the condition of the world of today, one in which Jesus could return to at any time, as our prayer pleads from Revelation cited above (but if He tarries, one and all can be sure that He is coming soon; ""soon"" defined as the lifespan of the individual).
One last point on a most poignant scene from the story.  It involves the fierce young Tarkaan warrior Emeth, devoted follower of the vulture-like god of the Calormens, Tash.  As our heroes are exploring the Real Narnia, following Aslan ""further in and further up"", they discover this unlikely believer sitting perplexed under a tree, ""surprised by joy"".  Emeth's story is one that demonstrates man's frequent inability to match his rational and correct thoughts with his often erroneous mental images of said correct thought.  In this case this child of the Light lived bravely demonstrating the fruits of the Spirit in humility, submission and obedience to the true God of everything, the Self-Existant Great I AM.  But his human error was in his vision of what God looked like and not knowing His correct name.  Emeth is somewhat like Helen Keller, who, when ""told"" about Jesus by Anne Sullivan in the eternal darkness, quiet and aloneness of her disability, said ""so that's His name; I know Him"".
The story of Emeth's salvation by grace is much akin to the salvation of the thief on the cross, or like mine.  It doesn't say that ""being good"" gets one into Heaven, as one mistaken reviewer opined.  It does show that a totally surrendered heart turned toward the One true living God in obedience and love will not be turned away, no matter how mistaken one's mental images may be about God. It is a beautiful picture of salvation by faith through His grace and not by works.  God does all the saving; the Holy Spirit teaches us about the true nature of God by His perfect, inerrant Word.  Lewis' picture of Emeth is one all believers should take heart in, realizing it is not our purview to know who God has saved by His sovereign will.  Of course, Emeth's works demonstrated his salvation, even though he was not recognized as a believer.
Emeth's conviction, humility and devotion in this passage continues to bring me to tears.  As Aslan seeks him out in the New Narnia, Emeth is convinced he is about to die.  He has seen Aslan in His Glorious Appearing and is convicted of his sins.  He falls at His feet thinking ""Surely this is the hour of death, for the Lion (who is worthy of all honor) will know that I have served Tash all my days and not him. Nevertheless, it is better to see the Lion and die than to be Tisroc of the world and live and not to have seen Him.""  Read the book to see a most beautiful prosaic illustration of Christ's mercy and grace.
This is an ideal book to read either before or after reading the last of the Left Behind series, Glorious Appearing.  The stories are very similar with the same outcome and the same great Hope.  The self-possessed ""intellectuals"" of the world may guffaw at those who believe in ""Whom"" Lewis and other Christians have assurance.  Most of these ""intellectuals"" are ignorant of Scripture, though some are over-studied yet deluded by their self-enlightenment, hard hearts or pride (see 2 Corinthians 4:4, 2 Thessalonians 2:10-12 for the bottom line, or if you can't get translation from that source, try reading Lewis' definitive study Miracles).
The Chronicles of Narnia are reading for a lifetime.  They should be read by believers as a reminder of how we are to come into His presence.  In Narnia we see the joys of serving Him in the trials and in the triumphs of this life.  In The Last Battle we see the Genius of Revelation as given to Lewis on a plain that even great intellects can embrace if they are willing to ""not harden their hearts"" (Hebrews 3:12-15).  If they are not willing they will get a clear picture of the consequences.",books

The parable is a little facile, and the dialog naive-- but the overall thrust benign and even helpful. It may well be a doorway to a better path for many who read it.

650,150,2872,"Controversy has swirled around Ernest Hemingway's masterpiece since the day it was published. ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in 1941 and the Pulitzer committee agreed unanimously to name the book as the winner of the fiction category. Board president Nicholas Murray Butler, however, overruled the committee on the grounds that he felt the book to be profane and offensive. No award in the fiction category was given that year. The Pulitzer committee, sans Butler, did go on to award Hemingway in 1953 for ""The Old Man and the Sea."" Butler has since been widely criticized for his partisan politics and racial beliefs during his 43 year stint as president of Columbia University. Hemingway also won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954.

""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" is Ernest Hemingway's seminal novel of the Spanish Civil War. Beginning in 1937 Hemingway traveled to Spain to cover the war as a reporter. In the years before WWII, Spanish Republicans, backing the established Spanish Republic fought the fascist Nationalist forces of General Francisco Franco. The Republicans received backing from the Soviet Union and various organizations of the Marxist movement, among others. The rising forces of Nazi Germany and Italy backed Franco. The fascists under Franco won. Franco established a dictatorship and then went on to rule Spain with an iron hand until his death in 1975.

It is easy to get hung up on all the politics involved in this book - who is backing which side, etc. Remember the time frame of the book (pre-WWII) and know that the story is essentially human. It is about ideals, loyalty, love, sacrifice, and honor in the face of loss and death. Robert Jordan is an American who joins the guerrillas fighting on the side of the republic as a dynamiter. Jordan's goal is to blow a key bridge right after a Republican attack starts against the Fascists. He meets up with the anti-Fascist cell in the area, which is headquartered in a well-hidden cave. Pilar is the wife of Pablo, who ostensibly is in charge, but Pilar runs the show. Pablo is tired, burned out, and dangerous to the cause after years of war and atrocities committed on both sides, and Pilar takes the reins. While coordinating the attack with the cell Robert Jordan meets and falls in love with Maria, a young woman adopted by the cell after her family is decimated by the fascists and she is raped by their soldiers. Much like the principal characters in ""A Farewell to Arms,"" the wartime romance is accelerated and Jordan undergoes a transformation due to his love for Maria. He begins to question his role in an increasingly futile conflict. He spiritually takes Maria for his wife with hopes and dreams for the future. When it becomes evident that the guerrilla attack will be doomed, Jordan must decide between escaping with Maria or staying true to his ideals and do his duty with honor in the face of impending disaster. The entire story takes place in four days.

I really liked ""For Whom the Bell Tolls."" It gets beyond the politics and the ideologies and more into the nature of war, showing that there is good and bad on both sides of any conflict. Hemingway points out that the best soldiers don't necessarily win a war - the ones with the biggest weapons do. ""To make war all you need is intelligence. But to win you need talent and material."" Other memorable gems from the text include, ""Nothing is done to oneself that one does not accept,"" and ""If you stop complaining and asking for what you never will get, you will have a good life. A good life is not measured by any biblical span."" The apt title itself comes from the John Donne quote, ""...And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee."" Thus is the nature of any conflict, regardless of the politics involved.  One reason Jordan, an American, is fighting in Spain is because he is concerned with the rise of bigotry and fascism in his own country. This belief is made all the more ironic by the treatment of the book by the Pulitzer committee and Nicholas Murray Butler in 1941, on the very eve of America's entry into WWII against Nazi Germany.

Do not be intimidated by ""For Whom the Bell Tolls."" On the surface it reads like a great adventure story with compelling characters. It is so much more than that, however. As with the very best of novels, its themes and messages are truly timeless, ringing true during the Spanish Civil War, WWII, Vietnam, and today. This is an excellent book, and I recommend it very highly.",books

657,157,216,"I normally enjoy Mr. Hillerman's works, and have a collection I like to return to over and over. This one, sadly, went straight into the box to go to the used book store. The editing was so horrible as to be a joke. It makes one wonder if his writing has always been this bad, and some UberEditor has been working magic for all these years, or if he was just under a huge rush to meet contractual obligations and couldn't be bothered to actually write a decent book.

It is also disappointing in that the story could have been exceptional, given a bit of care. This is an important issue to all the tribes, but should be just as important as a history lesson to all Americans as an indicator of just how corrupt the American government was in the past, and remains today.

Next time, I will take a little trip to the library before I automatically add the next Hillerman novel to my collection.",books

667,167,8033,"The central figure of this ugly, pathetic story is the repulsive and stupid ""Grey"" who, obsessed by the Rape of Nanking by the Japanese in 1937, goes to Japan in search of a lost film documenting the horrors of what was a case of generalized slaughter of the inhabitants of that city. Grey, throughout the book, reveals herself as a semi-savant through her learning of many kanji, although her rapid progress in spoken Japanese seemed far-fetched to me, and also as a social incompetent, a fool (she allowed herself to be gang-banged at the age of 13 and excused it on her ignorance of sex) and utterly insensitive to the extent that she torments the aged Chinese survivor of those distant events to satisfy her own morbid curiosity about what happened. This connects with cannibalism practiced by at least one (and probably more) Japanese soldier and still indulged in by an elderly veteran of the war and now a powerful and feared yakuza boss. For those of you who delight in such grotesque and ugly fables such as The Silence of the Lambs, this book will satisfy the macabre ghouls alive and well within your souls (?), but for any sane and healthy person it is best avoided. There is such a thing as too much ugliness as well as there being a quality known as good taste.

671,171,8495,"Crichton's always been one of my favorite authors; I knew I could count on a well-written techno thriller that I couldn't put down.  Unfortunately, this one doesn't deliver.  It's just too darn predictable!
Perhaps starting the book at the end of the story is too much of a giveaway (the novel starts on ""Day 7"" and then recounts the events of the prior 6 days).  Based on the events in the first few pages, you know exactly where the story is going to end when something is revealed halfway through the book.  Being told in the first person doesn't help either.  You know our protagonist is going to survive any of his numerous near-death encounters, as well as many of the other characters who are present in the first few pages.  This of course removes much of the suspense.
This is probably the most predictable novel I've ever read.  Scene after scene, as the road curved ahead, I knew exactly what was around the next bend.  Utterly disappointing in that regard.
Chrichton certainly has a stock formula for most of his ""science-gone-amuck"" novels.  Well-intentioned scientists create something that's going to be fantastic, taking shortcuts and dangerous innovations, the technology goes rogue, people die, the technology is destroyed (or is it?).  This one's ture to that previously successful formula, but again, it disappoints.  The only Chrichton novel (or movie) that disappointed more was ""Congo.""
That said, it's still worth the read.  I did enjoy it, and it's an interesting technology, with some interesting explanations of the problems, both technical and moral that are presented.

Its fundamental promise of transforming ones' organization, like that of so many management gurus, rests on the notion that the authors' sheer intelligence and brilliant insights into human nature will transform any organization into a productivity machine.

Digory (I agree with Polly, this IS a funny name!) and his neighbour Polly stumble into Digory's Uncle Andrew's study quite by accident one wet afternoon while trying to explore their row of houses via the attics. Uncle Andrew is a scary figure and frightens them, especially when Polly puts on a beautiful ring he gives her and vanishes into thin air!

Digory goes to get her but they unwittingly return with the witch, who wreaks havoc in their world before they are able to get her back again.

682,182,6900,"I think that the real point is being missed by asking whether or not C.S. Lewis was racist. The question is, what is the effect of the books on their target audience; namely children between eight and twelve years of age. What will the impact of reading about the Calormene darkies on a child.

I read these books when I was eight. As was intended I identified with the boys fighting against evil and treachary in the service of Narnia, etc, etc etc. Then in the middle of ""The Last Battle"" I hit the word ""darkies"". And I knew that he was talking about me. There was a sense of betrayal and shame and disbelief. It was a kick in the stomach.

As a eight year old black boy, I had no greater world view, nor a concept of a person being the ""product of his times."" Nor did I understand that he was probably (like it really matters) deriding Arabs and not blacks.

Its not a question of whether or not Lewis was a racist. We and our children will read many books that have some sort of bias. There is no help for it. But this man and this body of work was presented to a child as an embodiment of the worth of our society. A body of work that apparently finds some children worthless. That may or not have been his intent, but such an ambiguous message should not be touted as being so unambiguously Christian or so absolutely moral.

Setting aside religious and racial issues, this is not a well written book.  Its not horrible, but the narration wanders and unlike the earlier novels, there are no clear personalities between characters.  They tend to speak with one voice; that of the narrator.",books

But what about the history of the people who made the tools that made the tools that made the heroes?

As the year 2000 approached, Witold Rybczynski was tasked by an editor with writing about what he felt was the tool of the millennium. He ran through a list of great inventions until he hit upon the screwdriver. Just where did it come from? What were its first practical uses? Back through history he went, through the drudgery of handmade screw manufacturing, the socket-headed screw and even the story of Henry Phillips and his famous Great Depression invention. That's the one that boatbuilders claimed proved to be thirty to sixty percent more effective than any screw they'd used so far. He traces screwdrivers through several languages. In French it's the tournevis. In German, the schraunbendreher.

While the earliest mention of an actual screwdriver is found in fifteenth century literature, the concept of the screw retreats through Roman and even Greek times. The Romans, while they never had screw and screwdriver technology, certainly had bolts, nuts and screw presses. But they stole the idea from Archimedes, the Father of the Screw, in the words of the author.

Where would Coast Guard history have been without the screwdriver and screw? It's an interesting postulation. But had the screw and screwdriver never been invented, the boatbuilders and other engineers that made the tools that made the heroes would never have known what they were missing.",books

This  book, by Francis Itani, revolves around the world of a girl/woman who as acquired deafness through childhood illness. The setting is initially in Ontario, Canada in the late 1800's and then eventually alternating between Ontario and the European theater of World War I.

I must admit I had some difficultly getting into this work, but I persevered and I'm glad I did, because this book is truly a magnificent read. Once committed, I could barely stand to put the book down.

As with all great books, what makes this book special, is the quality of the writing.  The prose just seemed to flow effortlessly off the pages as time melted away. You learn things about deafness, quietness and darkness that you never really noticed before;  you begin to appreciate what people without hearing have to endure to get through an hour, a day or a lifetime. There were a couple of occasions in this book where I was taken aback with a new revelation regarding deafness; where I would just let this book slip to my lap and think about what I'd just read.

There are parts in this book that are not for the faint of heart; some of the description of the trench warfare in France and Belgium are very graphic and disturbing. (but, most likely, accurate)

All in all, a story that is quietly beautiful and at the same time beautifully sad. Really, one of my favorite books. If I had to compare it to another book for quality, beauty and heartrending appeal, then I'd pick Charles Frazier's "" Cold Mountain"". Both books have that intangible timeless aura to them that separate them from their peers.

711,211,8034,"Tokyo (or The Devil of Nanking, depending on which edition you're reading) by Mo Hayder is a book that is hard to put in a box, and that's not a bad thing. Some classify it as thriller, others as horror or even historical fiction. It's a little bit of everything. Thankfully, the horror side of it is not prevalent, it's just that some parts, especially towards the end of the story, are not for the faint-hearted. Tokyo is the story of Grey, a disturbed young British woman on the search for a film, which is supposed to exist somewhere in Japan, and which she needs in order to prove the world she is not as crazy as it seems. Her search will take her from ladies clubs in Japan to Tokyo's underground and its frightening yakuzas. The story is interwoven with a depiction of the invasion of Nanking and the ensuing massacres by the Japanese army in 1937. I won't spoil the story by saying much more about the plot.

Hayder's writing is okay. She doesn't really keep us guessing until the end about what really happened and what Grey's search will uncover, even if some aspects of me still took me by total surprise. There are enough hints at what is at stake throughout the book so that one is prepared for the grisly ending. It's a good story, however, in so far as you are kept wanting to read on to know more. The plot has its holes or bits that are hard to believe, but to be honest, it does not matter. It's a great read, which will keep you thinking for a while. Plus, it takes place in Japan and China. For someone like me who loves Japan and lives in China, it's just perfect!

717,217,6913,"Some fantasy series unfold chronologically, e.g. the Harry Potter stories. Others are told in a haphazard fashion, with the author skipping about in time over the protagonist's career, e.g. Robert Howard's original Conan stories. When Ace Books republished the Conan stories after the demise of Lancer Books, it republished them in ""chronological"" order and not in the order of original publication. This did not detract from the entertainment value of the series.

The Chronicles of Narnia follows a linear chronology through four books, then there is a flashback (""The Horse and His Boy"") and a prequel (""The Magician's Nephew"") before the series is brought to a close in ""The Last Battle."" This presents a problem for publishers: Should the stories be republished with a linear chronology but a jumbled publication order, or a linear publication order but a jumbled chronology?

There are good arguments for either order, but I prefer the the order of publication. ""The Magician's Nephew"" serves better to give back story to those already intrigued by the world of Narnia than it does to introduce the reader/auditor to Narnia. ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" is the perfect introduction to that world. As Lewis' stories progressed, the inevitable discontinuities and internal inconsistencies of a long series crept in. They would be less apparent if the stories were read in the order of publication.

The Chronicles of Narnia CD Boxed Set chose the linear Narnian chronology/jumbled publication order approach, which the listener can remedy by simply rearranging the order of the books before listening. The original order of publication was:

1. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe

2. Prince Caspian

3. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (Lewis planned on stopping the series here, but apparently it took on a life of its own)

4. The Silver Chair (Actually written after, but published before ""The Horse and His Boy"")

5. The Horse and his Boy

6. The Magician's Nephew

7. The Last Battle.

Possibly a compromise order would be to begin with the original trilogy, then read/audit ""The Magician's Nephew"" and ""The Horse and His Boy"" before resuming the series with ""The Silver Chair"" and ""The Last Battle."" I definitely recommend auditing/reading the ""Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" first, whatever you do.

Production values for the CD series are excellent and the readers do a superb job. Excellent listening no matter what order you choose.",books

S. Lewis presents the beginning of Narnia.

Polly and Digory are two children growing up in London around the time of Sherlock Holmes (that is, around 1895) in the same row of houses.  Digory's uncle has been experimenting with Magic and has devised a way to visit other worlds.  Digory and Polly become his guinea pigs to test it out, visiting two worlds: the dying world of Charn, and the newborn world of Narnia.  Along the way we meet the White Witch, the first Talking Animals of Narnia, the first joke, the first Narnian king and queen, and -- of course -- Aslan.  We see how evil first enters Narnia, and we see how that evil is addressed.

Within the Narnian arc, of course, this story is important simply for explaining how Narnia started and why a certain wardrobe acted as it did.  (And why a certain professor in a future story expressed less incredulity than expected, once.)  It may also be interesting for the Biblical stories it's obviously intended to varyingly echo and evoke, blended with classical mythological references.  (On that note, this time reading I noticed that in Narnia it wasn't woman who sinned and offered man the opportunity to sin, but rather man who sinned with the woman at worst egging him on.  I don't think anyone should particularly care about the gender blame game in either instance.  But it is interesting to note nonetheless.)

Outside the Narnian context, the story itself doesn't have as much to recommend it as other Narnian entries do.  Narnia's primal magic is excellent -- a world where anything planted just grows?  including coins, toffee, and lamp-posts? -- and the world feels distinctly and uniquely new.  But other than that, there's not a whole lot to heighten interest.  There isn't an obvious driving question to the story.  (Digory's mother, sure, but she's not mentioned enough to carry that story, or at least wasn't during this read.)  The characters have their own identities, but they exist more to play out the story than to be intriguing themselves.  And the story itself is interesting more along the lines of being informative about Narnia than being interesting so much in its own right.  Plus there are its unaddressed magical loose ends -- what's the nature of the in-between place or the mark, are those green and yellow items good or evil or simply too powerful, and so on -- which are totally unlike the magic in any of the other stories.  Which isn't bad per se, but it's less rationalized than one might want.

Overall, this story is definitely worth reading to get the whole picture of Narnia.  And that's why you should definitely read it.  But on its own it's not as great as some of the entries in the Chronicles of Narnia.

One last topic: for the newcomer to Narnia, what reading order should be followed?  Lewis wrote the stories in one order, but that order is not the chronological one, so a choice must be made.

Chronological order:

Publication order:
1. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe
2. Prince Caspian
3. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
4. The Silver Chair
5. The Horse and His Boy
6. The Magician's Nephew
7. The Last Battle

The chronological ordering is more straightforward, but a chronological book may ""spoil"" a later-in-time, previously-published book.  So there are potential concerns with either ordering.

As publication order often coincided with actual order, the only books where caution might be needed are The Horse and His Boy, The Magician's Nephew, and The Last Battle.  The last of these is last in either sequence.  No books after The Horse and His Boy directly refer to it (as best as I recall), so it too may be ignored.  That leaves only this book.

The allusions this story makes to the contents of the other are few: at start explaining that this story would explain how ""the comings and goings"" between our world and Narnia started, and at end to set up the mechanism of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.  I don't believe these brief allusions damage those stories.  Knowing that there is a lamp-post in Narnia from this book doesn't really spoil Lantern Waste in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, except to prove that that is Narnia.  But a series reader won't be surprised by this, so it hardly matters.  (And even someone not seriously reading through the series doesn't need to know these details -- the story setup primes the reader to expect magical events and explanations.)

In the end, then, I think the chronological order is the right order to read through these stories, if you intend to read them all.  (And you definitely should!)  If you're quite sure you're not reading them all -- but really, they're all short enough and enjoyable enough, that why bother? -- publication order might be reasonable.  But I think there's enough magic to each entry that you might as well still read chronologically.",books

722,222,7006,"Lewis didn't write the Narnia books in chronological order when he first wrote them.  I read them in the order that Lewis wrote them with THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE being first and THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW being the next to the last.  The ""historical"" Narnian chronology starts with THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW, but to be honest, it really doesn't matter. (Just so you read THE LAST BATTLE last.)

Reading this book (written for children of all ages, including grown ones!) will do many good things for you.  The most important thing is that it will make you love God more, love His Son Jesus more, and understand the Gospel better.  I first read THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE when I was 29 years old and I openly wept over various parts of the book as well as rejoiced over the triumphant ending.

You will want to read the book many times, as new insights about Jesus will come out each time.  It is hard to believe that a book so geared to the younger reader could have so many rich insightsinto life in general and the Christian life in particular -- but it does.

Read it to your children, your grandchildren, your nephews and nieces -- and read it for yourself.

You'll never regret it.",books

726,226,1026,"Thirty years ago, I was taught to read with this. Different pictures, same poems. I learned to imagine and believe in ordinary, yet beautiful things. Even today, in my own writing, I smile realizing how and when I learned a technique, just by listening to my mother whisper these poems nightly.

Aptly named, RLS has the reader remembering the wonderful days of playing alone and with friends, of delighting in the moment.

This edition only has eight poems. The original collection has many more. As a sampler for your child, this edition may serve well. If you are confident your child will enjoy poetry, buy a longer version, and enjoy many times the pleasure and warmth.

All of these years later, these lines to ""The Land of Counterpane"" come to mind:

I was the giant great and still

That sits upon the pillow-hill,

And sees before him, dale and plain,

The pleasant land of counterpane.

Your child will gain an understanding of classic children's poetry, of the rhythm and rhyme. They sound eloquent aloud, and read gentle at bedtime.

I fullt recommend ""A Child's Garden of Verses"" by Robert Louis Stevenson.

Pick the ones that look interesting and then start reading aloud to your children.  It becomes clear quickly why works by Dr. Seuss is still popular after all these years.  It's a tribute to his genius that so many writers tried to imitate his works but none has succeeded.

Dr. Seuss continues the tradition of Mother Goose, with the catchy, often non-sensical rhymes that are joy to read aloud and sticks in your mind.  Most children's books are not designed to read out aloud, and young toddlers quickly lose interest.  Combined with the whimsical and creative illustrations, my little sons love his books as much as I did when I was a child.  The simple rhymes of this book allowed by 2-year old to actually memorize some passages and read along with me aloud.  So...

737,237,6890,"Few adults reading this review will need to be reminded of the Narnia series, as it will be familiar to them from childhood.  On the other hand, there must be some out there who, like me, did not read them as a child.  I only read ""Lion, Witch, and Wardrobe"" and found it very confusing (too many characters!) and unenjoyable - and violent!  Probably I was too young to enjoy it, and perhaps it's quaint to say it today, but these books can be upsetting to young children not yet sensitised to violence.  As interesting and rich as these books are, an objective view must conclude that these stories are uneven in terms of the level of sophistication required to appreciate them.

A lot of debate has occurred in these pages over the order in which the books should be read.  Both the original publishing order and the storylines' chronological order are espoused.  Lewis himself apparently indicated that he didn't much care in what order they were read.  Therefore, I would propose a third order: that of increasing requirement of sophistication of the reader.  By that criterion, I would order the books as follows: 1. The Magician's Nephew; 2. The Horse and His Boy; 3. Voyage of the Dawn Treader; 4. Prince Caspian; 5. The Silver Chair; 6. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe; 7. The Final Battle.  Certianly, the first two book are very linear and have little true danger or violence in them.  The last two are surprisingly violent - the sacrifice of Aslan in LWW is as traumatizing, in its way, as the death of Mufasa in ""The Lion King.""

But what about the stories themselves?  C.S. Lewis clearly put a lot of effort into creating his fantasy world.  If it's not as much as Tolkien, it's because Narnia is a young world with little history, whereas Middle Earth is at the end of its history (at least, for its original inhabitants, the Elves).  While the biblical parallels are impossible to ignore (unless you've NEVER gone to Sunday School, a synagoge, or a mosque) they are also not preachy and they certainly don't detract from the story.  One could argue that much of Western literature takes its cue from biblical stories, because they are part of the shared knowledge of the culture.

The stories themselves are really very good - exciting adventure, with little morals slotted in to make the journey worthwhile.  This particular box set has a number of charcoal-sketch illustrations to help break up the pages of text which will help in reading to younger children.  I also like the fact that each is a separate volume, rather than a bulky all-in-one volume.  It's more expensive, but it's more palatable to break up the stories into individual chunks, as the stories are clearly meant to be.  I think these books are really best read by the parent first, then read TO the child as bedtime stories.  I think this would have helped a lot to alleviate my confusion when reading LWW for the first time as a child.",books

760,260,7000,"Like the other six Narnia books, Prince Caspian is a well told tale that is definitely worth reading. The overriding theme investigates how widespread knowledge of an original fact can become legend, then myth, and finally be forgotten all together. There is also another small subtext that I find just as interesting as the larger theme - especially in light of the author's own story. Lewis had a great love of pagan myth. He relates in ""Surprised by Joy"" that in pagan Norse myth he had an early taste of the Joy that ultimately led to his conversion. In some respects a regenerate pagan himself, it is not too surprising then to find Lewis often redeeming the pagan more broadly in his fiction. In the case of Prince Caspian, this is accomplished by the introduction of Greco-Roman deities and demigods working on the side of Aslan and the good. It is an approach that would not likely be utilized by the contemporary Christian author, but Lewis does it with his usual deft touch and leaves the reader glimpsing perhaps a bit more clearly just how completely a fallen world is being and will be reclaimed by a risen Lord. A good read, 4 stars, and certainly recommended.",books
761,261,9843,"This Johnson/Blanchard collaboration is one of the most synergistic and powerful of the Blanchard stable of management books.
The principles are simple and may come across as intuitively obvious for most seasoned managers looking for motivational techniques for their charges. However, these time-tested techniques of appropriate praising and reprimands are often not applied in a timely enough fashion to achieve their maximal effect on staff and colleagues. As a result, managers sometimes wonder why their efforts fall short of producing tangible results.
The authors seek to provide the Whys to the application of these techniques. This serves as powerful reminder to managers that although there is a price to pay in order to be a One-Minute Manager, there is a bigger price to pay if we do not become One-Minute Managers. The bigger price of course is the loss of the privilege to manage talents under our charge.
This book deserves 4 stars for its creative, succinct parable-led coaching style which has served the readers well. It is true to its title of One Minute - Short, straight to the point, immediately applicable.",books

765,265,3735,"In the first volume of this series, Braudel sets the stage for life and commerce in the period under discussion. Volume two of Civilization and Capitalism really gets the ball rolling. Or as much as anything ever gets rolling in a Braudel book.

This is fascinating stuff. But it is not easy going. The language is straight forward, but Braudel wanders around his subject, giving us mountains of specifics and following various side currents to their ends. The basic point of the volume is to outline, first, the difference between the market and capitalism, and then to trace the creation of capitalism in the markets centers of Europe between the 15th and 18th centuries.

Unlike many historian of this period, Braudel is more concerned with the world of finance than the world of production, which I find fascinating and innovative. If you care to know how the financiers of Amsterdam dealt with getting a ship in the ocean and bound for America or India, this is the place to look.

While not being an economic determinist, economics is at the center Braudel's work. Unlike many other economic historians, Braudel does take the time to deal with how culture (there a section on fashion in the first volume!) religion and other factors play into the shaping of an economic and social system. This makes for a deeply convincing argument when he demolishes Weber's idea of the protestant work ethic, but is less informed or convincing (and sometimes borderline racist) when he is dealing with non-western cultures.

I appreciate that Braudel didn't assume that by ""civilization and capitalism"" one can only mean Western Europe, but his sections on the rest of the world I found lacking. They did not have the erudition he exhibits when taking about Western Europe.

I found the book fascinating, but I think Braudel could have done with some editing. This book is not going to lay out point by point the creation of capitalism for you. You'll need to discover the steps through the examples Braudel gives. It's riveting if you're an econ and history nerd, but complicated and meandering work, which could have used a co-author (or a better team of research assistants) to handle the non western areas he covers and a editor to tease out the string of the creation of capitalism that subtly floats through this work.",books

She has shown me photos of standing only a few feet from wild Grizzly bears. I could hardly believe it, when she told me how approachable they were for experts and the pictures convinced me. Not to say, that I wouldn't keep my distance and give them utmost respect. When she told me this was an excellent book,and that I would enjoy it,I knew I was in for a great read. In other words,since it impressed her so much,it was sure to be good.

  I read a lot of ""Nature"" books and spend an awful lot of time outdoors birding and am very familiar with the enjoyment and spirituality one gets from that wonderous combination of people,animals, landscape,sounds and silence,weather and atmosphere,and all that is encompassed when one partakes in a relationship with nature.

  The excitement one gets when finding something new or just observing something seen before, is undescribable; but Schooler does as good a job of it as any nature writer that I have come across. He writes from the soul and great love he gets from living. Yes,this book is about the Blue Bear,Alaska and his friend and soulmate Michio,along with many other things,but what he really is writing about is the great enjoyment life is if one really learns to appreciate it. From this book you should learn that it is not only in Alaska that such enjoyment can be found. It is in the desert looking at sunsets,cactii and Roadrunners,in the forest searching out a Barred Owl,on the ocean watching a Tropicbird,sitting at a campsite when a Moose appears,or watching and trying to identify up to 20 different species of Gulls around Niagara Falls in the winter when it is wet windy and bitterly cold;or any of the millions of things the Creator has provided.

  I'd like to quote a few things that demonstrate the excellence of the author's writing skills:

  ""Everything always gets what it needs.""

  ""Home is not always a door at the end of a sidewalk.

  Sometimes it is a broader place that holds the shape of the

  sky,the water we drink,and the food that becomes the minerals

  of our bones,Sometimes it is the sum of our experiences and

  memories,and sometimes it is wherever we happen to be-if

  we are with the right companion.""

  ""As a photographer,,""Michio taught me how to 'look' with

  my eyes-- but as a friend,how to 'see' with my heart.""

779,279,5801,"While wandering around the woods, Shift and Puzzle come across a lion pelt.  Shift had a wonderful idea to fashion the pelt into something that Puzzle could wear and pretend to be Aslan.  Soon, word gets to King Tirian that strange things are happening.  The woods are being chopped down and decimated, killing nymphs, only to be sold for money to the Calormen.  Horses, talking horses, are being whipped into service to transport the wood.  All this seems to fly in the face of Aslan, but it is in his name that the horrifying work is said to be done.  While trying to set things right, King Tirian is captured and left chained to a tree to waste away.  It is then that he is transported, as if in a dream, to a place where he sees seven kings and queens of Narnia.  He comes to and realizes he hasn't gone anywhere.  Before he can despair, he sees a girl and boy have come to help rescue him. Eustace Scrubb and Jill Pole have returned to Narnia to assist the King.

***spoiler alert***
This story definitely felt different than the rest.  There was a lot of story in Narnia before Eustace and Jill travelled there to help out, where usually the story jumps right in with the kids traveling from our world to Narnia.  The majority of the story was about a false Aslan used to get one's own way.  It was also a bit on the nose about gods, false gods, and heaven for me.  Not really my cup of tea.  That said, I actually did enjoy the ending of Narnia.

781,281,3490,"I was expecting ""Microserfs"" to be the witty send-up of Microsoft culture and start-up angst that it is.  What caught me off guard was the surprisingly tender moments of love, life and death that Coupland  manages to squeeze in amongst the humorous descriptions and dead-on  depictions of life in Redmond and the Silicon Valley.  It's not perfect:  The plot takes a little while to get going, and there are some gimicky  moments (2 whole pages of binary code, pages without vowels).  The story  sometimes seems to barely scratch the surface of the characters' lives and  emotions, glossing over the missing depth with relentless pop culture  references and relying on Big Moments - birth, cancer, coming out - to let  us know we should be feeling for the characters.  But those very flaws are  a part of the book's post-MTV-generation style, full of quick cuts, potent  images and Pop-Up Video factoids.  Once you get past all that,  ""Microserfs"" rewards you with a creative, insightful look at geek  life and a fondly-crafted time capsule of the early 90s.  If you're under  35 and/or work in high tech, definitely give it a spin.",books
782,282,2935,"Set during the Spanish American War of the 1930s, For Whom the Bell Tolls is a novel about an American sent on a mission to help guerrilla fighters blow up a bridge.

There. That's the basic plot. It sounds like something out a an action movie, doesn't it. To stop there, however, would be doing the novel and the author a grave disservice.

When it gets down to it, For Whom the Bell Tolls is about death and how to face it. The men on this secret bridge-exploding mission are going to die, and they know it. They will not be coming back from this mission. Each of them will be facing death one way or another, and they each have to deal with it individually. The idea of suicide is even approached from a soldier's point of view; the question is raised, is it preferable to kill oneself than to be captured by the enemy?

For Whom the Bell Tolls also touches upon racism and politics, though not strictly from an American point of view.

Within this tale, violence is to be found in spades, but this is not a simple action story. This is true literature, told in the best writing Hemingway ever did (yes, I admit that's arguable, but it's my opinion ... believe what you want).

As a writer, is there anything not to learn from Hemingway? The man knew how to write tense scenes and deal with weighty subject matters all while using as few words as possible, and most of those short words. No other author in my experience has quite been able to do that.

As an aside, I'll admit that every time I read a Hemingway novel, I always hate it. Until I reach the very last page. Then suddenly I love it. Not sure why that is, but it's always been my reaction.",books

However, Coupland's obvious love of LEGO and belief in the ingenuity and creativity of young geeks give hope for family relationships and the power of friendship in an otherwise digitally meaningless world.",books

It starts with Robert Jordan an American dynamiter who has joined with guerllos to fight the fascists.  He is led to a cave by Anselmo an old man, early sixties, where there is a camp.  Pablo is the drunken leader and Pilar is his wife.  Robert Jordan is very inner sociable, he talks to himself a lot, only when he is alone usually, it clears his mind.
This book was truly amazing from the first word to the very last word.  Truly amazing, Hemingway is one of the best authors there ever was.  It would seem that he was actually there to get the details he put into this book, and you can actually see where he is and what he is talking about, and that is what the best authors do.

785,285,8083,"In the heirarchy of Crichton books, I would place this in the second tier, behind my favourite from this author (Jurassic Park, Great Train Robbery, and Timeline).  Crichton has, for me, always been an uneven writer, with duds like Sphere and the Lost World alternating with the gems.

The story is basically a monster fable, and superficially appears to be like Jurassic Park.  It is not as detailed, there are fewer characters, and the technology is not as believable (or as well explained).  The monster: swarms of nanometre-sized machines that are programmed with a swarm intellegence.  Due to an engineering error in the building in which they are being manufactured, vast quantities of these nanomachines are released into the Nevada desert.  Out there they start to evolve and develop to the point where they are attacking living creatures (including humans) to drag back to their lair as raw materials for producing more machines.

Because they are a swarm of very small particles, they are virtually impossible to destroy - you need a weapon that can fry/irradiate/magnetise all the particles in a particular swarm simultaneously.  This is the connudrum that our hero, Jack, finds himself in.  He's a software programming consultant specialising in modelling pack hunting.  His wife is a top VP at the nanomachine company.  As in all of Crichton's books, most people have their own hidden agendas and secrets that can turn the reader's whole perception of what's happening upside down.

The book is written in the first person, which means we know the main character survives until the end.  However, because he is an outsider brought in to solve a problem he didn't create, he is in the dark as to what's going on.  Not only is this a technological thriller (how do the nanomachines work and can this knowledge help defeat them?) but a psychological one (why does Ricky keep lying to Jack?  Is Jack's wife having an affair?  Have Ricky and/or Julia allied with the nanomachines to advance some hidden agenda?).  This only works because of the 1st-person telling of the story.

At the same time, this is a very fast read, due to Crichton's writing style.  He uses ""quick cuts"" (to borrow a film term) to generate a hyperactivity in the action - short sentences, short paragraphs, and each chapter is subdivided into small subsections, usually less that 2 pages long.  And the story is well-crafted, the science believable (mostly), and the characters unsually varied for Crichton.

As other reviewers have commented, the ending leaves a little to be desired.  That some plot points are totally unresolved (and unabashedly so) at the end is fine - if the narrator doesn't know something, there's no reason to think he should become miraculously omniscient at the end.  However, it does feel at times that Crichton laid one too many twists at the end, and one plot point (the question of whether Julia is having an affair) is concluded in such a way that it leaves more questions than answers.  Better for the author to have left it open than to give a seemingly contradictory explanation.

At any rate, of Crichton's books, this rates about a #4 overall (around Airframe on the enjoyment scale).  Not as well-crafted as Jurassic Park, the book it most closely resembles, but a very enjoyable and thrilling read.",books

However, I only completed and published ""The Last Battle"" review at that time.  In September 2001, I wrote a second review that went unpublished until October 2012. Review 1 is the April 2000 review.  Review 2 is the previously unpublished 2001 review]

Review 1:  Apocalyptic fiction has become a fashionable trend in the Christian market nowadays.  Yet this book, published in 1957, proves one thing: Lewis was years ahead of his time.  Although Jenkins and LaHaye are doing good  detailing their fictional account of the end-of-the-world (Left Behind  series), in what is taking them hundreds of pages, Lewis does in a short  200.  Not that that is a bad thing, because each had different purposes.  Since I'm reviewing Narnia, Narnia I will stay with.

Lewis, in his only  end-of-the-world book, tells of how in the last days of Narnia, there are  two animals living by the Great Cauldron.  One is Puzzle, a lovable Donkey,  and the other is an evil ape named Shift.  Shift, thru manipulation and  deception, tricks Puzzle into donning a lion skin, making a false Aslan.  This is representative of the Anti-Christ.  It is about how the real  Aslan and the real Tash come again into Narnia, and the final show down.

The most stirringly majestic portion of the whole book is the last part,  where the old Narnia passes away, and behold! the children and all good  Narnians who love Aslan are called into Heaven, the New Narnia.  This is  the single most precious portion of any of Lewis's fiction.  It drips of  Heaven.  The Power and Majesty of God on High is portrayed thru these  pages.  He goes thru judgement day (never mind this pre-mid-post trib stuff  or debate), and then how the children react to being in heaven.

An  interesting concept put forth by this book is a LIMITED universalism.  Emeth, who is servant of Tash, a pagan god, is found in heaven.  When Aslan  comes and speaks to him, Emeth says he was not servant of Aslan but Tash.  Aslan says that in reality he had been serving Aslan all along, and he knew  Aslan, but to him Aslan was known as Tash.  In other words, Emeth's  perception or view was not the real Tash, who was an evil being, but the  real Aslan.  To an extent, I agree that this might be possible.  I feel you  can have a relationship with Jesus, but know him under a different name.  That does NOT mean I believe all religions send you to heaven.  You still  have to know Jesus, and God.

The dwarves, who are in heaven, are to  stubborn to let got of themselves.  They perceive themselves in a horse  stall (that is where the last of old Narnia is seen.  It is night, and all  these people in a great circle or waiting for Tashlan, which is the fusing  of Tash and Aslan, exactly what the Anti-Christ is, and the children run  into the tent or stall.)  ""The Dwarves are for the Dwarves!""  This is  pride.  This is what it is like on earth.  What to us seems distasteful, if  we would really let go of our pride and let God be God, then in the end we  would have ultimate joy.  That is what Lewis is saying thru the Dwarves.

Lewis also uses classical philosophy to educate children.  The old  Narnia is called the Shadowlands, mere shadows of the More Real Heaven.  This is straight from Plato.  The values we hold dear, such as truth,  valour, honour, etc, are manifestations of its essence.  We practice truth  and valour.  That is a form of valour, a shadow.  But the essence of  valour, that is the real thing itself.  Lewis uses this concept to help the  Children better understand God.  I came across this in this story when I  was a child; I was astounded to realize it was Plato when I was in a  philosophy class in college.  That is why, in being a Christian, the more  you act like the Christ the more Christ is in you and part of you.  The  more honour you show and love you show, the more Christ is you and you are  him because Christ is the very ultimate of honour, and all the other  vitures we hold dear.  That is why God gave us the shadow of marriage, to  help us understand the very real union between God and man.  We become one  with God, just as man and woman become one flesh in sexual intercourse.  God is such an awesome God.

In the end, we have a powerful vision of  Heaven.  Although it is Narnia, the ending he detailed was as much our  world as Narnia.  His prose is fantastic.  As far as C. S. Lewis's ""Mere  Christianity"" coming out in his fiction, this is his ultimate achievement  in giving hope to the Christians on the afterlife.  This is my favorite  (from the Christian perspective) of the Narnia series.  There is so much to  learn and digest from this beautiful book.  The heart of this achievement  is that this is written for Children, and yet he packs so much meat into it  without EVER coming across as condescending OR preachy.  Truly one of the  best.

(For adult fiction, Till We Have Faces is his best.  Actually, I  think that novel is his deepest novel, and his best).
-------------------------------------
Review 2:  The Last Battle, the very last book in the Narnian Chronicles, also stands as the most impressive book in the series as far as the religious aspect goes. It also shows what LWW could have been had Lewis handled it properly. Lewis infuses Christian ideology with fantasy for fantastic results, and the result is a book that stands as one of the most beautiful things he ever wrote. There is no other prose from Lewis's hand that equals the last sections of The Last Battle and the first sections of Perelandra in terms of sheer beauty and joy.

In my own life The Last Battle has proven to be very significant because of Lewis's utilization of the Platonic concepts. I did not know it was Plato when I read Lewis, but when I took a philosophy class everything clicked, and I consider myself a Platonic Christian. This is Lewis's prime aim in all seven books of The Chronicles of Narnia. Lewis wants to provide, in story form, truths that, because he has sown the seed, when later encountered in adult life the children will be much more sympathetic to them than they may otherwise be.

Another important theme running through The Last Battle is the use of perception, and although we see it numerous times in the books we see it here the most. Those who cannot see the things of God blind themselves to it because of their own spiritual problems, and the people will not let go of their own sin to lead the life God wants them to lead. In The Great Divorce, this is the central theme of the book. People go on a bus ride to heaven, and if they wish to stay, they must give up a vice that they have retained. Only one makes the leap of faith and lets go of his red dragon, which symbolises lust. In The Last Battle, the dwarfs will not let themselves see the true beauty they would be in if they just allowed themselves the opportunity to see it.

Another thing about The Last Battle that troubles me is the presentation of Emeth. I have been undecided on Universalism as Lewis presents it. To be a radical Universalist would simply not do, and Lewis was not. I see the point he makes, and there is a side of me that really wants to believe what he has to say on Emeth, but another side of me balks at the idea. I personally would never advocate this view simply because I simply don't know if it is true or not, and as we are talking about eternity here it is not something to play around with. However, I do think this is a possibility and half the time I believe it and the other half I don't, so I simply remain undecided.

The events at the stable are very significant for all parties concerned, for it seemed the side aligning themselves with evil are now suddenly shocked to see supernatural occurrences begin, while the animals who are afraid of Tashlan are just all the more certain that he is really angry with them, but for the truly saved are hopeful. Ginger the cat is made into a dumb animal, which really scares the bad side. Rishda Tarkaan becomes terrified to realise the god he has been serving actually does exist. Emeth rejoices, for he will be able to at long last meet his love, which is Tash.

The children and Tirian do not fully realise what is in the stable, but they want to know. Tirian grabs Rishda and goes into the stable with him. Tirian has a very surprised reaction, for the Stable is much bigger on the inside than it is on the outside. This goes into the Platonic concept of the inside being bigger than the outside, and Lucy makes the remark that once in her world a stable held someone (Jesus) who was bigger than the entire world. Then the end of Narnia comes and every one goes through that stable door, which, because of its Biblical allusions, is a very approriate door to have to travel through. Either you accept Jesus or you don't, but everyone will know Christ is Lord. That, to me, is what the true significance of the Stable Door is.

--------------------
[This is a brief paper I wrote about how Lewis imparted truth to his characters and am including the text here as bonus content to the review proper:]

Lewis has his characters experience truth in a number of ways. The four works this essay will look at are ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"", ""Prince Caspian"", ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"", and ""The Last Battle"". Not all of the truth the characters encounter are what the characters wanted.

In the first book, LWW, we have Edmond who has become a traitor. Edmond does not wish to believe that the Witch is bad, because she can supply his fix. This is one of the biggest truths that Lewis imparts to his young readers: addiction blinds you to the point of where your only god is the addiction itself and you will do anything it takes to get whatever you are addicted too. Edmond is a classic case of addiction, and if this were a work for adults it would have been quite appropriate to make his addiction drugs. When the Beavers are discussing Aslan, Edmond does not like the conversation. He feels this could pose a threat to getting his fix of Turkish Delight. Like drugs, this addiction ruins ordinary pleasures, and Lewis says at the beginning of Chapter IX that memories of bad magic food spoils the taste of regular food. He is so focused on his addictions that Edmond no longer cares about real life, and he will do anything possible to get it, even selling out his brother and sisters to the White Witch, which in everyday life could be a man who will let his family go hungry or will not pay the rent because he cannot get his cocain if he takes care of the basic needs of his family. Even in this degraded state of mind, Edmond gets a realisation of the cruelty of the White Witch, for what he craves the most she will not give him. For truth to come to Edmond, he must accept this terrible fact of his being a traitor and Aslan must die for him. Aslan and Edmond have a talk afterward, which, although we are not told what is said, Lewis does tell us that Edmond never forgot that conversation and he is truly a changed boy.

In Prince Caspian, Lewis gives us another boy who is struggling to discover truth. Caspian learns from his Nurse that there is an older Narnia where Talking Animals lived and there were dwarfs and tree and water people and various creatures who claimed Narnia has their home. His Uncle Miraz, however, denies this and sends his nurse away to be replaced by a Dr. Cornelius, who, as it turns out, is a half breed of dwarf and man. It is notable that he is the only named example of interbreeding, although, according to Ford, Caspian's nurse may also have dwarf blood in her. Caspian must decide which ""truth"" he will believe, and because of his relatively good sense he chooses to belief the stories about Old Narnia. This ties into Lewis's theme about the longing for the truth. I highly doubt that, if a person is on Aslan's side (although Caspian is not to begin with), he/she will long for something in a deep spiritual sense and it not be the truth. Lewis talks of this in his Pilgrim's Regress, and it is God's prime instrument in conversion. People long for something true, and unless they are deceived by Satan, they will find their answer in Jesus Christ. It is also important to note the relationship between Dr. Cornelius and Prince Caspian. God wants to use you to help awake and feed that desire for God in someone else's life, and that is why He tells us to go make disciples of men. One reason Lewis chose Dr. Cornelius as a half breed is to illustrate we are not to perfection yet, but we are progressing toward it, and also one reason the dwarfs intermarried was so the were not killed. Sometimes, as Christians, we cannot be open about our religion but must seek God to know who we should share it with. Of course, this does not apply to America yet, for we have tremendous religious freedom. As the world progresses, however, I fear that will change. Once you discover truth, then you are accountable to that truth and must help fight for it, which Prince Caspian does, and then becomes King Caspian.

Eustace Scrubb also encounters truth for the first time. Much of the first half of the novel Eustace is a perfect ass.
Jill also encounters truth in The Silver Chair. At the opening of the novel, she learns the appropriate ways to approach God, and these ways are not Satanic, as the dark magic she suggested to Eustace as a method of getting into Narnia was. She also learns in that opening scene with her and Aslan more of the nature of God. You cannot put God in a box, and Aslan will make no promises to her what he will do, but she does not doubt his word when the Lion tells her that there is no other stream. Throughout there rest of the novel Jill learns that no matter what God says, you must do as he asks, even if it seems that you will be killed or seriously harmed or seemingly impossible, and she also learns that, through the giants of Harfang, God will take care of you even if you err, but there will be unnecessary complictions if you do not do it his way.

Perhaps the most interesting of all, and certainly rather an anomoly as mostly the examples given are good characters becoming better, but in The Last Battle we have one of the central bad guys learn that there really are supernatural forces, even though he did not believe in them. Farsight, the Eagle, notices that Rishda Tarkaan is very surprised about what is in the stable and of Shift's destruction. His discovery of the truth, however, is horrific. Tash, the god he has called on but does not believe, has come to gather his lawful prey, and Rishda is shocked that Tash even exists. Lewis uses this character to illustrate to his readers that you should be careful in what type of belief system you invoke, for the worship of Tash was a cultural practice that Rishda practice not in belief but because it the culture, and he really does not believe in anything.

These are some examples of the numerous ways in which truth comes to Narnian characters.

I highly doubt that, if a person is on Aslan's side (although Caspian is not to begin with), he/she will long for something in a deep spiritual sense and it not be the truth. Lewis talks of this in his Pilgrim's Regress, and it is God's prime instrument in conversion. People long for something true, and unless they are deceived by Satan, they will find their answer in Jesus Christ. It is also important to note the relationship between Dr. Cornelius and Prince Caspian. God wants to use you to help awake and feed that desire for God in someone else's life, and that is why He tells us to go make disciples of men. One reason Lewis chose Dr. Cornelius as a half breed is to illustrate we are not to perfection yet, but we are progressing toward it, and also one reason the dwarfs intermarried was so the were not killed. Sometimes, as Christians, we cannot be open about our religion but must seek God to know who we should share it with. Of course, this does not apply to America yet, for we have tremendous religious freedom. As the world progresses, however, I fear that will change. Once you discover truth, then you are accountable to that truth and must help fight for it, which Prince Caspian does, and then becomes King Caspian.

Eustace Scrubb also encounters truth for the first time. Much of the first half of the novel Eustace is a perfect ass.

Jill also encounters truth in The Silver Chair. At the opening of the novel, she learns the appropriate ways to approach God, and these ways are not Satanic, as the dark magic she suggested to Eustace as a method of getting into Narnia was. She also learns in that opening scene with her and Aslan more of the nature of God. You cannot put God in a box, and Aslan will make no promises to her what he will do, but she does not doubt his word when the Lion tells her that there is no other stream. Throughout there rest of the novel Jill learns that no matter what God says, you must do as he asks, even if it seems that you will be killed or seriously harmed or seemingly impossible, and she also learns that, through the giants of Harfang, God will take care of you even if you err, but there will be unnecessary complictions if you do not do it his way.

Perhaps the most interesting of all, and certainly rather an anomoly as mostly the examples given are good characters becoming better, but in The Last Battle we have one of the central bad guys learn that there really are supernatural forces, even though he did not believe in them. Farsight, the Eagle, notices that Rishda Tarkaan is very surprised about what is in the stable and of Shift's destruction. His discovery of the truth, however, is horrific. Tash, the god he has called on but does not believe, has come to gather his lawful prey, and Rishda is shocked that Tash even exists. Lewis uses this character to illustrate to his readers that you should be careful in what type of belief system you invoke, for the worship of Tash was a cultural practice that Rishda practice not in belief but because it the culture, and he really does not believe in anything.

These are some examples of the numerous ways in which truth comes to Narnian characters.

799,299,8186,"I have always been a huge fan of Michael Crichton. He is, in my mind, the most versatile and interesting writer of popular science fiction I know, and he is always able to make his stories so multidimensional. Sphere was many things: a suspenseful tale, a look at a perilous environment, and a fascinating metaphysical examination. While this book is more like Congo than Sphere, it still has plenty of cutting-edge science and more than enough suspense to keep anyone reading.
The story goes something like this: Jack Forman, former software manager and current stay-at-home dad, is baffled by his wife's recent odd behavior, suspecting she's having an affair. When he is asked to assist in the project his wife has been working on, he jumps at the chance, but his notions are soon dispelled as he discovers that there are intelligent swarms of nano-organisms on the loose. The book centers on the efforts he undertakes to stop these micro-baddies, who are able to adapt and come up with new tactics at an alarming rate.
The writing is excellent, as always, and Crichton is certainly on top of his game in writing a suspense story. It is a story that also asks interesting questions about the future of artificial life. Ultimately, it doesn't become greater than this, though. Sphere was philosophy, Disclosure was social criticism, and those were his best books. In any case, it's good to read another elegant page turner by this very capable writer.",books

806,306,8342,"Michael Crichton endeavoring to create another techno thriller like his superlative Jurassic Park, comes up woefully short with his latest offering, the preposterous Prey.
The premise behind the book is nanotechnology, the building of manmade machinery of incredibly small size.
Jack Forman a bright fortyish unemployed computer software designer with a biology background is acting as a house husband to his three children.  His wife Julia, who also has a computer background, is a V.P. of Xymos.  Xymos is a company involved in nanotechnology whose major project is being funded by the Department of Defense.  They are developing a super miniature undetectable surveillance camera which can be suspended in the air much like dust, in a remote facility in the Nevada desert.
Xymos has been having developmental problems and the D.O.D is threatening to stop the flow of money.  In addition Julia Forman has been acting very bizzarely and neglecting her family.
A desperate phone called is placed to Jack Forman by Xymos to help them correct their problems as a paid consultant.  He is flown out to the Nevada laboratory where he learns that a swarm of these mini cameras has escaped the facility.  They have been created using both biological and computer technology originally created by Forman.  Shockingly, the swarm is reproducing and evolving at a rapid pace and showing characteristics of living entities.  This evolution is being nurtured by the killing and consumption of the local animal population with the Xymos technicians as their apparent next targets.
This story is too far fetched to be at all plausible.  I'd have to however give Crichton high marks on his imagination, intelligence and the exhaustive research he obviously put in.",books

811,311,941,"Amazon seems to have grouped the reviews for several editions of A Child's Garden of Verses together, so it's difficult to tell what exactly is being reviewed.  I am commenting specifically on Tasha Tudor's lovely illustrations of childhood life, so beautifully paired with Robert Louis Stevenson's poetry of childhood.  Together, image and word are a perfect match, and this is a marvelous edition.  I highly recommend it as a gift for any new parent, a special child, or for yourself.

I live with my grandfather, who was born in 1922 and grew up having these poems read to him and then reading them for himself; when he grew up and had children of his own, he read from this book.  They were a little bit ""old-fashioned"" when my grandfather was a boy in the 1920s, but not at all ""dated"" in the way some of them have become.  I am thinking here of ""Foreign Children,"" with its refrain:

Little Indian, Sioux or Crow,
Little frosty Eskimo,
Little Turk or Japanee,
O! don't you wish that you were me?

There are others in a similar vein, and while I am sure that some will object, I find all of these poems to be utterly lacking in malice or cruelty.  They espouse the ideology of their time, and that was one of Empire.  If you don't want to read the few of these poems that mention race/ethnicity in a way that you don't like, then don't -- or better yet, how about using it as a teachable moment to discuss the ways in which views evolve over time?

The majority of these poems feel timeless, in that they dwell in the land of childhood imagination.  Just reading ""The Land of Counterpane"" sends me right back to the world of childhood and the hours and hours spent dreaming, creating, imagining.  Likewise, ""The Land of Nod.""  I know my grandfather feels just the same way, because sometimes when I tuck him in for bed at night we discuss where we plan to travel in our dreams: the Land of Counterpane or the Land of Nod.  Very few things are capable of staying with a person for 80 + years; these poems are some of them.

If you have children, or know any children you particularly like, I hope you will purchase a copy of this lovely book for them.  It's one of those books that opens a door into another world, and what the child chooses to do once there is up to him or her -- but you can give the key to the door.",books

There are no hotel/restaurant recommendations in this book...  but instead a series of walks , though all parts of the city  ( and beyond)...  Additional guide books to consider adding to this  are Michelin Green Guide to Rome,  Terroir Guide to Food in Rome and Rick Steve's Rome... which all offer food and lodging recommnedations

In previous visits to Rome,,,I felt that I was missing out ...  i.e. I would pass a ruin or monument  and could not locate any information in my guide books.... Thankfully Masson and Fort cover most all of the various sights.

Even if you do not take the outlined walks, this book is valuable..  For example, I was near to  Capitoline Hill,,, so I referenced this location, using handy index and found all sorts of nearby sights....

 This books provided the information about the ""unveiling"" at the Gesu Church, ( daily )... and this is truly one of the great sights in Rome...

818,318,7755,"As with everything Chrichton writes, the story is heavy on science--this time about nanoparticles.  He makes the science plausible, but doesn't overwhelm the reader with it.  He deals with the humans  who do the research, and the political, economic, and potential medical pandemic when the control test escapes the laboratory.  Again, Chrichton includes children who are exposed to the danger, and the adults who protect them.  An excellent read. His overuse of the ""f"" word is off-putting.  I am sure  molecular scientists know better words that that to express frustration and fear, but that seems to be the only one Chrichton knows.",books

824,324,7255,"The Chronicles of Narnia is a great series. When I first read ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" I thought it was a good book. Then I read ""The Magician's Nephew"" and understood the other book better. Afterwards, I didn't even bother to read the other five books, but, while I was waiting for the next Harry Potter book to arrive, I finally checked them out of my library and began to read them. When I got to the fifth book, ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"", I was bored with it at first, so I stopped reading it and went on to other things. A while later, I picked it up again and read on, and when I did, I was not bored at all, and when straight on to finish the series (the end of it all made me sad, even though it is a happy ending, which I won't say anymore about). One thing I did notice, though, is that the older versions of the books are set in one order (by publication, I think, in which the order is kind of wierd), and the newer ones are set in chroniclogical order, which makes more sense to me (the older ones have freaky covers, too. They are really...old).
I think these books are some of the greatest ever written. C.S. Lewis obviously had a large imagination, and he is now one of my favorite authors. The books are so well-written, and what I really liked was how C.S. Lewis didn't hesitate to put in his own comments here and there about what was going on in the storyline, and how he acted as if all the events taking place were once really true and he was just recounting them from the characters in the stories. That, plus the original plots and detailed characters, make The Chronicles of Narnia a classic series that everyone--fantasy-lovers or not--should read.",books
825,325,8006,"In many ways Michael Crichton is to science fiction what Tom Clancy is to modern day thrillers. They follow a similar formula for each book; however they manage to fill it with enough pseudoscience to suspend your disbelief long enough to finish the story. Prey is identical to Crichton's past ventures. A small group of people, often scientists, are put in harm's way out of corporate greed and arrogance. Most of who are disposed of in graphic ways. Rather than dinosaurs, time travel, gorillas, or alien artifacts, Crichton's body bag fillers are micro-robots.

Nobody reads thriller novels for their brilliant dialog and deep characters. In a way the novel works as an essay on how nano-technology could go horribly wrong. To that end it's very entertaining. Crichton is at his best when the poorly armed characters are facing a meticulously described foe. Crichton doesn't disappoint with idea of being stalked and devoured inside out by a swarm of machines for fuel. Add to that some paranoia about your fellow survivors and it makes for a great suspense story.

Unfortunately Prey doesn't feel as well told as the rest of Crichton's novels. The story is told in first person as the main character recounts the events of the last few days. The problem with this is that the character doesn't seem to realize what the reader already knows until near the end. The characters spend too much time bickering for the reader to feel any real sympathy towards them. Ultimately there are a few too many loose ends and nagging questions before the past page of the book. While it doesn't have to make perfect sense, it is fiction after all; it does have to justify the many odds and ends of the story for a satisfactory ending. Prey however it just ends with a minimum of wrap up.

Prey is worth what brief time it will take to read. If you enjoyed Crichton than you will likely enjoy Prey. I would recommend this book, though it admittedly isn't perfect.",books

This book, (featuring the same main charcters and the same zepellin like airships), seemed to me, to have a better conclusions for the various twists and turns that the heroes encountered.

833,333,4458,"At first glance, Airborn doesn't seem like the ideal adventure book to pick up, but as you read the story you can be sure your first impression is bound to change. Kenneth Oppel has spun something of a marvel here in the form of a fantasy that would make anyone wish for the ability to do what his protagonist, Matt Cruse, does. To be able to fly through the skies toward unknown adventure and unspeakable dangers. Or at least, that's the initial feeling that overcame me. The story is nicely described and doesn't focus too much on Matt's past or his father, - whom he feels closest to when in the air aboard the Aurora; He hates to be landlocked.

So much to a point his dislike of the ground can be described as a sort of phobia- or the family he leaves behind every time the airship takes to the skies. The characters - minor and major -- are wonderfully represented on page, especially the sometimes brash and overly-adventurous Kate De Vries, whom I figured would be described as the `spoiled brat who wants a life of her own, and yet cannot see past herself.' To my delight she was the complete opposite. Even a character I wanted to despise because of Matt's misfortune, Bruce Lunardi, I ended up liking in the end and was sorely disappointed by the sour hand he was dealt.

One problem I had with the story was that, my original perceptions of the story were disappointed, but it ended up being better than my expectations. Negative points about Airborn, is that the story seems to just seems to be going through the motions with no solid plot whatsoever, but it turns out it sorta did, just not the kind I expected. All in all I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good adventure-book to read. 7/27/06 ---- [a 5 out of 5]",books

841,341,2875,"Easton Press has numerous variations of this title. The 1968 copyrighted special edition was part of the Limited Edition and I believe Famous Editions. I consider it to be the best of the available editions as the rest are rather generic covers designed for an Ernest Hemingway series.

This edition contains illustrations and an introduction by Sinclair Lewis.

This was my introduction to Hemingway, and perhaps not the best book to be weaned on. I can understand why kids hate him. His writing is ""real time."" Characters are developed at a snails pace through conversation and deeds. Hemingway seems to write about every waking hour of the main character Robert Jordon. Jordon is an American helping the Spanish in their fight against fascism. The Abraham Lincoln Brigade was a famous group of American communists and various left wingers who went to the aid of the Spanish people. Their experience proved invaluable as they were recruited to act as spies for the OSS during WWII. After WWII, for their dedicated service they were barred from the CIA because they were communists.

This story likewise looks at patriotism, communism, democracy, and fascism seen at the microcosm level of Robert Jordan. It is a tale about love and loyalty as Robert meets Maria and plans to make her an honest woman when it is all over. The beginning of the book opens with plans to blow up a strategic bridge, which happens about 400 pages later. The action is slow. Hemingway writing shifts between first and third person. He has sentences without verbs. The book is lengthy and needs an editor by today's standards.

I don't know if this is how Hemingway wrote the book, but in this edition it uses the phrase ""curse word"" when a curse word should be used. It got annoying after a while. Meanwhile this edition includes an illustration of a topless woman.

But when I re-read it last year, I realized it belongs alongside the Timothy Treadwell books/films and the Ian Hamilton (elephants) documentaries/books, about people endangering the very animals they love through relentlessly habituating them to people and pestering them to the point where Hamilton and the Owens', at least, are lucky to have escaped with a whole skin.  This whole trend toward getting as close as possible to large dangerous animals is so detrimental to the animals themselves that it infuriates me.

The Owens' lions, used to people letting them roam around camp and sit down among them, and anthropomorphized with cute names like Muffin, were clearly going to get into trouble the first time they met other, less starry-eyed people in the Kalahari or in the villages and towns surrounding it. The Owens did them a real disservice.

848,348,3059,"This is a unique novel in the Hemingway collection, it has a plot. This is the longest of his novels though the easiest to describe. The Hemingway style is not as lean as in earlier works, one might even say it is pleasantly plump in comparison (as Papa himself was at the time of writing). I'll never forget my first reading of this book. One of those books you put down and just hold your breath with the memory of it all. This might best be described as Hemingway fare for non Hemingway fans. Though Hemingway fans like it too, but it will always be number three to them. The Sun Also Rises is perhaps one of the more difficult books to summarize and Hemingway's style is so new in it that the book created a buzz that has still not died down. What was not said in that first book left some feeling a bit famished. Others were intrigued by this new kind of writing that held its cards so close to its chest. In this book you get a more conventional novel of a novel though the events described in it are very powerfully told. (It is fun to see pictures of Hemingway as a reporter at this time. A world famous novelist in the field.) This book along with A Farewell to Arms prove no American knew better how to convey by written words that nasty busines of war better than Hemingway. Robert Jordan is one of the least talked about Hemingway characters ever. Perhaps because he is a character invented to serve a plot.

857,357,7342,"""People won't write the books I want, so I have to do it for myself."" --C.S. Lewis

I was very young, when one of my favorite teachers started reading ""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe,"" which is the first book I read in the series. I was so dissapointed when the teacher read right up to the part about getting through the wardrobe and then stopped. She never got around to finishing the story...but later I did.

This is a story of four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie, who are sent into the country to live with Professor Kirke because of the air-raids on wartime London. On their first morning, the weather is awful, so they play indoors.

""What's that noise?"" said Lucy suddenly. It was a far larger house than she had ever been in before and the thought of all those long passages and rows of doors leading into empty rooms was beginning to make her feel a little creepy. --The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe

Lucy finds a ""wardrobe"" with a door hidden in the back. Because The wardrobe is actually a magical door to Narnia and she enters a snowy magical world filled with talking animals. I was just fascinated when the teacher read this: ... And then she saw that there was a light ahead of her; not a few inches away from where the back of the wardrobe ought to have been, but a long way off. Something cold and soft was falling on her. A moment later she found that she was standing in the middle of a wood at night-time with snow under her feet and snowflakes falling through the air ...

The Magician's Nephew is my second favorite book. Voyage of the Dawn Treader is perhaps the most memorable because of all delicious imagery and talk of the sea. I loved Reepicheep the Valiant Mouse, he was so cute but so brave.

There are tales of magic books, sea adventures and someone naughty turns into a scary dragon (great lesson). To find out if they stay a dragon you have to read the books and I won't spoil the ending for you. All I can tell you is that when you start reading these books time won't stand still as it does when these children jump into a picture and start an adventure aboard the Dawn Treader. These books are nothing short of magical. The imagination of Lewis is so powerful that the numerous images become a part of you and you remember them forever. Through the books, C.S. Lewis weaves the morals and beliefs children need to learn. Aslan, the Lion, has great significance.

I will always thank the teacher who introduced these books to me, wherever she may be!

This set is of high quality and the pictures are now in color! I could not imagine not reading The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe first. That just makes the stories so magical from the very start.

861,361,8287,"When I first started reading this, I thought it was going to be very good. The set-up was very interesting, getting to know the protagonist, and his situation and background. There was enough science to make it seem believable, but not so much to make it slow down the story.
However, when the story got going, I thought it fell apart somewhat. There were many times when the characters did things that just didn't seem to make much sense based on the situation. And the main conflict just didn't keep me as interested as I had been leading up to it.
Also, I'm not a big fan of illogical coincidences that play a crucial role in the plot. Like Jack having written the code that his wife's company was using, it was a little too convenient. I think the story would have worked much better if that had been presented differently.
Finally, the end seemed to drag on quite a bit. I felt like I knew pretty much what would happen, but it took too long getting there.
Overall, I thought the premise was very interesting and the characters were good, but the ending seemed a little predictable and it was too slow. I enjoyed reading it, but the beginning made me expect more from the end than I got.",books

871,371,6705,"I began reading The Chronicles of Narnia after watching the new Disney film based on Prince Caspian. That movie addicted me. I watched it over and over again, and finially read the original novel. Then I started over with The Magician's Nephew and read them one after another in order. The Magician's Nephew is perhaps my favorite. C.S. Lewis goes over the top with mind opening descriptions of other worlds -- the dieing world where two children awaken the evil Queen Jadis, and the newborn, magical world of Narnia -- and contrasts them to our own world which is somewhere in the middle, but steadily becoming less like Narnia, and more like Jadis. One thing that touched me most about this book was seeing how Narnia and Aslan transform the lives of the cab driver and his wife, who end up there because of the children. We can see ourselves in the cabby. Good in our hearts, wanting truth, but bogged down, troubled, becoming lost in a jaded world. Like him, we could wish to be set free -- to become what we really are -- by the power of pure love. Moving on, The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe is also an amazing read. The four children are best when they are together, because the way they interact with one another defines their personalities. Peter is strong. In this book Susan seems strong, but even here you can sense her drawing that streangth from Peter. Lucy is good and wonderful, but not sugary sweet. Edmund is broken -- again, by a jaded world -- and we travel with him to redemption. Aslan appears rather near the end of the book to set everything right. He is an iconic figure. You can't get very close to him, and when he speaks he paints with a very broad brush. He is abtract. He is universal. It's what he does, rather than what he says, that gives you an idea who he is. The Horse and His Boy is a simple and interesting fairy tale. Not the top on my list, but very well done. Prince Caspian. The book is in some respects better than the movie, and yet there are things in the movie that I wish were in the book. For example, Prince Caspian wanted to fight Miraz to avenge his father, but in the movie he at last saw that revenge wasn't the way to go. There is less violence in the book than in the movie, so good for children. It is here we begin to see Susan losing faith, and Peter becoming too practical and less trusting; but he redeems himself by risking his life fighting Miraz one on one. Aslan decides they have learned as much from Narnia as they are going too, and so, we never see The Four in Narnia together again. The Dawn Treader. A facsinating collection of events on a voyage with Caspian, Lucy, Edmund, and their cousin Eustace. Also Reepicheep! The Silver Chair is my second to favorite. The funny parts are funnier, the scary parts scarier, the plot is especially well crafted with unespected twists, and the characters more developed. I don't want to spoil it for you, so I won't say much else. The Last Battle was, in all honesty, a bit of a let down. Showing ""the end of the world"" was a good idea, but I really don't think Lewis built up to it enough. Narnia has fought for her freedom and won several times. She has overthrown two evil witches. She is characterized by great love for Aslan and faith in him. It was awful to see the Narnians shaken and demoralized by the lies of a Talking Ape and a donkey in lion skin -- even to the point of losing faith in the true Aslan and turning on their King. The glories of the New Narnia are not quite enough to make up for such a turn. However, I do reccomend it. I read the whole book in less than a couple of weeks.

877,377,3445,"I started reading Coupland with ""Miss Wyoming.""  I missed out on those who lionized him as THE it-boy of young lit, and also missed out on the considerable backlash he faced.  I consider this somewhat fortunate, because for me he was simply an author and nothing more or less.

I'd decided to go back and read Coupland's earlier work.  That started with ""Life After God"" (which I liked quite a bit) and then continued (sometime later, actually, because all leisure time was erased for me for certain personal reasons) with ""Microserfs.""

As you probably already know, the plot involves ex-Microsoft employees who go off on their own to develop a virtual Lego program.

That's about the most you can say for a plot.  ""Microserfs,"" written as a diary of one of the coders, is a bundle of ideas and thoughts and theories.  Similar to ""Life After God.""  But while those ideas resonated with me, in ""Microserfs"" I couldn't always identify with the characters.  I could also see why there was a little hostility toward Coupland.  Occasionally the ostentation in this book is suffocating.  He's writing about self-confessed geeks, but there's an undertone of ""I'm smarter than you, hipper than you, I know more than you, and I am a pop-culture God.""

There's a feeling of emptiness for me with this book.  We are essentially stuck with a bunch of uber-smart super-geeks who have the emotional maturity of five year olds.  Would you want to be with these people?  Personally, I don't think I would.  They're smart, and sometimes very funny, but often you want to tell them to just shut the hell up already.  At some point you wish their concerns were more substantial than cereal, ""Star Trek"" and name brands.  Part of the point is that they've isolated themselves so much they haven't experienced much in the real world, but their self-obsession can become tiring.

The more fascinating issue is the time this novel captures -- that a-computer-in-every-home period when Bill Gates was still a mythical genius, and the Internet (which is actually dismissed here) started to change our lives.

These characters are so emotionally void that it's hard to truly get to know them outside of their obsessions and obvious issues (religious parents, closeted homosexuality, etc.).  Also, each character -- all of whom want a ""life"" and feel lonely -- progress along the same lines and discover themselves in the same way: namely by finding someone of the opposite sex (or in one case of the same sex) and falling in love.  It almost seems ironically simple: you're alone, you have no life outside of computers and math, so the easiest way to discover happiness is to find someone who's exactly like you who you can have intercourse with.  Hey, maybe world peace is around the corner...

So why do I give this book four stars?  Because Coupland is so incredibly talented that even a semi-misfire like this is anything but boring.  Throughout this book he will make you laugh, and he will reel off some little bon mot that will have you smiling and nodding your head in recognition.  Unfortunately, the book is just a bit too long and a bit too overpacked with this chatter.

The lack of a plot forces Coupland to dash some seriousness onto an otherwise frivolous tone and roll out one of the most sentimental endings I've ever read.  It felt very awkward to me, but maybe it's appropriate for such a diffusely written novel.

I didn't enjoy this nearly as much as Coupland's other novels, but I'm not disappointed to have read it, and I look forward to reading its pseudo-sequel.",books

888,388,1691,"Dr. Seuss has brought so much creativity and uniqueness to children's books. It is hard to even label him as a children's author, because adults love his work as well. We just use our kids as the excuse to buy the books!

Green Eggs and Ham is certainly one of his classics that has been enjoyed by several generations of readers and it is easy to see why. His books are fun to read and look at. The characters start in a simple setting but quickly progress into some silly adventure in a world that only Seuss could come up with and make so enjoyable for others. The rhyming flows wonderfully and it is fun to read out loud and play with pace of voice. Kids giggle and ask for more. Those who can't yet read, still like to look at the pages and do their best to from memory. Green Eggs and Ham aces the entertainment factor.

I almost gave it 5 stars. Even now, it feels somewhat sacrilegious to take it down to only four stars. It feels wrong in the way some people feel about a kid not being allowed to eat candy on Halloween. It's fun, shouldn't I just enjoy it? Maybe, but I am going to be a stick in the mud instead. We try to teach our kids that no means no and that peer pressure is bad. This book does not honor that. Sam is like the salesman that won't take no for an answer. He keeps pushing and pushing to close the deal. He does not let up when the other person starts getting angry. Finally, he gets him to break and try what he is offering. He doesn't just like what Sam gives him, he loves it. And that is another lesson we often try to teach. You won't know if you like it unless you try it. That is what I tell my kids about healthy foods. But that lesson is certainly not more important than the others. Sam was told no and he should have left it at that, allowing the other guy to come around on his own. I know it seems like such a minor thing, but our kids are listening. They find this book fun and a lot of kids also find it fun to pressure other kids to like what they like and do what they do even if the other isn't comfortable with it.

891,391,5121,"This is the final book in the Narnia Chronicles (which most famously includes The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe) by C.S. Lewis. I closed the book with tears in my eyes, so sorry the series was over and very tempted to start the whole thing over. What a wonderful series.

The Last Battle is about the end of the world of Narnia, and is therefore heartbreaking for all of those who have fallen in love with Narnia, as I did. In its own way, it is a story about Armageddon, about a false god who intrudes on Narnia and in sneaky and subtle ways fools the people of Narnia into believing that it and the real god are one in the same  while completely twisting good an evil together until nobody knows what to think or do.

At the same time, it still contains some beautiful lessons. One of my favorite passages in the book is as follows (keeping in mind that Aslan, the Lion, is the real god and Tash is the evil god). A soldier of the invading army is explaining to the British children (who all make an appearance in this book) what happened when he met Aslan.

Then I fell at his feet and thought, Surely this is the hour of death, for the Lion (who is worthy of all honor) will know that I have served Tash all my days and not him But the Glorious One bent down his golden head and touched my forehead with his tongue and said, Son, thou are welcome. But I said, Alas, Lord, I am no son of thine but the servant of Tash. He answered, Child, all the service thou hast done to Tash, I account as service done to me. Then by reasons of my great desire for wisdom and understanding, I overcame my fear and questioned the Glorious One and said, Lord, is it then true, as the Ape said, that thou and Tash are one? The Lion growled so that the earth shook (but his wrath was not against me) and said, It is false. Not because he and I are one, but because we are opposites, I take to me the services which thou hast done to him. For I and he are of such different kinds that no service which is vile can be done to me, and none which is not vile can be done to him. Therefore, if any man swear by Tash and keep his oath for the oaths sake, it is by me that he has truly sworn, though he know it not, and it is I who reward him. And if any man do a cruelty in my name, then, though he says the name Aslan, it is Tash whom he serves and by Tash his deed is accepted. Dost thou understand, Child? I said, Lord, thou knowest how much I understand. But I said also (for the truth constrained me), Yet I have been seeking Tash all my days. Beloved, said the Glorious One, unless thy desire had been for me thou wouldst not have sought so long and so truly. For all find what they truly seek.

As in all the rest of the Narnia books, there are battles and adventure, and though this is the darkest of them  as always in a C.S. Lewis book  there are many references to Christianity.

Thankfully, despite the ending of Narnia (and thus, the series), the book ends on a happy note in one of the best and they all lived happily ever after ending ever written.",books

As a child, I liked The Cat in the Hat Comes Back better than the original. Now my 4-year-old son agrees. He can't get enough of this absurd tale of a bathtub ring that ends up all over the house and yard. The story's imagination is breathtaking, as the cat in the hat reveals 26 more cats in hats atop his head. There's educational value, too, because the 26 little cats are named each letter of the alphabet.

This was a touching story told in brief notes left on a refrigerator in a house rarely occupied by it's two tenants simultaneously. Claire and her mom seem to constantly miss each other. Some things are easier to say on paper, but some things need to be said out loud. This novel discusses growing up and growing closer to those you love and care about.

903,403,6317,"If this were a review for any of the seven Narnia books, you would see 4 Stars (The Horse and His Boy; Magician's Nephew) or 5 Stars (the other 5 books).  But this is a review of the Box Set, and my one-star is based on one and only one thing -- the order is wrong.

You will hear people say that the order of this Box Set is the order Lewis intended (and how they know that is beyond me).  You will hear others say that it does not make sense to give 1 Star to such excellent books simply because you ""don't agree"" with the order.  So I'll keep this simple:

1) The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe assumes that Narnia is a new, novel, and unexpected place.  The reader is to be as suprised by its existence as are the characters in the book.  This is an integral element of the book and part of what makes it an all-time classic.  If you read Magician's Nephew first, you absolutely lose the novelty of Narnia when you read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.

2) If Magician's Nephew had been the first book, this series may have never made it to a second book.  As part of the series, Magician's Nephew is a good book in its proper place because it takes you, IN RETROSPECT, back to the beginning of Narnia.  But as a standalone, and especially the first book of a series, Magician's Nephew is weak.  The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, however, is arguably the strongest of the 7 and therefore the book to read in its true first position in order to kindle your interest in Narnia.

3) Note the age of the earthly characters in each book.  If read in the proper order (TLTWATW first), the series follows a natural age progression -- growing with the reader if you will.  If you read the Magician's Nephew first, you begin with a series for 13-year-olds that regresses to a series for 8-year-olds and then slowly progresses to end with something appropriate for 14-year-olds.

Mrs. Erskine does a brilliant job at bringing a woman and her family who have been dead for over 800 years to life as well as painting a vivid portrait of not only the world they lived in, but the daily realities of that world .The story is engrossing and well researched as far as I can tell (although my knowledge of English history is still very rudimentary).
However, the book is also entirely too long. It took me about 5 days to read it and at times, the narrative dragged and became very repetitive and I found myself wishing that I could just get to the end.
As tragic and gripping as Matilda and her son's death scene and other passages was , I sighed in relief when I came to the last page.
I feel the story would have been better told if the book was about 200 pages shorter.
As a last positive note,I'm very glad that this book was written because I feel that it exposes Matilda and her story/horrific fate/ to a large and continuing audience that would likely never hear of her otherwise.
Lord knows that a woman and her son being thrown into a dungeon and starved to death on the direct and deliberate orders of a monstrously cruel King should never be forgotten. The suffering of both , both physically and mentally, before death finally came must have been unbelievable.

PS- To any history buffs- while this book is based on real people and events and is basically accurate, one should be aware that there are events that by the author's own admission never occurred , such as Matilda's great love affair with a handsome,dashing nobleman(who also really existed), others are the pure speculation such as Matilda's rape by the same king that would later order her death- King John.
If using such devices to ""spice up a story"" and speculation about real people and events irks you then you should definitely stay clear.",books
905,405,8532,"ITALY: THE BEAUTIFUL COOKBOOK is just that - a book brimming with known dishes and as well as rarities from throughout Italy presented in a format so well designed, filled with excellent photography, and thorough information about the country that it could rest as comfortably on the traveler's coffee table as in the gourmet's kitchen.

Lorenza De'Medici takes the reader on an insider's tour of Italy with readable maps, stunning photographs of each region, information about the peculiar characteristics of the regions that inform the recipes, and then gives some of the finest recipes you'll likely to encounter for dishes both simple and complex.

As with the best of cookbooks this one contains images that show how the result of the time spent in the kitchen will look. De'Medici writes with candor and in a relaxed inviting style.  This survey of Italian culinary arts and the historic background that accompanies them is as fine as any similar book on the market. Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, December 05",books

909,409,6933,"""Prince Caspian"" is the second book that C. S. Lewis wrote in his children's fantasy series ""The Chronicles of Narnia"".  If you are reading the books in chronological order, as opposed to order of publication, it is the 4th book. ""Prince Caspian"" finds the heroes of ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"", young Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, returning to boarding school a year after their first adventure in Narnia. As they sit waiting at the railway station, the four siblings are whisked once again to another land, where they find the ruins of an old castle that looks eerily familiar. While only a year has passed in our world, centuries have passed in Narnia. Humans from the land of Telmar invaded Narnia long ago and persecuted the talking animals, dwarves, and magical creatures. But now young Prince Caspian, who is sympathetic to the creatures of Old Narnia, is in line to become King of Narnia. His uncle, King Miraz will do anything to prevent it.

For those reading the books in order of publication, ""Prince Caspian"" is the first book to hint at broad human participation in the Narnian universe, although it poses more questions than it provides answers. As to Narnia's past, the plot thickens -encouraging readers to press on for answers in the other Chronicles. The dialogue in ""Prince Caspian"" has been improved over the often awkward conversations in ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"". C. S. Lewis seems determined not to write protracted battle scenes, this time finding a way to avoid the great battle entirely. Not much happens in ""Prince Caspian"", but brevity is one appealing aspect of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"". Whatever may be said of them, they don't bog down. Although one may glean a few moral lessons from ""Prince Caspian"", it is not so full of them as ""The Lion, the  Witch, and the Wardrobe"". This is primarily an entertaining adventure story for young children.",books

Chrichton - a new wonderful technology is invented.
Then someone makes a shortcut in order to meet

Then things start to go horrible wrong. Death
and mayhem follows.
  Here nanotechnology is the new cool technology.
The mistake is putting your designer organisms

  So, the plot is pretty predictable,
but somehow it doesn't matter as suspense builds.
Finally, you do become desperate to know how our hero
is going to make it out of the mess.

by humans are just waiting to happen.
And surely, they will by accident be released

nano robots! And they are not dumb, as they coordinate
their intelligence in a swarm.
Working together to accomplish some goal.

921,421,6931,"I rarely find a book that I don't want to put down. The Magician's Nephew was such a book. The story moves along quickly, and is written in an easy to read style that doesn't bog down your mind with details, but rather opens your mind and allows it to fill in the details.

From his writing style, you can tell C.S. Lewis is from another era. Compare the Magician's Nephew, to say the first page of a modern day fantasy bestseller such as The Sword of Shannara, by Terry Brooks, and this becomes apparent.

The Magician's Nephew is a book that is story driven, and the story takes place is various world that leave you wanting more detail instead of bogging itself down by placing 6 adjectives upon every tree, as is the case in much modern fantasy. 2 children, Polly and Digory take a journey that includes many memorable stops, and end upmeeting Aslan and watching the birth of Narnia.

You will love this book. You will read it in a day. You will want to read the next, and the next. I consider the Magician's Nephew to be one of the most memorable books I have read in a long time. It's amazing what a good story can do, that hefty adjectives can never do.",books

This is probably my favorite book in the series, as you get to see the origins of Narnia, and all it's inhabitants.  Also, finding out how the lampost got there, and how the wardrobe became a portal to it is all very interesting.  The new characters introduced are also very good in this book.  I imagine that this one would suffer dramatically, though, if read first, as it is now marketed.  Most of the enjoyment in it comes from seeing the genesis of things you're already familiar with from other books.

931,431,8162,"This was a mildly enjoyable read, but certainly not compelling or breathtaking story (as the flap synopsis would have you believe).  The plot is contrived, the characters are not well developed, and there are character imponderables not explained.  There is suspense and a fast pace, but they are not well molded.  And while there is a plot twist towards the end that is interesting, the story ends abruptly, like a steam engine that just runs out of heat.  Not what you would expect from someone of Crichton's caliber.
The story revolves around a nanotechnology project in the Nevada desert.  A small research firm is working a Department of Defense contract to develop a battlefield intelligence-gathering system based on a cloud of nanocomponents.  These would act in concert, forming a composite lens and communications system that would have a high degree of survivability against conventional enemy countermeasures.  To complicate things, ""The nanoparticles in the cloud had to be endowed with a rudimentary intelligence, so that they could interface with each other to form a flock that wheeled in the air."" (pg. 125)  The flocking capability would enhance usefulness as well as survivability.  Unfortunately emergence theory came into play during testing and development, which led to rapid evolution towards self-awareness and a survival instinct.
Crichton does a reasonable job of explaining the technical basis underlying the plot.  He takes us through nanotechnology, artificial distributed intelligence, flocking behavior, and so forth.  This is what saves the book.  It's worth reading, but really only for the science in it.",books

935,435,6535,"""The very first tear he made was so deep that I thought it had gone right into my heart.""

Edmund and Lucy Pevensie are staying with their cousin, Eustace Scrubb, a nasty little boy with no imagination.  One day, while admiring a painting of a Narnia-esque ship in one of their aunt's rooms, the trio are whisked inside the painting and set upon the Dawn Treader, King Caspian's ship.  His quest?  To find out what happened to seven lords that Miraz had sent out to explore the Eastern Sea.

I Liked:
This book was a joy to listen to again.  I had forgotten so much, and, now that I'm older, certain scenes meant a whole lot more to me now.
Firstly, we have Eustace Scrubb, who is a perfectly unpleasant boy.  I love how he rubs people the wrong way, how much of a stick-in-the-mud he is, and his entire character arc.  His struggle being the dragon and having to rely on someone else to return to human form are some of the best pieces of Christian allegory in the entire series.  As Aslan helped him out of the dragon skin, I was nearly in tears.  The scenes were well-written and definitely NOT clubbing Christian ideology over your head.
Other characters were good too.  Edmund is always amusing, and I did love the part where he bickers with Caspian over the rule of Narnia.  Caspian is much more enjoyable and active; Lewis did a good job ""growing him up"".  Even Reepicheep, who will never be my favorite character, was far more interesting here than in his debut novel, Prince Caspian.
I love the adventure story, the traveling to all the foreign, unexplored islands, and how different each one was.  The island of Dreams was haunting, almost horror-like (without being too scary for the little ones this was meant for); the island of gold was enlightening; the island of the Dufflepods was interesting.  Each place showed something new about the characters and their personality and growth.
I adored the humor, or should I say, light-hearted tone of the book.  The book didn't stay very dark and plenty of the characters made jokes throughout.

I Didn't Like:
First thing I didn't like (unfortunately) was the narrator's voice for Reepicheep.  Yes, I understand the character is a mouse, but listening to a squeaky, high-pitched voice is NOT what I had in mind.
While most of the allegory is tamed down, I still wasn't fond of the deus ex Aslan.  Every time the characters encounter something, Aslan immediately steps in and takes away all of the conflict.  For instance, at the Island of the Gold Pond (Not the real name, my name), Edmund and Caspian begin to argue over the rule of Narnia.  Almost instantly, Aslan appears, wipes their memories, and the kids are like, ""Huh, what were we doing?  Mmm, must not be important, let's leave.""  What a way to remove any possibility for character growth!

Dialogue/Sexual Situation/Violence:
None.
Caspian gets married at the end of the book.
There are a few battles, one between Edmund and Caspian, one amongst slavers, and one with a sea creature.

Overall:
This was a very enjoyable novel.  I loved traveling on the ship with the children as they explored the unknown.  Even the narrator's voice for Reepicheep and the evaporating conflict can't get rid of the good feelings I have finishing this book.

937,437,2910,"The decades since Hemingway's death have not been kind to his legacy. While still revered as a pillar of English literature, his life seems to have chipped away at his work.  Most find Hemingway's writing too dry or his stories clustered with masogny and booze. To be fair the critiques have some relevance, but behind every Hemingway story lies a heart fractured, but aspiring for peace. For Whom the bell Tolls was my fourth Hemingway and I can honestly say my favorite. There is so much to marvel at that my meager attempts at a review do the book no justice, but it's the way Hemingway writes and the subtle beauty that he evokes that made this novel so enjoyable for me.  Hemingway's prose style is so intricate it at once appears etched in stone, but  light as a feather.  Hemingway shows how war not only changes the way we feel and act, but the bonds we form with the ones around us.  Robert Jordan's relationship with Maria is one of the few hemingway's love stories that I felt connected to, and while a bit dated in today's world I still was touched by the love they bore one another.  Maria is encapsulated in a blanket of femine weakness, but she is bolstered by the mighty Pilar.  I find Pilar to be one of hemingway's most fascinating women. Endless papers can be written on her alone, and I found her to be so multifaceted.  Besides being one of hemingway's best novels, it's also one of his longest.  At first I was daunted by 400 pages of dry Hemingway prose, but by the end I was looking for more.  Besides shining light on an area of world history few even know existed(the Spanish Civil War), Hemingway's story is universal in it's telling by including themes of fraternity, nationalism, and the multifaceted definitions of courage.  I have a new respect and love for Hemingway after reading this remarkable novel.  While Hemingway may not be everyones cup of tea, but those looking for a good and memorable story should look no further!",books

The plot revolves around Grey, a young woman with an obsession and motives which are all her own.  Grey is driven by a need to prove that Nanking was the site of a horrible atrocity by the Japanese in 1937, despite an almost total lack of evidence that anything occurred.

(Hey, I just proved Dr. Crichton's point and I didn't even have to create a race of super-powered machines to do it.)  I'm just glad I got it out of the Borders bargain rack instead of paying list for it.

WARNING - HERE BE SPOILERS...

1) The characters are flatter than lavash bread.  Jack is the put-upon saint, Julia is the career-chasing harridan, Ricky is the too-slick corporate type, and so on.  I've read better characterization in ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" fanfiction.

2) Oh-so-convenient plot twists.  The techie gurus involved in the Xymos project just happen to need an expert on evolutionary programming, which Jack just happens to have pioneered, so they just happen to fly him out to their top-secret research lab which just happens to be 160 miles from nowhere in the Nevada desert.  Sorry, that's just a little too much coincidence for my diet.  Oh, and by the way, Dr. Crichton:  You've done the science run amok thing many, many times before, and considerably better.  Find a new hobbyhorse, please.

3) Shoddy research - and since this is allegedly Crichton's forte, this upset me more than anything.
* Please pick an element - either the nanobots are carbon or silicon.  If they're C, there's no reason to eat the memory chips; if Si, no reason to eat bunnies/snakes/humans.  (Then too, if silicon was all they wanted, why only take the memory chips and leave the CPUs and such alone?)
* The 'bots should never have been able to survive their own manufacturing process.  We know from the first few chapters that a hospital MRI will kill them, and those typically run at 1-3 tesla.  A 33-tesla magnetic field, pulsed or not, would fuse any nanoscale metallic assemblage into unusable slag, to say nothing of frying pretty much any electronically based memory storage system.  (My Palm gets scrambled whenever I walk inside the 10-gauss limit of the chem building's NMR unit - that's only .001 T.)  All they would have had to do to kill the 'bots permanently would be to pulse that sucker a couple times.
* Phage viruses do ugly things to bacteria, but they wouldn't touch any non-bacterial organism - like, oh, a 'bot.
* Crichton's handling of computer programming hasn't improved any since ""Jurassic Park.""  When Jack goes code-diving into the 'bots' programming, I was painfully reminded of the BS hacking displayed by the kids (it was Tim in the book, Lex in the movie.)

4) As a previous reviewer said, plot holes a T. rex could stroll through.  The last chapter (I refuse to call it a conclusion) raises more questions than it answers.  The just-happens-to syndrome also recurs in full force.

The only thing that saved this book from a complete pan?  One of the programmers is depicted as wearing a ""Ghost in the Shell"" T-shirt.  (For those who've never hung out with an anime otaku or watched late-night Cartoon Network, GITS is a famous Japanese animated drama, which began as a graphic novel and spawned two animated movies and a TV series.  It deals with a computerized world in which a rogue program evolves to sentience within the Internet, and how it interacts with the human world.  GITS was the inspiration for ""The Matrix,"" and it's also one of my favorite anime series.  Dumb, but true.)

None of the rough edges have been smoothed off which, come to think of it, is just as Claude would have wanted: Jean speaks with his own voice.  You have to listen well, but you know that the voice is nobody else's.
I suppose it helps to know a bit about the Impressionists to enjoy it all, but I can't say I know all that much, and I didn't feel impaired.  Anyway, God bless Google: more than once, when Jean talked about a painting or a subject, I key-clicked my way to an image and completed (as it were) the picture.
Kudos also to NYRB (this time) for producing what it does not always produce: a finished physical specimen  The paper feels like quality; the binding is sturdy, and there is a small but satisfying selection of pictures, both colored and black-and-white.  There is even an index of sorts (I assume from the original translator) but it is patchy and incomplete.  That last is a shortcoming, but forgivable in light of the book's other virtues.  In the NYRB firmament, this is surely a star.",books

965,465,7030,"This set is hands down both my favorite fantasy series and my favorite children's book series. I've read them to myself, for my own enjoyment, and I've read all seven books out loud to my kids. Reading them out loud is a great experience. At the end of a chapter, when I had intended to quit, the kids would beg me to keep reading! Every one of the kids, from 5 to 15, were spellbound.

I strongly feel, however, that the books should be read in the order they were written, and as Lewis intended them to be read. That is: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; Prince Caspian; The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; The Silver Chair; The Horse and His Boy; The Magician's Nephew; The Last Battle.

Many people are only familiar with the first book because of the just-released movie (which was good, but not great). I also found The Voyage of the ""Dawn Treader"", The Horse and His Boy, and other books in the series to be just as delightful, with equally enchanting characters. There are excerpts from several of the books that I find simply and profoundly unforgettable. And last, but not least, the Christian symbolism is refreshing, and at times deeply moving.

969,469,2865,"For Whom the Bell Tolls is Ernest Hemingway running a bit to flab. A master of constructing concentrated scenes of great power, often using dialogue alone, or with vividly rendered details sparsely catalogued, Hemingway I think starts to get lost when he begins piling up the words, and nowhere did he pile them up more than in this work, his longest ever. That's not to say that as a consequence the novel is a failure. In fact, there are many fabulous scenes in this novel, from the excruciating narration of how one village executed its fascist sympathizers and another executed its Republican mayor and his wife, to scenes where characters verbally joust while the underlying tension almost sweats from the walls. There are also vivid battle scenes where we feel the intensity experienced by the characters and another involving a sojourn across the battle lines to deliver an important message.

Unfortunately, there are also a number of scenes where the dialogue spins off into desultory BS sessions to no great purpose, and extended internal monologues that feel like Hemingway never edited down his raw rough draft. Perhaps worst of all are the intimate interludes between the central character, Robert Jordan, and the heroine Maria, which to me are some of the silliest sex scenes I've ever read (""little rabbit""?). These scenes cartwheel into the offensive when they imply that the worst thing about the gang rape Maria experienced is that it might be a turn-off for Jordan. Frankly, I found Hemingway's vicarious need through Jordan to be the virile but sensitive manly man to the naive, submissive, sexually and psychically damaged Maria rather creepy.

As for the length of For Whom the Bell Tolls, I think it was very deliberate on Hemingway's part. When the novel was published in 1940, Hemingway was coming off a lackadaisical decade in which his only major works were a pair of rather self-indulgent nonfiction works about two of his hobbyhorses, bullfighting (Death in the Afternoon) and big game hunting (The Green Hills of Africa), and the slipshod ""novel"" To Have and Have Not, which reminded nobody that the same guy had also written The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms. True, he had also produced a number of very fine short stories (""The Snows of Kilimanjaro,"" ""The Short Happy Life of Francis MacComber"") during this period, but Bells to me just seems like Hemingway's deliberate attempt to show that he can produce prose in volume with the best of them. But like I said, that's not playing to his strengths.

One other note I would like to mention is Hemingway's take on the internal politics of the Spanish Republican side, which were dysfunctional to say the least. He seems remarkably sanguine about Soviet influence, which seems very naive compared with the much more measured view taken by George Orwell in Homage to Catalonia. Of course, by the time For Whom the Bell Tolls was published, in late 1940, the verdict was in in Spain (the ""good guys"" lost) and the fascists (Germany and Italy) and the Communists (the Soviet Union) had gone on to other predations.

I'm sorry for dwelling more on the faults than the virtues of this book in this review. I really did enjoy reading it again, but I figured the virtues were already well documented by the many five-star reviews here, so I thought I'd give my thoughts on things that haven't been mentioned as much but which I think are important to keep in mind when reading For Whom the Bell Tolls.",books

974,474,3893,"This is a wonderful first novel about sound, silence, deafness, communication and love. Grania is a young girl who loses her hearing at the age of five. Her guilt-ridden mother refuses to accept that she is deaf and resists adapting to reality; only Grania's loving grandmother saves her from a life of illiteracy and loneliness. Grania is taught to read with ""The Sunday Book,"" a precious gift from her grandmother that becomes a metaphor for life's struggles and complications as Grania emerges from childhood, attends school, and meets ""Chim,"" a hearing man who loves her stillness. Just married, Grania must return home to wait while Jim goes to war as a stretcher bearer.
Once again, WWI emerges as incredibly pointless and bloody, as men are thrown into the confusion of the European front. Jim experiences the war as a haze of brutal sound. He steels himself to the sight of mutilated men blown apart, but cannot stand the sight of their hands, which of course for him had become the instruments of his personal ""language of love"" with Grania. Meanwhile at home, a beloved friend from Grania's childhood who became her sister's husband returns home, mute from a horror no one can imagine. Drawing on the foundation of love from her grandmother, the deaf Grania not only coaches him back to speech but heals her sister as well. The end of the novel feels tantalizingly like only the beginning for these wonderful multi-dimensional characters.
Itani is a wonderful writer, and manages to convey to those of us who hear what it's like not to be able to--she also shows what we the hearing might be missing! The background on the theories of language and teaching the deaf was fascinating, and Itani must have done some meticulous research. This is a wonderful novel well worth your time.",books
975,475,3507,"The British Are Coming! The British Are Coming!

No, his book is not about the ""War"", rather it's a superb mystery/thriller brilliantly written by British author Robert Goddard.

Beatrix Abberley boldly confronts an intruder in her home and is brutally murdered.  What is so bizarre about this heinous crime is that the dialogue suggests that she was actually expecting the perpetrator and she knew what he was going o do and why he was going to do it. We soon find out that weeks before her murder she asked a confidant to mail four preaddressed letters to four different individuals in the event of her death. These letters will contain the reason for her murder and will reveal who the murderer is. Charlotte Ladram, Beatrix's niece, doesn't have long to mourn the murder of her elderly aunt when she is involuntarily pulled into a tangled web of betrayal and lost loyalties. As she enlists help from a most unexpected source she discovers a twisted connection between her aunt's brutal murder and a long lost secret from the Spanish Civil War.

Hand in Glove is part mystery, part thriller, part police procedural (although Goddard convincingly finds a way to tone down the necessity of the police). The characters are wonderful. They are lively, exciting and jump right off the page. They have distinct personalities.  As I read each page I felt as if I were standing right there watching all the action and listening to their dialogue.  Which brings me to my second point, the dialog is fresh, natural and incredibly engaging; never stiff or boring, and the author uses it expertly to shape the characters and move the story along at a good clip. The plot is well formulated. There is something here for everyone. Every nuisance is covered, every action brings new revelation.  And Goddard's research is implacable. He has given us keen insight into an interesting historical period.  HAND IN GLOVE is all that you expect a thriller to be and more. Goddard masterfully proves that fiction can go beyond mere entertainment and can inform and enlighten (as well as delight) readers when written well.  One caveat...towards the end of the book, as the plot begins to unravel and secrets are revealed, the events and characters get a little complex. Stay with it, all will be settled in the end.

This is a superbly written novel!  I am looking forward to reading Goddard's other titles.

Enjoy.

977,477,2996,"It's difficult to point at one work of a writer like Ernest Hemingway and claim it to be the best, but that is the claim that I would make for ""For Whom the Bell Tolls.""

This is a story that captures both the true spirit and the doubtful minds of war. It portrays both courage and cowardice, in the beautifully descriptive words that Hemingway was known for. His main character Robert Jordan is an American college instructor who leaves his job to take part in the Spanish Revolution, with a strong conviction in his heart and truly believing that he can make a difference. The story encompasses a time frame of slightly less than three days, during which he plots to blow a strategic bridge at precisely the right time. In those three days he falls in love with a young Spanish girl in the encampment where he is awaiting that moment and is involved in a character conflict with one of the guerrilla fighters by the name of Pablo.

This is a well paced story and never boring, with action suspense and romance, all coming together in a setting where you can feel the cold and smell the forest in the way that only Hemingway can describe it. A splendid and beautifully told story that I would recommend to anyone of any age or gender. For that reason I would place ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" at the top of the heap among all of his works.

In my opinion this great story is the pinnacle of Hemingway's talent. A must read for anyone interested in great literature.",books

984,484,2930,"I have just finished reading the Kindle edition of ""For Whom the Bell Tolls."" In this book, Hemingway speaks from the point of view of a third person omniscient narrator, that is, the narrator sees into the minds and emotions of all the characters from whose point of view the story unfolds.  In this way Hemingway demonstrates his genius for having accurate and sensitive insight into the human spirit.

I am impressed by the way he is able to express passion, especially in the sex scenes, under the constraints of early 20th century censorship.  I read this book simultaneously with Sandra Brown's ""Hello Darkness,"" reading six chapters of Hemingway to every five chapters of Brown so that I would finish both books at the same time.  This truly provided a contrast of how human passions were expressed in early 20th century novels compared with how they are expressed today.  You should try it!  It's an eye-opener!  What some would judge as repetitive prose in Hemingway was actually a literary device he used to bring the reader into the experience, and in my opinion (and of course, the opinions of countless other readers and critics) Hemingway succeeds famously. I also found it very amusing to read how Hemingway skirted around the expression of ""unprintable"" language, a hindrance contemporary authors no longer need to be concerned about <g>

Another device Hemingway uses in this novel is to make his characters ""think"" in Spanish but ""speak"" in English.  This is not easy to accomplish successfully.  Because I am bi-lingual, I found the rhythm of the prose quite natural, but I wonder how the experience would be for an only-English speaking reader.

This is my second Hemingway novel and I am so grateful that I have been introduced to Hemingway on Kindle. Because I read this on Kindle for PC, I was able to conveniently and quickly look up not only the definitions of words I did not know but also the translations of Spanish phrases with which I was unfamiliar.  Thank you, Kindle!  It made reading this book much more interesting and informative.  It has also spurred an interest in the history of the Spanish Revolution which took place in the decade before I was born.  Of course, Kindle has satisfied that curiosity as well.

This is more than a worthwhile read for anyone who enjoys war novels.  One learns so much from reading; I've always said fiction is the best medium for speaking truth, and Truth (whatever that means to each one individually) abounds in this book.  Enjoy!",books

988,488,8220,"By this stage anyone who picks up a Crichton novel should be well prepared for the formula: new technology full of hope & promise, unprincipled scientists/techno-freaks out to make a buck regardless of risk, ponderous hero who always intuits that ""something isn't quite right here"", technology runs amok, scary chase scene, hero wins out in spite of all odds, cautionary message bashing science & technology in wrap-up. I don't mind formulas when I am looking for an escapist novel & in the past Crichton has managed to throw in enough character development & believable science to keep me reading. Alas, PREY seems to have been written on the back of an airline safety card while stuck in a holding pattern over San Jose.  The characters are tissue thin, the dialog is unbelievable, and even the monster (a cloud of self-programming nano-particles that are supposed to be the Pentagon's next super spy camera but of course have ideas of their own) fails to grab our attention. I suppose that I should be grateful that we are spared much of the pseudo-philosophizing & gratuitous chaos-theory invocations that kept creeping into Crichton's 90's novels (we do get gratuitous fractals in PREY, but they are blessedly less obvious) but he still hates science & scientists & perhaps it is time to look for other villains? The pity is that nano-technology and self-organizing computer networks are indeed exciting & potentially scary new frontiers in technology & I feel that Crichton COULD have made an excellent novel around them (witness for instance his still provocative book on psycho-surgery: TERMINAL MAN, which even a quarter of a century later makes one pause & ponder.

990,490,707,"This is the first time that the 'Little Engine' has been published as a deluxe picture book. For this reason alone, it is unfair to compare it to the previous editions. The older editions are illustrated with small, simple, colored line drawings rather than lavish, full-page, full-color paintings.

Long's illustrations are beautiful and, in my opinion, suit the story better than the old ones did. As I child, I was never quite sure if the clown and dolls were toys or people. Long's illustration makes them obviously toys.

Long's illustrations give the different locomotives distinct looks and personalities. The original illustrations for both previous editions of the book have locomotives that are virtually identical, except for being different colors. The passenger engine in Long's illustration is a sleek, streamlined design with an arrogant, sneering expression, while the freight engine is a massive, dark iron, whale-like machine that looms over and peers down at the tiny clown.

It's unfortunate that the review from the School Library Journal was chosen by Amazon for the Editorial Reviews, above. I'd like to correct some errors - the writer has her facts wrong about the history of this book.

What Burg believes to be the original edition of the book is, in fact, the 1954 edition with illustrations by George and Doris Hauman. Although Burg praises the '1930s' look of these illustrations with the green poka-dotted clown, they scream '1950s!'. While most people today are familiar with this version, I think the older illustrations are showing their age, and I believe children today will relate better to Long's paintings. Also, as I have stated above, I believe Long's illustrations help tell the story better.

The actual 1930s illustrations were colored line drawings by Lois Lenski, and few people today will have seen them. Interestingly, those illustrations show the story taking place in a stark, snow-covered winter landscape.

Burg claims Loren Long's paintings have a '1950s' look. Anyone familiar with painting styles of the 1930s will recognize the influence of painters like Grant Wood on Long's style. Long's illustrations are much truer to the 1930s than the 1954 illustrations are.

This book isn't particularly huge, but it is legitimate in its recipes. I have tried several recipes from this book and they've all come out wonderful and comparable to the ""real deals"" that I've tasted over in France myself. There was no need to alter any of the ingredients or amounts, as so far I've had no failures/disasters in cooking from this book. It is divided up into sections (poultry, fish, desserts, etc.) and each section opens first to an introduction to a region of France with a little bit of background. The book provides pictures for almost every recipe they list, which I know can be helpful to some readers/cooks to know what it is they're cooking.

I would say, though, that some of the recipes might require you to be a little adventurous, as of course these authentic recipes require foods that Americans do not normally eat very often (like lamb and rabbit, for example).

1004,4,4256,"Steven Spielberg uses the concept of urban paranoia to dismantle it, to expose it and to denounce it. The intervention of extraterrestrials in our society starts a real panic among many people, and at the same type mesmerizes some who are invited in a way for the grand coming that is announced by this open show of power and benevolence. Then the film analyzes the reaction of authorities. Military authorities are obsessed by limiting the contact of these ETs with the population, hence they evacuate the area where the meeting is supposed to take place, they establish a whole fear and even fright process to convince the population that they must go away or stay away,and they constantly think of danger, instead of thinking of potential opening. On the other side the scientists, strangely dominated by a Frenchman, are jumping on the occasion to open their minds, to seize the day, the night and the new vistas that open up to them.
The capture of a child gives a tremendous sentimental and affective dimension to these contacts, because he does not know fear and only sees what it is for him : a contact with a new toyland, with new playmates. The whole deal is to surrender all the men the ETs have captured over the previous decades, and the equipment with which they had been captured, such as planes and boats, in exchange for a new batch of volunteers to go with them for exhanges and a visit to this extraterrestrial world. The suspense in the film is created by a man who was visited a couple of nights before on the road and who manages to go through all barriers and to impose himself on the trip, with the complicity of the Frenchman.
What is admirable in this film is that the ETs are shown as absolutely mature and our society, at a scientific level, as being ready to experiment, to take risks, to engulf in an adventure. It is a very positive approach to the problem and this is refreshing. Steven Spielberg manages to literally mesmerize us by organizing a real ballet of light and colors and music as the way these ETs can communicate with us (music and colored lights) and can demonstrate they power as well as their total un-agressiveness (the ballet of lights and beautiful movements  in the sky). He also evades the necessity to show the ETs by blurring their rather childish forms in a nearly blinding light. They are only shadows in this light, and this keeps some kind of mystery in the encounters.
This film is refreshing, optimistic and the perfect counterbalancing vision as opposed to the totally urban paranoid approach of many authors, the latest book on the subject being Steven King's Dreamcatcher. Here we understand we must not be afraid of them or their coming, because, and definitely more than us, they want to know, to exchange, to build together with us rather than destroy and annihilate.

I saw it on commercial television circa 1980 in the days before video stores and cable TV.  The movie was slotted in a two hour block and they started the film at the ""Born to be Wild"" opening credits segment.  When I saw it on video a few years later I was shocked that Fonda and Hopper made a drug deal prior to their trek to Mardi Gras.  There were other excisions, usually relating to drug use.  Why is this an important film?  Our heroes(?) aren't exactly noble individuals.  There is no real discernible plot.  The direction is haphazard at best(legend has it that director Dennis Hopper was probably stoned to the gills while making this film).  Well, this holds up as a picture of America at a time when social mores were changing.  The cinematography is beautiful.  Most impotantly, this film heralded the entrance of a new force in films, Jack Nicholson.  When Jack comes into the picture as the alcoholic ACLU lawyer the screen just lights up and maintains this aura in every scene he's in.  The scene where he smokes pot and explains the Venutian plot is classic.  The energy of this film deflates once he departs from the film.  I wonder though what relevance this picture has to a more youthful audience whose reference point to Jack is ""The Joker"".  To a younger audience Vietnam and the civil rights movement are things that may or may not have been taught in civics class.

The title of this movie is actually one of the classifications used to classify the reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).  A six-fold classification was developed in the late 1950s:

(1) Nocturnal lights: bright lights seen at night.
(2) Daylight disks: usually oval or disk-like.
(3) Radar visual: visual sightings detected by radar.
(4) Close encounters of the first kind: visual sightings of an UFO.
(5) Close encounters of the second kind:  visual sightings plus physical effects on animate or inanimate objects.
(6) ** Close encounters of the third kind: sightings of occupants in or around the UFO.

There is also another category not on this list:

Close encounters of the fourth kind: actual physical contact with the occupants of UFOs is made.

The movie was written and directed by Steven Spielberg.  He explains his movie:

""I wanted to make a very accessible story about the everyday individual who has a sighting that overturns his life and throws it into complete upheaval as he starts to become more and more obsessed with his experience.""

This movie focuses on three main characters:

(1) Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss):  He is an everyday kind of guy that has a materialistic wife (Teri Garr) and three children.  He has an experience that makes him obsessed with aliens.  (This is the person Spielberg is talking about above.)

(2) Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon, who earned a supporting actress nomination):  She is a single mother whose young son, Barry (Cary Guffey), was abducted by an alien spacecraft.  She thus also becomes obsessed with aliens.

(3) Claude Lacombe (played by the great French moviemaker Francois Truffaut):  This character is based on a real-life UFO expert.  Lacombe is a U.N. scientist who is in-charge of a mostly American team investigating unexplained phenomenon on Earth.

All three of these characters meet and experience (with others) an extraordinary event--First Contact.

Note that this movie, as can be deduced from its title, focuses on an encounter of the third kind but encounters of other kinds do occur in this movie.

In my opinion, of all the actors, Richard Dreyfuss as the obsessed Roy Neary does an excellent job.

The genius of this movie is that we don't find out until the end whether the aliens are hostile or not.

The special effects are remarkable for the time especially at the end.  Actually much of this movie does not have major special effects until its end where the fantastic effects easily stand up to those of today.  This brings up another point: this is an intelligent sci-fi movie where the special effects have a purpose and are not simply used for display.

The background music is especially good.  It garnered an Academy Award nomination.

This movie in total had eight Academy Award nominations and one win for Best Cinematography.

The only problem I had with the story is that it seems to drag a bit during its middle scenes.

Finally, the DVD (collector's edition) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has a few extras, all of which are interesting.

In conclusion, if you want to see what it feels like to experience First Contact, then I strongly recommend viewing this captivating movie!!!

1019,19,1603,"After years of owning the book, I finally got around to reading it a year or two ago.  Besides this particular adaptation, I've seen 6 others: '11 movie, '06 mini, '96 movie, '83 mini,'73 mini, and '44 movie.
While I believe the story line (500+ page novel) is better suited to a mini series length; I quite enjoyed the latest ('11) movie- despite its being only 2 hrs. long!

As for this particular one:

Don't be fooled by its title, this production is far removed from the book (so if you've never read it, and are seeking an authentic adaptation-- look elsewhere)! The only things that the two have in common are the names of its characters, and a few sequence of events! 95% of the dialogue has been rewritten (and butchered), and some events made up!

Rochester is an insufferable, maniacal, beast of a man!  With a constant scowl on his face, and a snappish bark of a tone.
How Jane could have felt anything beyond oppression and disdain is beyond me! Jane's character is even altered; she's borderline bratty, somewhat mouthy, and unreservedly opinionated.
Beyond any and all comprehension she actually loves Rochester (despite his blatant mistreatment of her- especially when she's about to leave)!!
..Thankfully it was only 108 minutes long-- anything beyond that would have been torture!
_________

If you're entirely new to this story, please get acquainted with the book before or after viewing! If you're not a fan of reading (or listening to an audio book), and you'd rather watch an adaptation- I recommend looking into the 1973 or 1983 BBC miniseries. While these earlier productions are a bit dated and theatrical/stagey, they are the most faithful to the book.  As for the latest mini series, the only real advantage it has compared to the '73 & '83 renditions, is that it has the modern cinematic feel/experience (meaning the acting & sets aren't as stiff and theatrical). In my opinion however, it's the weakest adaptation to date.  The dialogue is more modernized, certain events unfaithfully re-written, and the relationship between Rochester & Jane overly romanticized (when compared to the book).
If time is a factor, the movie I recommend is the '11 (although be advised it begins at chapter 28 in the book, and then goes back to Jane's beginning).  There are a couple of deleted scenes that add more background to the story, so you may want to check them out.",movies
1020,20,7586,"Joey Evans (Frank Sinatra) is a two-bit night club singer, womanizer, and cad.  He lands in a San Francisco saloon and starts romancing a wealthy older woman (Rita Hayworth) and sweet chorus girl (Kim Novak).

When I saw this movie in 1957 I fell head over heels for Frank and the sophisticated night club scene, but now Frank's Joey seems like a heartless sleaze, the clubs are cheap, and the movie is hopelessly dated.  It was made at the height of Frank's ring-a-ding-ding movie popularity, though, and he still charms despite playing a mean-spirited and selfish loser who is outweighed by both of his co-stars.  Poor Rita looks drab and tired, a far cry from her earlier glory days.  Kim is lovely (without those thick eyebrows from ""Vertigo""), but her singing voice is a disaster and she isn't much of a dancer.  A beatnik-style dance featuring both ladies is just embarrassing.

On the plus side, the songs are terrific.  The show is filled with memorable Rodgers and Hart tunes such as ""The Lady is a Tramp,"" ""Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered,"" ""I Could Write a Book,"" ""There's a Small Hotel,"" and ""My Funny Valentine.""

The movie is glossy and pretty with lavish gowns and furs and picturesque San Francisco as a location, but is definitely a product of its time.  What was once ultra-cool and sophisticated now seems tawdry and pathetic.  Good songs, though.",movies

however the plot is not particularly interesting. As so many people get slaughtered during the first 20 minutes, we the

viewers do not really care anymore about a little girl getting saved or not. Milla Jovovitch's stunt fights are surreal and her battle with Nemesis, clearly a distant relative of an Uruk-Hai from Lord of the rings, looks silly. I think this movie is unlucky that the crowd's appetite for zombie movies is starting to temper a little. We now want a reasonable story as well.

The fact is that ""Steel Magnolias"" is a very good, nice film. Have we seen it before?. Yes. ""Terms Of Endearment"", a better movie, comes immediatley to mind. This movie works because of the cast : Sally Field, Julia Roberts, Daryl Hannah, Shirley MacLaine, Dolly Parton, Olympia Dukakis, Tom Skerritt, and Dylan McDermott. These people give some of the best performances of their careers. The plot centers around a group of southern women who share each other's business while going to a local beauty shop. Another storyline includes Sally Fields' daughter(Roberts)getting married. If you haven't seen this movie, then that's all I'll say. Field gives a great performance. Her outburst scene towards the end is a real stand out. However, MacLaine steals every frame she's in as a sharp tongued southerner. Julia Roberts shines here too.

1025,25,4457,"I love Michelle Pfeiffer and she was amazing in this movie, but this movie could have been so much better.
The story was slow and boring, and very sad from beginning to end.

Beth has three small children.
Her three year old son (her middle child) is kidnapped.
She can't handle the loss and can't move on.
She neglects the two children that she still has.
Her marriage suffers.

I could feel Beth's pain at the loss of her child, but I felt more of her guilt over him being kidnapped right under her nose (which really could have happened to anyone, so she was way too hard on herself).

SPOILER ALERT..

The three year old, Ben, is never found by Whoopi Goldberg and the experts who were working for years to find him.
Instead, as a twelve year old, he actually walks up to the family's door and just rings the bell.
He had no idea that this was his real family.  He was simply going door to door, looking for work mowing lawns.
This kidnapped child remained in the same neighborhood all along, and later, both the older brother and younger sister admit that they had seen him around, many times.

Absolutely every character in this movie is miserable.
The irony is that Ben was the only character who was happy, that is, until his real family wants to take him back and away from the only life that he knows, and then, Ben becomes just as miserable as everyone else.

Ben was kidnapped by a woman who was an old acquaintance of Beth's, a woman who was aching for the death of her own child, and so she kidnapped Ben to replace her own three year old boy.
The woman died, and so Ben was raised by the woman's second husband, who had no idea that Ben was not his wife's biological child.
This stepfather described Ben as the happiest child that he had ever known, until it came out that he had been kidnapped, and then he became the saddest child that he had ever known.
For me, the most heartbreaking part of this movie was when the stepfather said this.

Ben is reunited with his real family, but everyone stays miserable.
Beth is thrilled to get her son back, but her joy does not last when she realizes that her son does not remember her and does not accept her.
The real father is relieved to have his son back, but he is also hurting and angry that Ben feels like the stepfather is his real father.
The older brother never wanted Ben back and has a lot of his own guilt and resentments toward Ben.
The little sister was only a baby when Ben was kidnapped, and so she is still too young to really understand what has been going on.

At the end, the family must admit that Ben needs to be with the stepfather, and they reluctantly send him back.
So, this movie begins with the sadness of the kidnapping and remains sad all the way through to the end.",movies

1030,30,5605,"I know few films in which the main character lives in a bigger contradiction. ""Taxi Driver"" depicts Travis Bickle, a man who desperately wants to wipe out everyone around him as much as he wants to embrace them. The action takes place in the New York suburbs and is somewhat of an exercise in style that works just right from beginning to end.

Hollywood has a history of interesting director-actor relationships of which the Scorsese/De Niro association is perhaps one of the most remarkable, starting with ""Mean Streets"", having its climax precisely with ""Taxi Driver"" only three years later and going on through ""Raging Bull"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Cape Fear"" and ""Casino"". Looking at these titles, you get my point when I say it is a remarkable association, don't you?

""Taxi Driver"" is arguably the pinnacle in Scorsese's career, too. It's hard to make such claim for such a talented and fruitful director, but this movie is that good. It works on so many levels and is so real and down to earth that every bit of action strikes you really hard and a lot of it you can actually relate to.

1034,34,1454,"""I thought you lived on the edge Mrs. Peel. Is this as fast as you can go?""

I much preferred this movie to most of the James Bond movies. For one, the wit is wicked, Uma Thurman (Mrs. Peel) was born to wear a catsuit and Ralph Fiennes is a most dapper John Steed. This movie has style, yet the backdrop is a special effects surreal dream. If you love storms moving in on a beach, rainy days or just gothic style weather, this is for you.

While drinking tea most often, these two secret agents fight crime in style while resisting the impulse to drown in more than a hands-off sexual chemistry. I could watch these two play mind games for hours. In one scene John Steed is discussing Dr. Emma Peel's profile and states:

""After all, according to your file you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia, based on traumatic oppression leading to outbursts of antisocial and violent behavior.""

Then, he states that she is just his style. Of course, she is not the type of woman he needs to save from herself or anyone else for that fact and more than likely he is describing the other Mrs. Peel who seems much more violent. This Mrs. Peel can take care of herself, thank you very much.

So, what is the diabolic plan they must thwart?  Ah, yes....the evil aristocrat, Sir August DeWynter. He plans to threaten the world with his fantastic high-tech weather machine. He is capable of threatening mankind with raging ice storms, scorching temperatures and mechanical insects. The special effects in regards to the weather are seamless and spectacular.

The script is delicious, the chemistry drips over the edge of the mind into a pool of absolute surging tension and visually, The Avengers is very compelling. You will love the fencing scenes, intelligent script, British humor and tongue in cheek capers.

1038,38,2988,"My whole life (I'm over 50) I've read about how great this movie was supposed to be. I never really thought about it till after I watched this but not once in my lifetime had I ever actually heard somebody I know say they liked this movie. Now I know why.

I already know what all the fans of the movie would say to me. How they don't even want to waste their breath on somebody as ignorant as me or I had to be alive during the times. Well that argument isn't going to hold any water with me. I admit my favorite genre is science fiction but one of my favorite genre's is also drive-in movies of the 50's, 60's and 70's to which this movie belongs along with many Roger Corman movies.  I don't know how much I can say that hasn't already been said both by lovers of the movie and critics. I don't know what the movie critics were thinking. There is no way that today a movie like this would garner positive reviews. Not with the internet being what it is. I suppose many movie critics of the time were part of the hippie generation and were liberal minded. Even so, I don't know how you can possibly think this was a good movie.

After the first 5 minutes it was all downhill from there. There is nothing exceptional about this movie. I've seen much better biker movies or better movies of any genre you want to classify this as. The direction is poor. There is a reason nobody would give Dennis Hopper a job for a long time after this. His next movie was a bomb and I think Hollywood realized he just go lucky with the reviews. The editing is poor also. There are several inconsisticies. The acting is well below average also. Not to mention the 'locals' they used didn't help matters. While I was watching it I said to myself ""I'll bet they just used local people, these people can't act"" and sure enough I learned that's exactly what they did. It ends terribly and I learned nothing other than the hippie movement was a waste of time. There is nothing in this movie that stands the test of time. It appears to be a movie about a bunch of losers who did nothing with their lives. I don't want to make this sound like a political discussion but what good is all this 'freedom' they talk about so for you if you do nothing with it other than to live like an animal. Then again I don't spend my life smoking weed either so I guess I'll never understand.

The movie is boring, poorly acted, poorly directed, poorly edited, plot starts OK and slowly goes nowhere. In a way it reminded me of 'The Incredible Shrinking Man.' Eventually the main protagonist shrinks to nothingness. Same as this movie.

Unless they find all that lost footage and make this into a better movie, I will never watch it again and consider it a lesson learned. I have no idea what the AFI was thinking when they included this in their 100 greatest movies.

This opinion is not coming from the younger generation who just want to see action. I actually like slow movies, independent movies....low budget movies in particular. But this one is just ridiculous. I'll admit that movies sometimes seem worse when you have expectations (opposite is true too) but this one is just flat out ridiculously boring and it teaches you nothing despite it's pretentiousness. Just look at Dennis Hopper. Typical from the generation and he is just a burn out. Listen to the commentary on the additional making of feature. They talk about him ranting and raving about the government and how they knew what they were doing when making the movie. He sounds like a raving idiot.

The only good thing that came out of this was that Jack Nicholson got himself recognized. The only decent actor in the movie.

I couldn't be more disappointed when watching a movie.

Recommended for people who just have to see every movie on AFI's 100 greatest films. There is no other reason to watch this other than to use this movie as an example of the saying, ""opinion's are like ........ everybody has one.""",movies

1059,59,6558,"It's about never giving up hope.

The 1978 film ""MIDNIGHT EXPRESS"" was a film that was known for its controversial story but also seen as a film masterpiece as it was the first major film to depict foreigners inhumane treatment in prison and it was brought alive due to the awesome performance by actor Brad Davis (""Chariots of Fire"", ""Roots"") and a film directed by Alan Parker (""Bugsy Malone"", ""Pink Floyd the Wall"", ""Fame"", ""Evita"" and ""Angela's Ashes"") and a screenplay by Oliver Stone (""Platoon"", ""JFK"", ""Natural Born Killers"", ""The Doors"" and ""Alexander"").  The film would also feature the talents of composer Giorgio Moroder (""Flashdance"", ""Scarface"" and ""Over the Top"") and cinematography by Michael Seresin (""Fame"", ""Angela's Ashes"", ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""Step Up"").

""MIDNIGHT EXPRESS"" would be nominated for seven Academy Awards and won an Academy Award for ""Best Music"", ""Original Score"", ""Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium"".

But what caught attention was that the film was based on a true story of Billy Hayes who was convicted for smuggling hash and sentenced to four years in a Turk prison where he and many people were tortured.  To make matters worse, he became a scapegoat to prevent foreigners from even thinking of smuggling drugs in the country by having his sentenced overturned and giving him a life sentence.

Hayes book ""Midnight Express"" details his life behind bars and the inhumane treatment that he and others received in prison and eventually how he escaped from the prison.  The film adaption had gone through so many hands through its screenplay adaption and studio pressure that in order to make it a commercial film and due to budget constraints and location challenges, there is a difference between the book and the actual film.

But despite the controversy (which Oliver Stone and even the real Billy Hayes have regretted the film's depiction of the Turks), the film was well-known for its powerful performances and its powerful storyline.  It's a gritty film that shows the violence behind Hayes experiences at the prison and torture they received.  Including other things that were deemed quite controversial back in the late 70's.

It is important to note that this film is featured in Digibook format (a book format and not the standard blue blu-ray case) as it contains a 42-page booklet with Director Alan Parker writing a personal memoir titled ""Anatomy of a Film: The Making of Midnight Express"" is included.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""MIDNIGHT EXPRESS"" received its 30th Anniversary treatment back in 2008 and in 2009, gets its High Definition treatment as the film is presented in 1080p High Definition (aspect ratio of 1:85:1).

The film looks incredible on Blu-ray and also compared to its DVD counterpart, the film really shows off the detail and grittiness of the prison and also how bad the conditions were (note: this is one of the controversies as the actual prison was supposedly created in the 1960's but the film makes the prison look like the prison was created many decades before).  But the picture quality captures the grittiness of the prisoners and the overall look, is not exactly vibrant but quite detailed.

The film looks as if there was little DNR (digital noise reduction) was used and overall, you can see grain on the film.  Overall, this is a superb transfer to Blu-ray and another classic film given awesome treatment from Sony.

As for the audio, the film is presented in English, French and Portuguese Dolby TrueHD 5.1. (Also in Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and the original English mono soundtrack).  For the most part, the film is front channel heavy as it is dialog-driven.  Although there are action sequences, they are very few and if anything comes alive is the music by Giorgio Moroder.

Overall, its great to see the film receive a lossless soundtrack and also include the original mono soundtrack as well.  But you are able to hear the screams of the prisoners while being tortured and overall, the pain and anguish from the talents who just are trying to keep sane in the prison.

As for subtitles, subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""MIDNIGHT EXPRESS"" comes with several special features featured in High Definition and Standard Definition in English (Stereo) and Portuguese and Spanish subtitles.  The Blu-ray is BD-Live enabled.

  * ""Anatomy of a Film: The Making of Midnight Express"" by Director Alan Parker - As mentioned, the release is featured in digibook format and includes a 42-page booklet/personal memoir titled ""Anatomy of a Film: The Making of Midnight Express"" by Director Alan Parker.  This book is quite thorough in the challenges the film had and also, how Brad Davis was a method actor and in essence became Billy Hayes.  Also, how warden Hamidou (Paul L. Smith) was also a bit rough on the actors during the torture scenes to the dismay of the actors who were to pretend as if they were being beaten (and too get that realism, Smith didn't hold back).  Also, how John Hurt (who played Max) didn't shower for six weeks in order to make his scene seem real and natural.  The personal memoir is quite detailed and those who enjoyed the film will enjoy reading this book filled with photos and storyboard sketches.
  * Commentary with Director Alan Parker - If you thought the booklet was full of detail, Director Alan Parker really goes into detail of each scene and what transpired behind-the-scenes of the making of ""MIDNIGHT EXPRESS"".
  * The Making of Midnight Express (7:27) The original 1978 featurette with an interview with the real Billy Hayes.
  * The Producers - (25:54) Peter Guber (Executive Producer), Producer David Puttnam and Director Alan Parker discuss the challenge of making the film and the changes that had to be made for the film.
  * The Production - (24:27) Interviews with Director Alan Parker, Producer Alan Marshall and Billy Hayes.  Continuing discussion of the challenges of making the film, which included the studio execs not thrilled of the producers selecting Brad Davis (Richard Gere pulled out of the film) and tried to say he was cross-eyed and thus the producers having to get a medical note that he wasn't cross-eyed and challenges of finding the location and the differences that went into making the film from the original screenplay.
  * The Finished Film - (23:49) Discussion of how hardcore of a method actor Brad Davis was and how far Alan Parker pushed him to achieve that powerful performance of Billy Hayes.  Also, discussing how the film is based on a true story but is not the true story.  And how there are key differences between the film and the book. Featuring interviews with Director Alan Parker and Oliver Stone.
  * Photo Gallery - (12:35) A photo gallery which is accompanied by music from the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""MIDNIGHT EXPRESS"" is a powerful film about survival and despite how far low one can be in a situation, the human will to live and survive can lead to amazing wonders.  As it has had in the real life situation for Billy Hayes who had one of the most impressive prison escapes.

If there was any negative of the film, it's that the real story of Billy Hayes and his life in prison has been changed for the film adaption.  In fact, Billy Hayes has commented in regards to the film that he wished there were more positive portrayals of the Turks and even Oliver Stone has come out and talked about their wish that the film had shown a positive life on some Turks and that not all Turks are bad.

But also, the actual escape of Billy Hayes differs greatly from the film adaption.  But considering that there was another planned final for the film that would have been a bit unbelievable, I was content with how the film ended.

The film is ultimately a powerful film and the acting is top notch and Brad Davis just shined in this film.  He was incredible playing the part of Billy Hayes and it was a role that consumed him even when near the end of the filming of ""MIDNIGHT EXPRESS"".  But his performance made ""MIDNIGHT EXPRESS"" so believable in that despite what he did to receive prison time, we sympathize with him when he is tortured and is told that his four year sentence has been overturned and he would be getting a life sentence.

It was indeed a powerful performance and a powerful film experience that is so visually disturbing and that Director Alan Parker and crew were able to capture the anguish, the anger, the pain and grittiness of the film was amazing.

Overall, ""MIDNIGHT EXPRESS"" is an amazing film and worthy of having in your collection.  But I can understand if the film may be a bit much for some to watch it for a second time or more.

But for those who did enjoy the film, this Blu-ray release of ""MIDNIGHT EXPRESS"" is the definitive version to own!",movies

1061,61,7385,"The Messenger is a very thought-provoking film. I was very surprised to see a movie in-which Joan of Arc is portrayed to be very erratic, obsessed...perhaps, even schizophrenic. However, her behavior makes you wonder. Where does inspiration come from? If you hear voices, are they good ones? If you think you hear the voice of God...is it God, or your own Ego? Watch this movie and contemplate the deeper meaning of who you are and why you do the things you do. The sets are wonderful and the message is power-packed. I truly loved the characters, even if I was a little surprised.  Some of the supporting characters are just as interesting as the main characters--but, I don't want to ruin the moments! The Battle scenes are terrific, they make you want to grab a sword and go fight for a cause.  This movie does an excellent job of revealing the Patriarchal Dictatorship of the church, as well. You will wish you could walk into the movie and knock a few heads together, then give a lecture about proper behavior amongst ""men of God.""

1066,66,1663,"This is another version of Jane Eyre that I love! This Mr. Edward R., scared me ,at first, with his rough and loud manner, but I started seeing his gentle heart, that he keeps hidden, along with painful, lonely, heartbreaking, secrets of no hope!

  Jane and Edward have a lot in common, and yet they are so different! Jane helps heal, Edward's broken, empty heart, and Edward is the first man that ever loved Jane, she has always been so alone, it did not take him long to see how special Jane, really was!

 In the movie I loved the talk that Edward gives Jane, about Adele's mother, by the lake. And I love the part where Edward asks Jane about, why she did not write him a letter, while she was gone. And I loved the part where Edward asked Jane to watch the sunrise with him! I highly recommend this movie, I liked this version of Jane Eyre very much! I loved the intense, all consuming emotions, of this Mr. Edward R.!

 But the most compelling, heartfelt scene was when Edward ,who was now, a scarred and broken man, with tears rolling down his face, with still so much love for Jane, while Jane helded him in her arms! It makes you wonder how it would feel, to be loved that way! I so love happy endings, and Jane and Edward finally had one!",movies

1070,70,7232,"Resident Evil undoubtedly works far better on the small screen than it did at the cinema. There is no way any director (no matter how experienced) can bring a video game to life without sacrificing art in the process. Anderson has been here before with Mortal Kombat but injected into both movies enough competency and style to make them respectable in their own right.
With Resident Evil he has given us a decent story with a touch of complication and a fair amount of suspense. My main gripe is the fact that the movie looks far too slick to be as truly disturbing as the grainy and filthy Zombie movies of the '70s. Plus the violence isn't all that graphic but there is still plenty of fun to be had in watching a bunch of office workers turn into the living dead and it's scary how cheaply their lives are considered by the Umbrella Corp. they work for. I'm certainly not going to work in an office for a company like that if that's what they're going to do to me.
The characters are thin but not entirely one-dimensional. You do end up siding with some of them and feel urgency in their futile escape from the underground skyscraper (shouldn't that be 'Groundscraper' then?). Milla Jovovich is cuter here than she was in Fifth Element or Zoolander but Michelle Rodriguez just plain annoys me. All I've ever seen her play is a moody Latino who frowns all the time. It's time for here to try and expand her range a bit and I wish someone else played her character.
Video games will never make for classic movies. They can be mind-numbingly terrible (Super Mario Brothers, Double Dragon) or competent, such as this. Just turn a blind eye to the really, really bad FX at the end when a CGI monster goes on the rampage. My old Commodore 64 was capable of better graphics.
The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen and a choice of Dolby 5.1 or DTS 5.1 soundtracks which sound great but, as a result, also serve to highlight he meaningless and clichd Marco Beltrami/Marylin Manson 'score'.",movies
1071,71,7671,"To my surprise, Resident Evil was a excellent movie.  I really did enjoy Anderson's, ""Mortal Kombat"" so it was no surprise that I would enjoy this movie.  Don't get me wrong though, because I did have my doubts about this movie.  Most video game movies tend to flop for example, Street Fighter and Super Mario Brothers.  Don't get Paul Anderson confused with Mortal Kombat Annihilation because he had nothing to do with that HORRIBLE movie.

The movie actually takes place one month prior to the Playstation Game Resident Evil and ends at some point within Resident Evil 2 and 3.  How?  I will explain later in the review.  The only think I disliked about the movie was the mansion set used in the movie itself.  It looked nothing like the Mansion used in PSOne Resident Evil.  The interior of the mansion followed the style of PSOne Resident Evil, but many hardcore gamers will immediately point out that the Mansion is completely different on the outside.  Every thing else follows close the game format and can possibly be tied into the game.

Many people will immediately identify Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriquez in the movie.  Other actors are no names, but one actor named Eric Mabius is one to keep a eye on.  The movie is centered around a huge underground laboratory under Raccoon City called the Hive which is owned and operated by the Umbrella Corporation.  A virus is unleashed by a insider within the Hive and you know what comes next...Zombies Galore!  If you remember the games, Umbrella is known for one thing, cover ups and they attempt to cover up this mess by completely sealing the Hive off with everyone trapped inside.  A special ops team is dispatched to clean up the mess by making sure if this leaks to the public, Umbrella will not be blamed.  Milla is dragged into the mess not knowing that she also works for Umbrella.  When the team fails to accomplish thier mission, their new mission is to get out of the Hive ALIVE!  Get ready for some excellent nail biting suspense and action as they attempt to get out of the Hive.

It has been announced that a Resident Evil 2 is in the works already and will star Milla Jovovich and Eric Mabius who will play the ""Nemesis"".  Resident Evil ends somewhere within PS1 Resident Evil 2 and 3.  You have to remember that in the PS1 Resident 3, PS1 Resident Evil 2 took place when Jill Valentine was injurned and poisened by the Nemesis.  Two other characters from the game will be showing up in Resident Evil 2.  Gina Phillips will be cast as Claire Redfield and Natasha Henstridge will be cast as Jill Valentine.  This is going to be interesting to see them together on the screen when they never really met in the Playstation Game Series Resident Evil.  We know that Claire was in Raccoon City looking for her brother Chris and Jill Valentine was attempting to get out of Raccoon City Alive.  I sure can't wait to see how Paul Anderson will bring this movie together in Resident Evil 2.  If you are a fan of Resident Evil, I know you can't wait too!",movies
1072,72,937,"I have to say I had higher hopes for this video; Sesame Street has such a wonderful stable of number clips, and I was hoping to see better ones.
So, for the first time, I'm recommending the between-clip footage over the clips!  The opening song ""That's How The Numbers Go"" could easily become the numerical version of the ABC song; its jazzy and singable and goes all the way to twenty.  The setup is that Ernie stops by the Furry Arms Hotel to return a lost room key, where he shows bumbling hotel owners Humphrey and Ingrid that things (like room keys) can be organized with numbers.  I also like that this video isn't scrubbed clean of any conflict - the much-maligned bellhop, Benny the Bunny, is one of Kevin Clash's best characters, and he's terrific in this video; he and Ernie show how to return a sour face with a smile (and some innocent teasing!)
Although there is one good clip - ""Martian Beauty #9,"" unfortunately, this doesn't include some of the ingenious and artistic number clips from Sesame Street past:  no bakers falling down stairs, no pinball machine, no counting marble machines.  Instead, you get the lukewarm ""#11 rap,"" which shows pictures of 11 things, and ""Five Jive with Elmo Hammer,"" which is already on too many Sesame Street videos as it is.  Yawn.",movies

1083,83,7447,"Resident Evil is yet another movie based on a video game and I must say I don't think it was that bad. Sure the Zombies are no where as scary as the ones in Romero's films, just seem more like people with rabies than the living dead, lol. What I was surprised about though was the acting, it wasn't all that bad. Think Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element) gives her best performance yet, Michelle Rodriguez (The Fast & the Furious) is pretty good too. Getting rid of George Romero was the biggest mistake though as I was really looking forward to a come-bat. Mean the director of Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead doing Resident Evil would of been a dream come true. Sure his scrpt that was canned was much better too.
  Well anyway despite that let down, besides the acting I also liked the action, especially the train sequence at the end. Think there's a little too much confusing in the very end though, leaves too many loose ends. For instance there's a certain character whose fate really isn't clear and who you don't see again, guess they're planning a sequel. As long as they have a better script, scarier zombies and the sexy  Milla Jovovich returns I'll have no problem with that.",movies

This film is NOTHING like the Broadway show, its an entirely different animal.  Aileen Quinn stars as Annie, with Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan, Bernadette Peters as Lily St Regis, Ann Reinking as Grace Farrell, Albert Finney as Warbucks and Tim Curry as Rooster.
The director, John Huston, has turned the show into a huge, bellowing blockbuster, with huge fanfares and leaping dancers. The show is really a simple tale of a girl in search of her parents, and who finds a home in the arms of a millionaire.
The climax, with Annie dangling over a bridge thing, is completely unrealistic.

I think Ralph Fiennes is a fine actor and whats more I'm Scottish and as is the custom if you're Scottish, I'm one of Sir Sean Connery's greatest fans. He was the best Bond (although Pierce Brosnan's doing a fine job) and great in movies such as The Hill, The Untouchables (even if the accent was a bit ropey), The Hunt For Red October, The Rock, Outland etc. He is a fine ambassador for his nation and the world's greatest living Scotsman by popular acclaim BUT what were you thinking Sir Sean when you made this pile of poo? Didn't you read the script? Or were you too busy banking the cheque?
This movie stinks. Not because a remake of the sixties TV series was a bad idea because it wasn't. Not because the movie didn't have potential because it did. Not because the series had a cult following and the movie had a ready made audience to tap into. No it stinks because it boasts one of the worst scripts ever, with plot-holes you could drive a car through, poor editing, poor special effects, a really (...) supporting performance from Eddie Izzard and perhaps the worst choreographed and directed action scenes you could ever see. Take a bow Mr Jeremiah Chechick (also director of the fine Benny and Joon and the awful National Lampoons Christmas Vacation). The movie also boasts a fine English accent from Uma Thurman but a truly awful acting display not just from her but an incredibly wooden and uncharismatic performance from Ralph Fiennes.
This movie was so bad that Warner Bros. wouldn't even let the critics see it prior to it's theatrical release but word of mouth soon spread about how bad it was and it sunk like a stone anyway. According to Total Film Magazine the movie was originally two and a half hours long and was hacked down to a mere 89 minutes for its theatrical release after a disastrous test screening, thus making Don MacPherson's screenplay (supposedly based on Shakespeares The Tempest) make even less sense. Voted the second worst blockbuster ever made by readers of the UK's Total Film magazine, this movie didn't help anybody's career but particularly harmed Uma Thurman whose previous outing had been the sequally awful Batman and Robin.

1110,110,5328,"Don't get me wrong -- I LOVE the film. It's a classic of the mid-1970s and defined (and capped off) the era of the independent spirit of Hollywood (captured in Peter Biskind's book, EASY RIDERS, RAGING BULLS. Scorsese, Coppola, Bogdanovich, Spielberg, Lukas, Rafaelson, Hal Ashby, Warren Beatty, and even Jack Nicholson brought a European sensibility to Hollywood during the late 60s and early 70s. In some ways, TAXI DRIVER (1976) represented the end of that era, even as JAWS (released the year before) signaled the new direction Hollywood would go in -- and still goes in -- to the great detriment of American film. Thank goodness for the Indies!

My problem with this disk is that, in order to fit the 4K transfer on it, they had to drop all the extras that appear on the ""standard"" blu-ray of the film. I don't have a 4K television, and I imagine you would only see the difference on a VERY large television or in a theater auditorium. I'd rather have the extras -- even though I'm a perfectionist when it comes to picture and sound. Get the 4K if you have a 4K television and it really makes a difference to you. The extras are pretty good and I'm glad I returned this disk and got the other one (with an almost identical cover).",movies

1113,113,6723,"Ravenous zombies - what more could you ask for on Halloween?  RESIDENT EVIL is chock full of monsters, blood, gore, and actually cool, creative decapitations.  Based on a popular computer game (which I have never played), RESIDENT EVIL is an entertaining monster flick for a cozy evening at home.

RESIDENT EVIL opens with a bang:  something has gone seriously wrong in a secret, underground research facility.  (Isn't that always the case?)  Red Queen, the computer that runs the complex, has gone mad, killing everyone in the place, and initiating a complete lock-down of the facility.  The only people on the outside who might know what is going on have no memory.  A crack military team is sent in to determine what happened.  But things go horribly wrong...

As zombie movies go, RESIDENT EVIL is pretty fun.  It launches the viewer on a wild ride, rarely pausing for breath.  The special effects are pretty well done, and as stated earlier, there are some pretty original decapitations using lasers.  The plot is pretty loose and full of holes, but I really didn't care; I was having too much fun.  The acting is typical for a monster flick, but then again, you don't watch a monster movie for the acting.

If you enjoy this sort of thing, you will really like RESIDENT EVIL.  My husband and I did, and it was just the thing for Halloween.  But seriously, couldn't the Umbrella Corporation, who owns the research facility, see this coming?  I mean, they named their master computer Red Queen.  It was in the cards.  Eventually, the Red Queen was obviously going to say ""Off with their heads!""",movies

1116,116,1833,"It is no exaggeration to say that this classic early 70's British period drama is one of the all-time best series of its sort ever produced.  With sixty-eight 50-minute episodes, the series covers a time span of nearly 30 years (from early Edwardian England in 1903, through the horrors of the First World War, and on into the Roaring 20s, finally concluding with 1929's stock market crash). The setting is the household of the Bellamy family at 165 Eaton Place, London.  Upstairs live Richard Bellamy, MP, and his beautiful, aristocratic wife, Lady Margery. The Bellamys have two adult children, Captain James and Elizabeth, who come and go much like a recurring motif (though recurring nightmare might be more appropriate, for they are the source of much grief (albeit unintended) for their society parents). I don't wish to give the storylines, scandals and surprises away. Suffice it to say that as the series progress, there are lovers, marriages, births and deaths (not to mention the arrival of a beautiful young niece) which impact on the relationships and alter the composition of the group above stairs.

Downstairs we are privy to the lives of the servants in the Bellamy household. First and foremost is the devout, inflexible and regimental head butler, Angus Hudson, the staff overlord. Then there is the curmudgeonly but good-hearted cook, Mrs. Bridges. Other memorable characters include the efficient but sheltered head house/parlour maid, Rose Buck; the religious but simple footman, Alfred; his successor, the good-natured Edward, who has an eye for the female staff; the not-overly-bright scullery maid, Emily, and her successor and intellectual equal, Ruby; and Lady Margery's prim and snobbish lady's maid, Miss Roberts.  Of course, one simply cannot forget the sassy, vivacious new under house/parlour maid, Sarah (Pauline Collins), who is a real dreamer and schemer and who, like a bad penny, turns up on the Bellamys' doorstep periodically during the first two series, or the new capable-but-just-as-conniving chauffeur, Thomas (Collins' real-life husband, John Alderton), who is nobody's fool!  Like the family upstairs, the downstairs ""family"" too has its share of comings and goings, what with lovers, marriages, deaths, hirings, and firings.

This boxed set includes the 1979 spin-off series entitled Thomas and Sarah (thirteen 50-minute episodes), which chronicles the adventures and misadventures of those two memorable miscreants after they leave the Bellamy's employ.  Unlike Upstairs Downstairs, which is fairly high drama infused with a spattering comic relief here and there, Thomas and Sarah is very much a comedy-drama.  With Sarah's penchant for foreign accents and tale-telling and the conniving and entrepreneurial spirit that both characters embody, the stage is set for some thoroughly enjoyable vignettes. Most of the episodes involve the couple trying their hands (and luck) at something new--like running a match-making agency, working in a boys' school, working as magicians, and so on.  For all their efforts, however, they always seem to find themselves skint--and thus the need for another enterprise (and hence another enjoyable episode!).  The only thing less than satisfactory is the ""conclusion"" of the final episode, which left me wondering whether or not a second series was at least anticipated.  But that's is a minor quibble, for this is a series to be watched for the sheer enjoyment of the journey.

One final dvd bonus is the enjoyable and informative 50-minute 25th Anniversary Special,  which was produced around 1998 and includes remembrances by many of the surviving actors (including James, Elizabeth, Rose, Edward, Daisy, and Ruby).

In conclusion, Upstairs Downstairs is quite simply an outstanding dramatic series.  It is compelling, captivating, and often thought-provoking; and if you enjoy a dramatic series with lots of ""goings on,"" scandal, and so forth, you'll enjoy it all the more!  The inclusion of Thomas and Sarah is a delightful, light-hearted, entertaining bonus, and I highly, HIGHLY recommend this boxed set to all fans of the very best in British period drama.",movies

1126,126,5592,"Everyone's favorite disturbed sentimental favorite cabbie drives on. Even after 30 years, Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" still hits a familiar nerve with it's audience whether new or old. As Travis Bickell, Robert DeNiro plays one of his most well-known roles. His anguish and disgust for all things wrong are intensified with his job and living situation. As a cab driver in a city (NYC) that has it's fair of poverty, crime, and unsanitary conditions, Travis becomes an inevitable time-bomb ready to blow up.

There is more to Travis though as he does recognize his surroundings and assumes a self role as an important person in the solution of what aches him. His target is a popular political
candidate. His journey though is side tracked by a lovely
distraction (Cybil Sheppard). At the same time Travis monitors the actions of a very young prostitute (Jody Foster) to ""free"" her of the madness around her. So, what we actually have is a
multi-tasking emotionally disturbed individual in a collision course with history.

What many viewer see themselves in Travis is his disgust for
things in need of repair/disposal. His intentions and actions were extreme though, but his aim was arguably true. Another 30
years or so and Travis' story will still matter.",movies

1136,136,7326,"Not only is Joan of Arc presented as a nut in this film, she's clearly tripping on speed: Jumping out of her skin, screaming her head off and delivering banal lines with halting, eye-bugging intensity.
It's hard to believe that even the most religiously medieval French soldier would give this loon the time of day, let alone follow her into battle.
Mon Dieu! Run awaaaaaayy. . .
But I'll say this for the director, he's consistent. It's fast paced all the way through, what with boulders a la 'Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom ' getting hurled at the troops along with other JamesBondian gizmos making for cool technogore.
 Which, alongside Joan's motivation in this script ( Her sister's been raped by the posse of --er I mean the Brits) turns it all into an enjoyable comic book Western revengefest. It's 'The Quick and the Dead' minus gunslingers, set in 1429. Plus the scenes of her schizoid 'visions' are gorgeously photographed.
But as far as the real Joan of Arc, the only major historical figure whose life and thought has come down to us through sworn court testimony---Oh well, in the first place she's had writers of genius like Shaw and Twain to  balance this dramatization, and in the second place, as long as we're making films about protagonists who hear voices, wild battle scenes and trials for heresy it could have been much worse.

1143,143,1558,"Imagine having your favorite book cast by two of your favorite actors for film. To me Hinds and Morton had exactly the right look for the characters. I've enjoyed the depth of their acting in other projects. They are both wonderfully talented. I anticipated this version with eagerness.

Alas reader,  the screenplay. What were they thinking? The spirit of the piece was way, way off in key scenes.  Jane is rolling her eyes at times and they both speak so abusively to each other for a lot of it. The first meeting was like that, very nasty to each other there.

But what really was off was Hines  yelling  all the time.  I heard his radio take on Rochester and his characterization was much calmer with more control. This Rochester is more bombastic than likeable. Seriously, I cant see what attracts Jane to him! These yelling torrents ruin key moments like that first meeting for example.  However, the stay with me scene (after the aborted wedding) was the worst. He was actually horribly bullying and abusive here. He throws things, he hurts her. He blames Jane for not excepting his view. He excuses himself with a ""What was I supposed to do, tell you the truth?"" kind of attitude. As she leaves he's calling out ""That's right leave, its just like you."" WHAT is he talking about?? Rochester is supposed to be heartbroken  NOT hateful. It was hard to watch such a total bolt away from the novel here!  And what's with all the open mouthed ""kissing"" when he proposes? (By the way, he yells here too!)

But there were scenes I really liked.  His confession of his past life to Jane is well staged and poignant. Watching the sunrise together was nice. When she just returns to Thornfield from visiting the aunt (that we never get to see-one moment she leaves the next she returns). The scenery and sets are all very pleasing. I especially loved the camera work during the party scene where Jane is remembering Blanche and Rochester singing. Bertha was a hoot. Shopping at Milcott was good, except for the insertion of Blanche there, Rochester is actually nice to Adel at times. Also, the ending, though the dialog is not exactly from the book, was extremely touching. They are both excellent in this scene. And a postscript scene with children and voice over was a nice touch. These are excellent actors. It would, I feel, been first rate to have these truly talented people in a better adaptation.",movies

1149,149,5309,"I won't deny I like my De Niro films and I have a soft spot for the edgy slightly off beat Scorsese direction that works so well. This duo partnership has been played out through the years, but this earlier film is arguably one of the best that both men have created.

Right from the first opening scene with the city smoke and taxi moving through it, the close up eye shots of De Niro then the rain beating down on the taxi's windscreen with the street lights out of focus...topped off I might add with the magnificent Bernard Herrmann soundtrack, it's probably one of the most memorable and perfectly executed openings ever on any motion picture. Of course a sizzling opening does not a good film make, but it does set the ""mood"" for what is a highly unusual and very graphic film.

Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle a recently discharged Marine who is looking for work and lives a very odd and secluded life as well as having sleep problems he's down and out but manages to find a job as a ""Taxi Driver"" The odd hours and late nights suit Travis, but he meets a local political campaign worker whom he soon becomes somewhat obsessed with (Cybill Shepherd who plays the part of Betsy)

Travis takes her on a date but his lack of social skills soon ruin the date after he takes Betsy to an adult movie playing in a local cinema. These early scenes show a lack of maturity and isolation of Travis who is detached and indifferent to normal behaviour. But deep down Travis has a sense of morality and is often sickened by what he sees on the streets, the crime and prostitution. He starts to tone himself up and vent his frustration into physical training

The story unfolds when Travis picks up an underage prostitute called ""Iris"" (Jodie Foster) trying to escape from her pimp boss ""Sport"" (Harvey Keitel), who drags her out of the cab. Travis is concerned by this and arranges to meet with Iris via the prostitution circle but instead of hiring Iris to have sex he tell her he wants to help her get out of prostitution. The later parts of the film revolve mostly around Travis and his new found mission to free Iris from her pimp and let her start a new life. But there are some very memorable moments along the way , the quick action sleeve gun design and mirror scenes, the Mohawk hair cut among many others. Also look out for a small scene where the director is paying Travis to sit in his cab and watch his wife cheating.

It would be easy to put Taxi Driver down as a fairly violent drama without much soul, but the reality is Travis despite being a bit of an oddball has a heart beneath it and his one man mission to extract punishment on the ""scum"" of the streets is a novel twist on the vigilante take. All this wouldn't work were it not for some masterful direction from Martin Scorsese, and some very convincing acting from all the cast members esp De Niro and Foster who both have difficult roles to play.

Cinematography is first class with some great scenes and angles provided by Michael Chapman, wonderful soundtrack and a genuinely meaningful storyline. De Niro provides narration in parts and this hints at the theme which Scorsese would later develop into his trade mark (narration and freeze frames) But here we have a fresh and eager crew and cast delivering up a powerful cinematic punch. The ending is quite violent, in the extra features the documentary (which is well worth a watch on it's own) explains this had to be toned down (colour and saturation wise - blood) to make the R rating, once you see the scene you'll understand why back in this time period the gore was deemed unacceptable. Don't dismiss Taxi Driver as a gore fest pure violence film, there is a serious moral side to the production and it successfully manages to convey a gloomy atmosphere and looks into the mind of a genuinely good man, who is mostly alone and struggling with life.

People band the ""timeless masterpiece"" title around a bit too much, but this is such a unique film on every level and has earned great respect among fans as a real cult classic. I remember the first time I watched this pondering just how tedious could a film be about a Taxi Driver? Well this is no ordinary cab ride a gritty street/crime drama that leaves a lasting impression on viewers.

Probably the most powerful film both men have made",movies
1150,150,4167,"""Idle Hands"" has got to be one of the best horror/comedies ever. I absolutely love this film, it is filled with so much horror and comedy that you can't really put it into just one genre. ""Idle Hands"" is basically about pot-head Anton (Devon Sawa)whose right hand gets possessed by the devil and takes him on a wild (and hilarious) killing spree. The plot is simple, but the actors are what bring the film to life. Seth Green, Devon Sawa, and Elden Henson make the perfect trio of burn-outs and are absolutely hysterical. Jack Noseworthy is also good as the Motley-Crue-loving-motor-jock. The film is excellent, but what really brings this DVD to life are the features. We get a commentary by Rodman Flender, Seth Green, and Elden Henson, which is very informative and fun to listen to. You learn a lot of facts from the commentary; like how Seth and Elden won the role of Mick and Pnub, how Devon Sawa used a real butcher-knife for the hand-chopping sequence, Rodman poitning out numerous goofs and cameos by The Offspring, Ricky Martin, and a member of Blink-182, and many other little facts. The deleted scene is actually an alternate ending, which is totally different than the theatrical ending, and there is an introduction with Rodman Flender explaining why they cut it. Even though this ending is good, I still prefer the theatrical ending. Then we get some interesting storyboard-comparisons of two scenes, which are fun to watch if you really like the film. The production notes and talent files are okay, nothing special, and the making of featurette is good, you'll also learn some interesting facts and see how they did some of the effects. Then we finish with the trailers for ""Idle Hands"" and ""Can't hardly wait"". The trailer is good, it features a few glimpses of some cut scenes, see if you can catch em'.
""Idle Hands"" is a superbly crafted film that unfortunately bombed at the box-office (though I don't see why it bombed) and in a few years will probably become a cult-classic. ""Idle Hands"" is a solid buy, the special features are great and so is the price.",movies

The scientist has promised to airlift them to safety before a nuclear bomb destroys Raccoon City.

Some people knock on this movie for lacking true horror but clearly Idle Hands was not meant to be a true horror film. If you want true horror over comedy horror, then skip on this and watch The Blair Witch Project or something.

Anton Tobias' is a slacking high school stoner who has no motivation in life and gets through his problems with the simple use of weed and a bong. When his parents end up mysteriously dead a few days before Halloween, Anton becomes the prime suspect; although he has no recollection of ever committing such a heinous act. He enlists the aid of his two equally lazy friends; Pnub and Mick to help him track down the killer, but when he ends up killing them off, Anton realizes that his right hand has become possessed by the Devil .

As multiple more killings follow; fellow high school student, Debi LeCure is on the hunt for who or what is committing the murders. Anton must then team up with his neighborhood crush across the street, Molly (the beautiful Jessica Alba) to find a way to tame his possessed hand before it kills anyone else. Will he be able to stop his evil hand? Who else will become a victim? Can Anton find the courage to ask Molly to the high school's Halloween Prom Dance?

Besson's Jeanne is  a bellowing lunatic and latter day feminist with a wicked right cross.  She  lounges in bed until midday then furiously berates her commanders for  starting the battle without her.  Similarly, her knights can be found  sleeping late (in full armour!) on the battlefield with the English Army  directly to their front.  The English in their turn are mercilessly  pilloried as a race of brutal proto nazis, well...OK. These are just a few  of the film's more besetting problems.  Besson's Jeanne comes across as not  a maid, but a madwoman worthy of institutionalization, if not the stake.
Likewise, Milla Jovovich's Jeanne is an insult to her memory.  Alternately screaming, squeaking,  pouting and hallucinating... It is  difficult to imagine teenage boys following such a girl around a swimming  pool, let alone hardened campaigners following her into battle.  One finds  one's self looking forward to her execution.

The comics that I read for Fright Night didn't meddle in worthless jokes and in general made them poignant. It wasn't just about dumb laughs for no real reason such as this turd of a movie possessed. I found William Ragsdale's performance as Charlie Brewster to be dorky! And needless to say he was alot better on Herman's Head. Chris Sarandon was not only very inconsistant in his laughable performance as vampire Jerry Dandridge but he was neither funny nor clever! To say nothing of that scene where one moment he's telling Charlie Brewster that he would give him a chance to forget all about him and what he knows then the next he's strangling him while trying to push him out the window. My gosh are they sure this is a comedy? 'Cause that was a crude moment. Anyway I liked Chris alot better in Child's Play a few years later. Amanda Bearse in a Pre-Married With Children role as Charlie's love interest was a forgivable enough performance despite her not giving it her all! Whoever that really annoying dork was that played Ed/Evil Ed he was just too unbearable and not very funny. The only thing he did that would even remotely pass as funny was his poor attempt to try and fly out a window appearing to fall. I'm sorry but there just isn't any excusing this bucket of vomit at all! Needless to say Roddy McDowell should just stick with Planet of the Apes! He just tried too hard in his half-a**ed performance as Peter Vincent. Anyhoo if you want to see a real vampire comedy I recommend you try Vampire in Brooklyn,Once Bitten, or even My Best Friend's a Vampire and stay away from this eye cancer on celluloid all together!",movies

1168,168,1984,"This is a made-for-TV movie produced by the A&E television network in 2001.  It was adapted from a novel by Howard Fast and I assume it is historically accurate.  It's about a defining moment in American history - that of George Washington crossing the Delaware River and attacking the well-trained German soldiers hired by the British, at Trenton, New Jersey.
I recently visited a friend who lives in that area and walked across the bridge where George Washington made this historic crossing.  Of course there was no bridge back in 1776 on that cold December day -- just the dark and the cold and an ice-filled river.  The Continentals, which was what the Americans were called then, were losing the war. They had not won a battle since they declared independence six months before on July 4.  The troops were weary and starving.  It looked like the American Revolution was lost.
But Washington took a huge risk, and in his own quiet and determined way, made a decision that changed the course of history.  The scenes of the actual crossing were done in fog and shadow, as the boats moved towards the opposite shore.  But there were no scenes that looked like the famous painting with Washington standing in the front of the boat.  In this film, Washington was sitting throughout. Naturally, this made me re-think my own historical perceptions.
Jeff Daniels is cast as Washington, and I found myself very critical of his performance.  He seemed aloof and wooden and, even though there was constant danger, he never lost his cool, calm leadership abilities.  I understand, though, that this is exactly the kind of person that George Washington was. If this is true, then he did portray him well.
Basically, though, even though there was some conflict between the various generals as well as a bit of bawdy language and some violent scenes of swordplay, the film never rose above that of a history lesson, one shown in classrooms or while visiting museums. I tend to like my drama more complex though, and for that reason this film, while well done, has to be viewed for what it is.  I therefore give it a modest recommendation.  It's certainly worthwhile seeing.",movies

1171,171,4266,"Steven Spielberg topped himself with this movie, which arrived two years after JAWS, the movie that blew the movie industry -- and the rest of us -- away.  The first movie to explore aliens from the vantage point of someone  who could be your neighbor, or YOU, is fascinating and utlimately  surprisingly moving.  The visual wonder of this movie is so palpable you  can almost touch it with your hand, and the performances are so in synch  that you become friends with these people by the time the Mother Ship  arrives -- especially Melinda Dillon and Richard Dreyfuss; Teri Garr is as  usual excellent, and Francois Truffaut is the perfect man to embody a  sympathetic scientist, filled with wonder.  When communication between  humans and aliens begins to explode, I found tears welling up in my eyes,  so complete was Spielberg's magic spell.  The fact that this movie  essentially features no real villian is remarkable; it manages to be  profoundly funny, sentimental, interesting and magical without any real  violence and no real character conflict/battle.  John Williams once again  provides a score of majesty and power; the creative collective genius who  concocted an alien encounter entirely through music, whether it was  Williams, Spielberg, the writers, or a combo, deserve(s) special mention,  and Williams' theme evokes precisely the right emotional chords to  transport you to the galaxies above, or at least to heaven.",movies

1174,174,2483,"Waiting for Indiana Jones IV to come to pass, it is always time to reflect on the sad state of Harrison Ford's career, and as we flip through the years it seems to me he hasn't had a bona fide hit since 1997.  (2000's WHAT LIES BENEATH probably made money, but few credit Ford's presence in that thriller for its success; possibly it was a hit due to the well-tuned script and the expert direction by Robert Zemeckis. In any case Michelle Pfeiffer--another star of the 1990s whose career has gone sadly awry--deserves half the credit as well.)  Otherwise it's like a list of one disaster after another.  K-19 THE WIDOWMAKER?  Dead in the water.  HOLLYWOOD HOMICIDE?  Not a bad show but the public stayed away in droves.  RANDOM HEARTS?  When you look up ""catastrophe"" in the dictionary you get a still from this movie.  SIX DAYS SEVEN NIGHTS?  Awful.  WATER TO WINE (2004)?  Even his fans don't know what it is!  I'm not sure FIREWALL will break the curse either, it sounds like a re-tread of an earlier Ford flop called FRANTIC.

So when we look back and try to find the last good patch of Harrison Ford's once invincible streak, we come up with a thump against this indisputable box office sensation, which rules the theaters world wide for a brief spell in 97.  The critics thought it piffle, but it answered a need in the US public, maybe to see a strong president defying the Russians one last time.  Reactionary?  No two moviegoers will read its plot the same way, but there are certainly cimilarities to the FOX TV hit ""24,"" which it foreshadowed in so many ways, even down to the canny use of amiably sinister Xander Berkeley, the husband in SAFE.  And of course the death defying traumas that occur to Air Force One in both programs.

Most of all, I think people long for a president who's more like James Marshall here, than the one we had in 1997 or the one we have now.  He's a father figure, he's still vigorous and sexy, he's got a good sense of humor, knows his way around a gun AND he protects us from the threat of Glenn Close.

AIR FORCE ONE itself was a sort of comeback project for the beleaguered Ford, whose previous films had been major disappointments--the terrible SABRINA remake and the muddled IRA thriller DEVIL'S OWN with Brad Pitt.  I think at that minute we really needed Harrison Ford to start thinking about how to sustain a career.  Instead he just must have said Ah Screw It and switched the remote to a then-new TV show called ALLY McBEAL.  The rest is film history.",movies

1177,177,4121,"Well, me for one. The main character of this movie, for another. But for some reason, not the main character's wife and kids.

Some people see this movie as the escape of the main character from the drudgery of life on earth. But I think they have missed the film completely.

Of the three versions of the film, I prefer the original. To explain why, let me begin simply by offering some snippets from the different edits, without explanation: In the original version, we are given a very meaningful cut going from a young child running after UFO's under the night sky, to the main character's music box playing, 'when you wish upon a star' from the Disney version of Pinocchio (instead of going to the main character's own kid bugging him about doing his homework for him, as in the later editions); in the original version we are given a meaningful cut going from the main character trying to explain what he saw to his wife, to his wife hiding newspaper clippings from her husband dealing with the same topic (instead of going to an old lost cargo ship somehow recently left in the desert of Mongolia, as in the later editions); in the original version we are given a seamless transition going from a team of scientists learning about a set of musical notes in India, to an attempt to translate them into hand signals, to an attempt to use them to contact the aliens by transmitting them by radio--to a young child successfully using the same notes on a toy xylophone.

The theme of this movie is about seeing the ordinary as extraordinary. It might also be called: ""Man, Machine and the Northern lights."" Or even, ""Pinocchio for Physics Majors."" Though ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" suits it well enough. First kind: sighting. Second kind: physical evidence. Third kind: contact. These terms were coined by Hynek to categorize reports of UFO's. Spielberg applies them in a way more down to earth. The ordinary things seen as extraordinary: technology, seen as part of nature, like the northern lights; human beings and relationships, seen as remarkable and unusual as alien encounters--or as wooden puppets become real boys. The hero portrays an ordinary man who is childlike and single hearted. In terms of categorization, the movie might best be characterized as a visual-musical fantasy, though strictly speaking it is of course science fiction. It is quite ingeniously directed and very beautifully choreographed. Superficially, it is about alien contact, but at a deeper level, it is a beautiful depiction of the limits (and limited validity) of a mechanical approach to life. In the end, it's more about human contact, than about alien contact.

The film consists of several sub-plots which gradually dovetail together. At the summit: The hero, Roy Neary, and a young boy, Barry Guiler, having kindred spirits, are, so to speak--through many trials and despite themselves--eventually brought together as family, one might even say providentially so. This family is contrasted to some vivid scenes of domestic life lived in narrow and petty way; the new family feels at home with itself while welcoming the most distant strangers: visitors from the stars. This openness is conveyed on the level of a child who is too innocent to even know the difference between an alien and a human; I would say, precisely, that it was Spielberg's main accomplishment in this film to convey it. Here Barry, a toddler, even steals the show--reportedly nicknamed by Spielberg as the ""one take"" kid! Though outwardly a movie about aliens, the visitors ultimately have, in this sense, the simple role of introducing the boy--and his widowed mom, Jillian--to the man (and very much from the point of view of the kid). It is, as it were, the antithesis of the premise for ""Lost in Space,"" of a family huddled together in an alien and hostile universe. If the child in you is dead, don't waste your time watching this film. If the adult in you is alive, be willing to see the film multiple times. It hangs together very well, but it takes multiple viewings to fully appreciate it and see why.

Perhaps it even takes the multiple re-cuts. This film made a big impact on me when I first saw the original version; watching the re-cuts and analyzing why it had such an impact for me did go hand in hand. It is very interesting to now see side-by-side the three different versions of this film which Spielberg came out with reworking it over the years; I'm happy to have the three provided together in this anniversary DVD. The line from the film which I made into the title of this review--spoken by one of Neary's sons--was actually not in the original cut. But it summarizes the original just as well as it does the other two versions (the ""special edition"" and the subsequent, ""director's cut""), nonetheless. Spielberg followed his gut in this film, but he didn't check his brain at the door. Both have served him well. I see the original edition as the definitive one, and the two re-cuts as commentary and footnotes. Spielberg has referred to the director's cut as penultimate. I do not exclude the possibility of a new, ultimate version. Spielberg says that the original version suffered by being rushed due to studio pressures, and that the special edition was compromised by studio politics which required a ""peek inside the mothership."" The director's cut, it seems to me (and others), was compromised by being made-for-tv.  The original or theatrical version won an Oscar for cinematography.  The second two editions do provide insight (and unused footage) into Spielberg's original vision; but I think the original cut still remains the best overall version to date.

Two fascinating, very effective and related themes of the film are seeing the world as new, as if for the first time, and persevering aspirations to be faithful to truth amid being called into question by more conventional points of reference. Neary is led at points even to question his sanity himself; the audience is given enough reasons to question his sanity too (or at least fear for his losing it), though are also provided with enough clues to leave open a positive final verdict.  On the one hand, for example, Roy is not concerned merely with UFO sight-seeing (even with his family)--he speaks in a number of places where he sees an importance to what he saw and the sharing of it with authorities--; on the other hand, when team of Lacombe (an international professional UFO investigator) first learns of the coordinates of the mountain where the aliens are planning a major visit, they wind up needlessly trashing some furniture (an expensive globe belonging to the county supervisor)--in other words, just what bad decisions will normal people make under extraordinary circumstances? The scenes where Neary inadvertently acts crazy in front of the neighbors--to gather material for building a large scale model mountain in his living room--were taken out from the special edition and restored in the director's cut; perhaps Spielberg worried the scenes put too much of the blame for the marriage breakup on Neary (and no, it's not like Neary has no flaws).  In the special edition, in fact, Ronnie leaves the house before we see anything of the large scale mountain; we only see Neary carrying a garden hose and his youngest son protesting being taken by his mom into the car saying that 'dad needs some more help'--with the car then proceeding to nearly run Neary over--; the version underscores: Ronnie deserted Neary.  (Though a relevant line of Ronnie's is only found in the original version, where she flatly states, 'I am not getting a job,' just minutes after getting the news Roy lost his job with the power company, a fact for which she was partly to blame as she was careless and nonchalant in passing on some urgent phones messages, including from the governor.)  Neary first noticed the real mountain on TV (after building--and regretting having made--the large scale model), in a news story covering a concocted ""nerve gas"" scare, which he saw just seconds after his wife abruptly hung up him (amid a sincere effort on his part to reconcile).  Alot to take in, a bit of a roller coaster, even for the audience.  Was Neary alone to blame for his marital problems, or did the failure to communicate (with Ronnie early on even literally plugging her ears), give him too much for him to deal with at once?  Roy was actually fired in the wake of his having been sent (also underscored only in the original version) to investigate the cause of a power failure--which he found--it was UFOs.  Did Neary, nevertheless, then abandon his kids and fail to provide for them, or did he, at least from the point of his wife hanging up on him, only pursue the best--or even the only way--to make good, provide a fuller appreciation of what is real, even secure visitation rights (against accusations of insanity)?  (It is sometimes said that good stories don't tell us what to think, rather, they simply give us things to think about.)  In any event, what Neary sacrifices to build the models, unexpectedly losing his family in the process, becomes very meaningful when he draws on this experience to climb the real thing--expressly going against a government cover-up story which evacuated the area to keep lay spectators away. Very intense scene, like a double jeopardy--and he is still not sure what he is going to find (nor is the audience). Beautifully shot. The last half hour of the film deserves its reputation, but the rest of the film is far from filler; it does, however, set the stage.  I do think the mountain-climbing scene is helped by showing the prior havoc involved in building the large scale model mountain; I think Spielberg was right to restore it to the director's cut.  Neary's recklessness in building the mountain was over the top, but his enthusiasm seemed to stem from being convinced that he was finally going to be able to share what he experienced with his family, though he was tragically mistaken.

Roy is vindicated at the end of the film in his conviction of the importance of his sighting--an importance which ultimately boils down, it seems to me, as the needed supplement for the limitations in a mechanical approach to communication. The limitations here are very beautifully portrayed in the final sequences by a ""musical"" conversation with the aliens, based on a five-tone sequence which humans first heard coming from the UFOs in India. Anticipating the importance of making the most of this for future communication, Lacombe makes use of a system for teaching music to the deaf to associate hand signals with the notes, which he teaches to the members of his team on the fly (in a nearly empty university auditorium). The notes were successfully imitated by radio to get in response (through radio telescopes) the coordinates of the mountain; they were also successfully used to initiate a whole musical conversation at the mountain itself (with a man at a keyboard and the mothership responding). But the hand signals were very nearly a case of being dressed up with no place to go. Computers were analyzing said musical conversation as it took place, searching for mathematical patterns (I imagine against a database), which the humans were doing their best to go along with, not by improvising, but by music theory. The computer found a pattern, took over the conversation, but it turned out to be incomplete. The computer could no longer respond to the mothership's prompts. The people were stumped too. (I don't fault Spielberg here for not telling us the formula the computer matched against the music, and why it sounded like music. Ever listen to mathematically generated fractal music? Some of it isn't bad, actually.) The point here was plainly that it was time for face to face contact. Lacombe was ready with his hand signals, but the aliens weren't too interested in them. They come out of the ship just romping and playing; they were looking for Roy. (An alien eventually does use the signals to wave goodbye--or was it hello / see you later?--to Lacombe, who had before waved his arms in exasperation when the aliens delayed responding to the musical tones.) To me explicitly having the theme of body language in the film made perfect sense. While you can't paint a real smile, you can study the difference between a real one and a posed one: they actually involve different facial muscles, even different neurological pathways. Neary's participation was necessarily spontaneous, and Lacombe was wise enough to understand its importance even from a more mechanical perspective: In its scientific defense, he refers to it as a ""sociological event."" To put it another way: Lacombe was ""left-brained,"" Neary was ""right-brained,"" and the two approaches come together in the end to make a fully-blown encounter of the ""third kind"" with aliens who are ""whole brained.""

Neary and Barry do have the common failing of not being notably articulate. Neary even once quotes Barry in trying to describe the UFOs as ""like an ice-cream cone""--adding only that its flavor was ""orange"" (and this being an improvement over his first attempt: ""there was a red whoosh...""). He does improve considerably in comparing them to the aurora borealis, the northern lights--but only mispronouncing ""borealis."" Jillian, more sensitive to the interpersonal side of things, does a better job too--and betraying herself a kindred spirit--when she spontaneously calls the visits in the sky ""Halloween for grownups."" Eventually standing at the end of a line of volunteer astronauts arranged by Lacombe (and the only one not carrying a large duffle-bag), Neary is singled out and playfully caressed by the playmate friends which Barry had already made, solidifying, confirming and celebrating the new family bonds (the most moving moment of the film, with music from Neary's favorite movie, Pinocchio, playing spaced-style ala John Williams). On the whole a remarkable accomplishment, and a Spielberg masterpiece (both written and directed by him). Taking nothing away from ""alien contact,"" it still in its own way trumps it with a ""family reunion."" This theme was to recur in E.T., but there alien contact becomes tongue-in-cheek and all-too-familiar; one might even say that E.T. is ""CE3K for dummies."" Barry was no less interesting or precious than any alien; at one scene it is even made obvious that he looks a bit like his alien friends. The deep, personal contact of the kindred souls, even if visceral and inarticulate, is the real ""encounter."" It was this simultaneous solidifying of earthly and extraterrestrial bonds which was really the most striking thing about the film. After welcoming Neary, and just after ""waving"" to Lacombe, the alien takes a moment to gaze upon the human crowd with such an expression of wonder and amazement, it is breathtaking; another inspiring, moving and thoughtful scene--as if Spielberg were holding up a mirror to the human race. When Neary was caressed by Barry's playmates, they visibly did so with a sense of awe and amazement, a moment which moved Jillian to tears as she witnessed it herself; in a sense she sees Neary through the aliens' eyes. Yet why shouldn't aliens act that way? Why suppose that these imaginary beings of the story are more jaded than Barry, Jillian or Neary? Neary's virtue might be summarized by the simple fact that (as expressed in his own words, while once commenting on the UFOs), he 'didn't want to see this;' he was just someone open to truth and faithful to whatever he saw. He wanted to see Pinocchio with his kids. Are such attitudes really so unbelievable or trivial, or are they neither?

""To the child the tree and the lamp post are as natural and as artificial as each other; or rather, neither of them are natural but both supernatural, for both are splendid and unexplained. The flower with which God crowns the one, and the flame with which Sam the lamplighter crowns the other, are equally of the gold of Fairy Tales[...]In the middle of the wildest fields the most rustic child is, ten to one, playing at steam engines. And the only spiritual or philosophical objection to steam engines is not that men pay for them or work at them or make them very ugly or even that men are killed by them, but merely that men do not play at them[...]The evil is that the childish poetry of clockwork does not remain[...]The wrong is not that engines are too much admired, but that they are not admired enough[...]The sin is not that engines are mechanical, but that men are mechanical."" -G. K. Chesterton

CE3K is this passage put to film.

Some digressions with tidbits and trivia:

Unfortunately the digital transfer (both for DVD and for Blu-ray) was not entirely successful.  Excessive graininess in some of the scenes and particularly disappointing is some blurriness / halos around the special effects (all three problems for the landing of the mothership).  The UFOs in the original film actually enjoyed some degree of 'photo-realism;' they did *not* just appear as 'moving neon lights,' each a 'red whoosh' with no visible object (i.e., nothing reflecting ambient light), though too often in the transfer they appear to be just that.  Having viewed the DVD shortly after seeing the original again as it made a one-time showing in a local theater (not too many years back), which was still using standard film projectors, and I immediately noticed the difference.  Comparing CE3K's preservation, to the restored version of the original Star Wars, is just plain sad.  (I've heard rumors that Trumbull actually filmed the original effects for CE3K in 65mm; in any event, to my eye, the digital transfer is noticeably poorer than the 35mm.)  Perhaps it can be said that even Chaplin film restorations have now enjoyed better final results; it can be hoped that one day CE3K will enjoy a better transfer.

There is a very awkward cut in the special edition (and in the director's cut) dealing with the Neary family, where Ronnie is first sitting with some of Roy's junk in her hands--and then, just moments later, when it cuts back to her--we see her holding her daughter instead. In the original edition, the scene of Ronnie holding her daughter is the first time we see her.  Teri Garr did a great job as Ronnie, though in my opinion she gave a more nuanced and moving performance in, 'The Black Stallion.'

I could never understand why the trucks secretly hauling scientific equipment are disguised as Piggly Wiggly and Baskin Robbins trucks. At that point they were still trying to figure out what cover story to get people out of the area with; maybe they were thinking of scaring them away with high cholesterol foods? I also find it hard to understand why there is a scene showing the volunteer astronauts wearing the special red suits as they go into a chartered bus. When sitting in what looks like a university auditorium, learning the hand signals, they are not wearing the red suits, but are singled out by having ""special"" seats off to the side. So why do they need the suits going into the bus in order to be visually singled out for the audience? The scene where the team members damage the expensive globe is a bit jolting, and seems a bit silly at first; but I can imagine they were planning to bring it back from the get go not realizing how big it was until they got to the county supervisor's office where it was kept, and so, instead of going back to get the coordinates and paper, they stuck to the original idea of just bringing back the globe for everyone to see, and thus infamously dropped it to the floor and rolled it to their destination.  True enough, when people wing it, stuff happens.

I can only say that the Wyoming tower (known by Native American cultures as 'Bear Lodge' and a traditional place for religious retreat), for the final scenes, was an inspired choice by Spielberg.  Situated in a lush prairie and part of the Black Hills, it is evidently the only volcanic structure in the North American plains (protruding through layers of exposed sedimentary rocks dating back to the Triassic age) and effectively symbolizes as well as gives a visceral sense of something which reaches deep into the earth.  Spielberg has said he wanted to underscore the earthly location of the story; he succeeded beautifully.  Add to that even its 'western name' mentioned in the film--insofar as it only underscores a tower which goes down instead of up--or rather, given that the mothership arrives upside down before turning right side up to land: poetry in motion.  The earthly witnesses of the mothership, looking up, are thus shown looking 'down' onto city skyscrapers made by aliens who, wherever they are from, have long looked towards the earth simply when looking up towards their sky.  (Of course, we need not appeal to extraterrestrials, to accommodate these differences in perspective.)  Add to that the fact that it is a national monument which most people, including most Americans, have never seen: impeccable.

It was real life nephew of Richard Dreyfuss, who plays Neary's younger son Toby (perhaps that is why he had a easier time than his elder brother, Brad, to take in stride Neary's apparent nervous breakdown).

When the movie was first released Watergate scandal / conspiracy was fresh off the press.  Spielberg has said he included a government cover up, to add a sense of realism, even if it is a sort of bluff: how does the audience know that these things of the movie, as well, aren't, 'actually going on right now,' just not the news?  Then again, while CE3K begins, it does not end, in a familiar mock docudrama format (also known to audiences at the time from 'documentaries' on Big Foot and the Loch Ness Monster); there is even a character in CE3K who, as a believer in both, compares Big Foot to UFOs in the same breath at a press conference, to Neary's humiliation.  If the film is dated (of course it is in incidental things, like the Nearys' home furnishing, e.g., the color portable boob tube, complete with a dial to change channels, the aviator style glasses so many are wearing, along with the obvious absence in the storyline of GPS and cell phone cameras) I don't think it can be dated in this way.  The film's realism, to its credit, only cuts both ways.  The conspiracy aspect of the film is actually quite limited; the film really only presents it as Major Walsh's idea, for the sake of evacuating people, to secure the area.  Neary is its chief, largely unintentional, victim.  Neary at one point says, 'the army is getting us out of here because they don't want any witnesses.'  They?  Meaning Lacombe?  Neary doesn't say who 'they' is because Neary doesn't (yet) know who they is.  Lacombe, was arguing with Walsh, at that very moment.

The UFO experts themselves in the movie didn't know what to expect to happen at the site any more than did Neary.  Perhaps they knew less; the movie depicts some commercial airline pilots as seeing what Neary and Jillian saw early on, but the pilots decided not to report it (perhaps so as to not risk being labeled nuts and losing their jobs).  The cover up, fittingly, is not presented as invented for the sake of permanently deceiving the world--or involving the UN, the Man from UNCLE, or even the entire US government--and it was not Lacombe's idea at all.  An American UFO expert, who also comments near the end that 'Einstein was right' (a colleague jokingly responding that 'Einstein was probably one of them,' i.e., among those who took a ride on the mothership, thus having had personal experience confirming his prediction of time dilation), was the top official at the press conference, where he told spectators along with Neary, 'I don't know what you saw.'  He obviously knew more than other officials present at the conference yet there is also no reason to believe he was not sincere in his comments.  He was presented simply as discrete, diplomatic, scientifically skeptical; not as conspiratorial.  Perhaps this *could* date the film if: (1) it cannot be fully appreciated if enjoyed as science fiction and/or (2) it's narrative tacitly relies upon audiences, if only by drawing upon Orwell, to imagine many extra layers of 'cover up' and/or (3) historians of science have determined that the direct experimental confirmation of time dilation for space travel had come way before GPS.  No way did the mothership pass unnoticed; Major Walsh simply did *not* evacuate a big enough area.

Walter Cronkite, though mentioned by name, was not the newscaster making the cameo in the movie.  It was, however, the also prominent real life newscaster Howard K. Smith.  There is no suggestion he is to be taken in the story (let alone in reality) as part of any conspiracy; presumably the character was just reporting what Major Walsh and his team told him regarding a relatively mundane story about a train accident.

Personally, I was never much into UFOs, a fact which never detracted from my enjoyment of the movie in the least.  The film did spark my interest enough to actually read (Prof. J. Allen) Hynek's book (i.e., by a prominent, long time astrophysicist, at Northwestern University); yet my conclusion, precisely from reading it, was that there is nothing to it.  What I have read since (notably, regarding the 'anthropic principle' in cosmology, as discussed for example in a book coauthored by astronomer John Barrow and physicist Frank Tipler), has led me to the conclusion that the scientific consensus regarding intelligent life elsewhere (even insofar as it takes into account the Drake equation, just not all the principles invoked by Star Trek), is that, in point of fact, the odds are astronomically against it. The intuitive argument that the universe is so big that it must, rather, be likely, evidently doesn't hold up, as when taking into account the age and size of the universe and the complexity of DNA, the numbers just don't crunch that way.  Then again, by the same token, the odds of us being here would also be astronomically against it, so I won't belabor the point; in any event, here we are.

CE3K was one of the original 'box office blockbusters;' following Jaws, Spielberg, 'did it again;' in other words *alot* of people liked it. This is the only dimension of added 'realism' that has ever meant anything to me; Hynek cameo included, I have never met anyone who thought it was a documentary.  Looking for evidence of friendly and intelligent life in the universe?  A Lily Tomlin joke aside, look no further; even if the 1950s left you wondering, they are actually making movies now, they are even sitting in theaters, right next to you.

Spielberg has referred to his making of the film as a sort of catharsis.  I can understand that.

The grand finale begins immediately after Neary and Jillian show up.  The first few scout ships, pass right by them, before going to the landing area and then signaling to the other ships.  The film therefore does pose the question whether the final encounter (especially of the third kind) would have taken place at all if none of those 'invited' had actually arrived.  Perhaps the aliens would have suspected something was wrong or that humanity just wasn't ready.

CE3K has not enjoyed a sequel.  That's fine; leaves it to the imagination, a bit like the ending of, 'The Life of Pi.'  After learning what Neary went through, does the future activity of the aliens include arranging a special visit with Neary's kids?  Does Neary reconcile with Ronnie?  Does he marry Jillian? What happens to Major Walsh?  It makes no sense for the mothership simply to take Neary away and never return.

The inserted scene in the special edition, which depicts the Cotopaxi as found in the Gobi desert (the 1920s cargo ship thought lost in the Bermuda triangle), in my view has the failing of overextending the mock docudrama format (as well as interfering with the lyrical timing) of the original version.  Though it was nicely filmed, I also have no idea why the helicopters are flying fast so close to the sand dunes, following their contour.

I wouldn't touch the scene where the mothership, when seen for the first time, seems to rise over the mountain rather than descend from space; it is a very powerful visual symbolizing being both ""on earth and among the stars""--and is just ambiguous enough to allow for the mothership merely ""appearing"" to rise while in fact traveling horizontally (relative to the ground at the tower)--an appearance perhaps due to the size of the ship and/or the curvature of the earth--it leaves the audience wondering a bit just what is going on--kind of like watching a moonrise. However, on very close scrutiny, it seems there were some minor flaws in the special effects concerning the mothership (perhaps due to a rushed editing job, which Spielberg admits): In certain scenes the mothership does not appear quite as big as other scenes require. Basically, in the shot of the rising/landing mothership, it should appear about 4x or even 8x (at least 2x) as large if it is to be the ""city in space"" (though even at 1/2 x it would still be too big to escape the notice of Howard K. Smith) which the more close-up shots of the mothership (both outside the ship, as given by all versions, and inside, as given by the special edition) require. (I suspect a similar scene in 'Independence Day' was closer to what Spielberg was technically going for.) Still, the visuals are remarkably effective and quite beautiful, and give a very memorable impression.

I've given alot of analysis, but I don't think I've spoiled anything.  Chesterton echoes Einstein:

""The fairest thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion which stands at the cradle of true art and true science. He who knows it not and can no longer wonder, no longer feel amazement, is as good as dead, a snuffed-out candle."" (Albert Einstein)

1178,178,6129,"This gem of horror from 1985, featured Roddy McDowall as the great vampire killer, who is quite shaky, though ends the film with much bravery, William Ragsdale as a sex-crazed teenager and Chris Sarandon as a new neighbor with a little bite. Also showing up on the scene are Amanda Bearse as the present-day Mina and Stephen Geoffreys as Evil Ed, who is an absolute riot in the film. This vampire classic is not only for me, the best vampire film, but perhaps the best horror film. This movie is one of the great definitions of entertainment. There's some great special effects in the film including a very freaky Evil Ed-wolf and a menacing Jerry Dandridge-bat. Tom Holland, a master of horror who's also directed Child's Play, and written such creepy-pleasers as The Beast Within and Psycho II has given this film a great foggy atmosphere and vibe-full colors, and a great 2:35.1 widescreen aspect ratio that is an incredible delight.

1181,181,4418,"This is the first movie where Tom Hanks really began to show his depth. It was a film that required him to open with the comedic chops he's honed so well but then, because of the deepening of the film's story from comedy to drama, requested so much more of him. He ultimately delivers in spades.

This is really a story about a son moving very fast in the fast lane of advertising. He's a pro and he loves what he does. He's also a personality that lives on charm and in the moment.  But when his parents separate after years of marriage, his life changes rapidly from no personal responsibilities to a multitude of them. It's also begs a question that rarely gets told well- how do sons and daughters deal with parents as life turns the tables and we suddenly start having to deal with listening to and taking care of them? The changing of roles and responsibilities. As the film unfolds, it presents those concerns with proper weight, depth, sadness, growth and understanding.

Gary Marshall directed the film prior to his mega hit with Pretty Woman but I really think this is the better film of the two. He draws the best from Jackie Gleason, Eva Marie Saint and Beth Armstrong and Hector Alonzo- each lending a real ensemble cast feeling to the piece and although Tom Hanks shines- so do they.

Jackie Gleason deserves special mention because he really plays a rather hard, sad man at the end of the road as a clothing salesman, and he digs deep, never lending anything false to how this man thinks, feels and operates. The exchanges between him and Hanks about how he was raised lend a real truth to the role.

If you're looking for a film that has some humor and some depth of feeling in the same breath, this is an interesting evening's viewing.

An underrated film that deserves a second look and a larger audience.",movies

1188,188,3897,"are on blu-ray, in the 2-disc set, all are excellent, for different reasons, and all are part of cinematic history.

I like Spielberg's third Director's Cut the best, except that it excludes Roy at the power station in the beginning which was shown in the 1977 original theatrical release version.  This scene was important, to show why Roy chooses not to show up for that job anymore after his initial UFO sighting (the job was thankless and his bosses were real A-holes).

Flip-flopped in the Special Edition and Director's Cut are the night sighting picnic with the India ""Where did these sounds come from?"" segments, which, I think, flow better in the order they were presented in the 1977 version.  The cut between the night sighting picnic that turns out to be noisy helicopters and the subsequent dead-quiet of the observation station is more jarring in the latter two versions than in the 1977 version, where the noisy helicopter's search light on Roy cuts to the cars arriving in India in sunlight.  But, in the grand scheme, of the timeline of chronologically telling the story, one can see why Spielberg flip-flopped the order of these two scenes.

The ""pillow mountain bit"" is happily removed from the latter two versions; never much cared for that.

Carl Weathers (Apollo Creed of Rocky fame) does a brief cameo in the 1977 version as an Army seargant who interrogates suspicious-looking Roy, who looks like a potential looter, during the evacuation sequence, when the bird salesman is doing a great scare job in the background.  This bit, quirky but not really necessary, is happily removed from the latter two versions, and instead the scene hangs on the bird salesman saying ""Even my dog has a gas mask!  And any of you folks are worth more than a dog!""  Funny.

The Roy in the bathtub fully-clothed sequence, which ends in a horrible screaming match that involves the whole Neary family, followed by the Roy yanking out the neighbor's chicken wire and throwing bricks and dirt into his kitchen window to build his ultimate Devil's Tower model next day, perfectly segues into Roy's wife, Ronnie, taking the kids and leaving for her sister's, for good, in the Director's Cut.  In the 1977 cut, we don't know what the heck Ronnie is talking about when she says to Roy, in the morning, ""I'm sorry about last night"", and, in the 1980 Special Edition cut, the entire Roy throwing dirt into the house scene is excised, cutting from Roy realizing that Devil's Tower has a cut-off peak, to Ronnie taking the kids, which also doesn't make sense.  I'm glad Spielberg finally got it right by including BOTH scenes in his Director's Cut.

This is one of the most AWESOME achievements in cinematic history, a triumph of human imagination, and a film that has a truly noble, altruistic agenda, in an era of otherwise formulaic ""beastie"" monster movies.  It gets the awesome transfer, in all 3 versions, that it deserves.  Spielberg's critics said ""lightning can't strike twice"" after the wunderkind young director struck a massive bolt with his last stroke of genius, Jaws.  They were wrong!

This set has excellent behind-the-scenes extras, including the classic 1977 Watch the Skies featurette that was shown in cinemas (finally transferred here in HD!), a complete 1997 retrospective produced by Laurent Bouzereau, and some new interviews with Spielberg, also produced and directed by Bouzerau, that shed new ""light"" on the whole project.

Plus, if you have a dvd player with dynamic sound which evens things out you will NEVER hear the dialogue unless you turn it off due to the poor overpowering imposition of the soundtrack over the dialogue.

It looks and sounds Great! And I'm not going to tell you it's an excellent movie, you already know that--great British humor(actually universal humor), ridiculously funny, great actors. And a silly price of only $9.99 (was $12.99 on release date).

Sony did a 1080p transfer(1.66:1 original aspect ratio) of this movie that looks amazing! There's lots of strong detail in faces, clothes, as well as surroundings like buildings, grass, trees. Flesh and earth tones look very natural. Blacks are deep. Strong color is not going to jump out at you, but that's just the nature of the film as the outdoor setting of much of the movie's grass, dirt, and rocks(browns, blacks, grays & greens) never contained strong color elements. But what color there is (like in the tabards,coat of arms, shields) looks very good indeed. Is the movie without soft shots or grain? No, but they've brought out a whole lot of nicely rendered detail that makes the movie a joy to watch. Until now, I feel like I've only seen this movie through a fog. Well, the fog has finally lifted and everything looks sooo fresh.

The audio is a lossless soundtrack (DTS-HD MA 5.1 lossless). Voices sound very crisp and clear. Sound effects in general are very good. Audiofiles will notice some very rich sounding sections, but also some that are just acceptable. Overall, it is very enjoyable with nice use of surround sound and I think most people will be more than happy with it.

1193,193,7710,"You should see this movie. It is good enough to see at least once depending on taste. I plan on seeing it a second time in the theatre for anything I missed while I was cringing in my seat. (which wasn't much--but I really liked this movie)
I am really getting annoyed with the bad reviews this movie is getting though. Some of the reviewers trash the movie always referring to the Alice in Wonderland theme and Anderson's past film credits (Mortal Kombat). Now tell me honestly...how many times was Alice's (Milla) name even mentioned? How many times was the mansion referred to as Looking Glass House? Not many. So why complain about that tid bit? And as far as original...what HAS been original in horror films lately? Most everything in one fashion or another has been done or copied. So just enjoy the ride. Sit back and let it take you because it DOES.
I am sure that while it seems a little odd, Anderson wanted this to be kind of like Alice down the rabbit hole scenerio. Who wouldn't be feeling that way in this situation?
I thought that this movie (the game series aside) was very eye stimulating and chilling. The zombies were a little...well they could have been scarier or something but they're zombies not mutant zombies so what do you expect?
From the opening scene in the elevator that was pretty heart stuttering to a confused, upset, and nearly nude Milla in the middle of Racoon City. I was really excited to see the end scene because it has the feel of a sequel and perhaps this movie being sort of a PREQUEL to the game kind of thing, we'll see more of what we wanted to see when we thought this was the first game in the series. (It will just be RE2 that's all)
I would like to see a sequel. No doubt about it. It got jolts and scares out of me despite reading the scorn and criticism I'd read before seeing the movie. I mean-- I liked Aliens, I liked The Cube, I like zombies and freaky scenes. The red queen was pretty neat and I thought Milla and Michelle rocked.

The fisher man with the hook for a hand is back after Hewitt and her obnoxious friends which include returning Freddy Prinze, Brandy, and Mekhi Pfefier as the token black guy.

Little do they know that it has all been set-up by the killer from the original and he is looking for a little more retribution. A predictably gory onslaught ensues to the backdrop of an incoming storm that is making life even more difficult for these poor kids.
Hewitt is the highlight of this film- but not for her acting chops. Her beautiful cleavage and knack for wearing soaking-wet white T-shirts is really the only redeeming value in this very dumb sequel. Jack Black as a goofy white wannabe Jamiacan is too annoying for words. Freddy Prinze is as terrible as always in his portrayal of goofy guy-next-door Ray. Love gets to do her thing here as she not only sings karaoke but gets to explain to co-star Pfeifer why ""her people can't dance"". Even tremendous character actor, Bill Cobbs, is wasted in this awful sequel. It's over-acting galore as Hewitt and Brandy trade screams and arguments back and forth in the rain.

One thing the movie did very well in the beginning was to condense years of abuse by Jane's aunt and Mr. Brocklehurst into a few key horrific scenes that also point out the affection that Jane felt for her friend Helen, the few kind teachers and later her pupils.
Ciaran Hinds as the hero begins with a great deal of roaring and bluster, but here and there are hints that this is a screen he uses to protect himself from the pain of intimacy.  The key to Mr. Rochester's character is in the scene in which he tells Jane about his ""grand passion"" and how he was betrayed by the woman he adored.  Juxtapose this against the first Mrs. Rochester's passion for him that overset her reason.
Samantha Morton does a lovely job of portraying an innocent who is not ignorant of the darker aspects of human nature-- Lowood School taught her more than reading, writing and geography.

This is an awesome concert. The only two problems are that 1) it is just 67 minutes long and 2) John Doe's bass is buried too deep in the mix.

Every X fan should get this. More importantly, anyone who doesn't know about X should get this.

Why X? Did you know, for example, that:
- X has a different sound based on the unique harmonies between co-lead singers Exene Cervenka and John Doe that really sets them apart from anything else out there?
- Doe, Cervenka and drummer DJ Bonebrake also play in the country punk band The Knitters?
- Billy Zoom, the guitarist who originally formed the band, used to play rockabilly guitar for Gene Vincent and other big stars, and has been voted one of the greatest guitar players ever by Guitar Player magazine?
- X were playing Leadbelly tunes way before Kurt Cobain?
- Ray Manzarek, keyboard player of The Doors, produced X's first four albums?

- Billy Zoom left the band from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, but during this time the band still managed to record&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Live-at-the-Whisky-a-Go-Go/dp/B000005IRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X Live at the Whisky a Go-Go</a>, one of the greatest live rock albums ever, with guitarist Tony Gilkyson?

As this DVD proves, X is still as good as ever. Billy Zoom still plays standing in his trademark splayed-leg stance with a broad grin on his face. Did I say he is awesome? Awesome.

The commune breaks things up a bit, but the fun only really starts when Jack Nicholson joins the club.  Truly, Nicholson is one of the greatest actors ever.  From Terms of Endearment to Batman, Nicholson makes almost any movie worth watching.  Same here.
Many scenes are laugh out loud funny.  I was rolling on the floor laughing during the exchage about aliens.  The drug trips are interesting.  The music is a huge part of the culture and so it is in the movie.

1221,221,6745,"Up until this film I did not have a very positive view of Barbara Streisand's acting ability.  Despite my tendency to hold on to my opinions past their time, I have changed my mind in a dramatic way. This film  undeniably proves that Streisand is a very talented actress. Nolte on the  other hand has always had great potential, even if it hasn't been realized  in every film he appeared in. No need to worry, in ""The Prince of  Tides"" he is tremendous.

This wonderful drama contains  elements of horror and suspense but its strength comes from the romance  that blossoms between the psychiatrist Susan Lowenstein, (Streisand), and  the failing football coach, Tom Wingo, (Nolte).  These two have a chemistry  which draws them together against their will and sucks the audience along  for the ride. Additional complexity, derived from the fact that they are  both married, also enriches the experience.

Because the story is  ostensibly about the struggles Tom goes through as a result of his Sister's  latest suicide attempt, the film often travels back in time. Lowenstein  needs Tom to fill in the blanks about his sister's life so that she can be  better treated. Unfortunately Tom is almost as reluctant to recall his  childhood events as his comatose sister.  This is not at all surprising  when we eventually discover all the details.

We slowly learn,  along with Lowenstein, about a severe and traumatic family history. Three  children, of whom Tom is one, are spiritually imprisoned by an abusive  father and a manipulative, ambitious mother. Their only comfort is in each  other, which is expressed perfectly whenever their parents fight, by their  escape underwater where they hold hands in a ring of love. In the present  though, even this bond has been sundered. Tom's older brother is now dead  and his sister has lived away from him in New York for many years.

There are many sub-plots running through the story. Tom's inability  to deal with his wife, Susan's problems with her son Bernard and her famous  violinist husband, Tom and his Sister's repressed memories and his mother's  attempts to keep it all hidden. Overall it is undeniably a rich and  compelling film. It serves as an example of how good drama can be.",movies

1229,229,8576,"This is the story of two brothers (Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt), sons of a Presbyterian minister (Tom Skerritt), growing up in rural Montana in the early part of the 20th century.  All three are passionate about fly-fishing to the extent that it becomes a form of worship for them.  As the years go by, the family begins to grow apart as the older brother makes a life for himself in another part of the country and the younger brother, though remaining close to home, drifts away from his spiritual upbringing into a life of gambling and alcohol.  Yet they always have fly-fishing, a bond that allows them to periodically and temporarily reestablish the closeness that has been lost.  This film is very interesting and moving in the way it portrays the tension between the reality of children establishing their own lives away from their parents and the resulting sorrow and nostalgia over the weakening of familial bonds.  It also explores the mysterious way in which some people seem to be drawn onto self-destructive paths./",movies

1234,234,1942,"December 1776: The Revolution thus far, was a disaster.

For twelve months the first American patriots had endured very little success against the British, being out-classed and routed from the battlefield in almost every engagement. Desertion was rampant. Arms, ammunition, and rations were scarce. Only a small number of the Revolutionaries had any military experience.

Even worse, as was usual in warfare until the 20th century, epidemic diseases were the major cause of casualties, with so many men living together in the open under unsanitary conditions. As if this wasn't bad enough, it was winter, and most of Washington's demoralized troops had only days left to their enlistment contracts.

With the Revolution on the verge of collapse, General Washington needed a victory, ...immediately.

At this point in American History, ...America, OUR nation, was dangerously close to never HAVING a history. This was, quite possibly, the most critical moment in the story of America. The man who signifigantly changed our national destiny at this moment in time, was George Washington.

So how did General Washington save the Revolution from collapse? The story is portrayed most excellently in this movie!

General Washington received intelligence that a regiment of German Hessian mercenaries had made winter-quarters in Trenton, New Jersey. The troops from Hess were considered amongst the very best of professional soldiers in Europe. They had already inflicted severe defeats upon the Revolutionaries earlier that year. It was a long shot, with what limited resources he had under his command, ...but Washington realized that he just might have a chance at a much-needed victory, ...if all went as planned. Surely he did not expect his operation to result in one of the most one-sided victories in military history!

Washington made his proposal to his subordinates. Most of them were vehemently opposed to the operation, given all the factors involved. The weather was abyssmal, intense cold and freezing rain. To get to Trenton, they had to cross the Delaware River, which was already full of large chunks of ice, and a limited quantity of boats.

Despite the various obstacles, they adapted, improvised, and overcame.

They moved their ragged, starving, inexperienced army across the water, marching all night, cold and drenched to the bone! Many of these fellows didn't have shoes. It rained most of the way. The gun-powder was too wet to fire their rifles and muskets. Only the artillery had dry powder, ...which they used to great effect.

This factor makes the nature of this victory at Trenton even more amazing:
The Revolutionary army fixed bayonets, and rushed the town, KILLING the much more proficient enemy at CLOSE-QUARTERS! The completely surprised Hessian troops had just spent the previous night drunkenly carousing and feasting on Christmas Eve. Not one of them expected to be impaled by bayonets in the morning! Not one Revolutionary soldier was killed or injured in the attack on Trenton! Needless to say, ...this victory had the desired result on American morale.

The man who delivered this Christmas Present to America was OUR Founding Father, ...George Washington!
He succeeded because he was assisted by REAL MEN who were determined to accomplish this mission.

The real signifigance of this movie:
There have been several moments in the history of America, at home and abroad, where the nation faced seemingly overwhelming enemies, and abyssmally dire circumstances. This film portrays one of the first of such incidents. REAL AMERICANS take action. They lock and load, fix bayonets, ...and by the grace of God force a glorious victory from what was presumed to be an ""inevitable"" defeat. Be thankful that we had a REAL AMERICAN in command on Christmas Day of 1776!",movies

Few Americans realize how close this nation came to losing its bid for independence from Great Britain.  It was Washington's bold raid on Trenton that resurrected the American cause.  Never before or since has our country been so close to utter defeat and needed a military victory more.  This film offers a detailed and entertaining glimpse at this incredible feat of arms.  Jeff Daniels is excellent in the role as our first Commander-in-Chief.  The production values are good as well.  It's almost like looking back over 200 years at an event as it was happening.

1242,242,7252,"Having seen the Ingrid Bergman version ""Joan of Arc"", and now ""The Messenger"", anyone who is somewhat familiar with that period's personalities would agree that somewhere in-between lies the true Joan.

The Milla Jovovich version is a bit too irreverant but warrior enough to join the bloody gnashing of teeth and breaking of heads as was customary in battle those days.  So...for those too unkind with this film, you must agree that somewhere in between is Joan of Arc and we needed both versions to realistically form a picture of what she was truly like.  Both films were well directed and well acted.",movies

1249,249,5652,"Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) has a big problem - and not just one. He's a seemingly ordinary New York cabbie who?s stalking one woman, Betsy (Cybil Shepard) while playing savior to another, Iris (Jodie Foster). But ol' Trav' is just a few coins short of a full meter, a neurotic oversight that will allow him to turn vigilante, threaten the political reelection campaign of Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris) and blow away Iris?s pimp/drug dealer (Harvey Keitel). Suffice it to say, ""Taxi Driver"" is not your feel good movie of the summer. It is a cinematic snapshot of 70s pop culture gone horribly awry, with its crack and whore infested streets, its unstable social setting for easy scores and cheap sex, and a seething underbelly of corruption and dismal isolation as its acrid palette for moral decay. Travis? slow spiral into becoming the loner with a purpose is predicated upon warping the old adage and precedent that one man can make a difference. But when that one man is touched by his own sexual and financial inadequacies, his psychotic inability to bond with another human being and his self delusion - that he is on par with a deity, above the rest of humanity and the law ? then the difference he can make is between destroying himself and bringing about the next apocalypse.
Martin Scorsese directs adeptly enough, drawing the viewer into this dark world of unsettling realities. The irony of the ending seems somewhat strained and rather a bit like the happy ending tack on associated with conventional Hollywood wisdom, but there is the frightening prospect that with a return to normalcy, Travis? alter ego is, like many a volcano, merely dormant, not dead, and destined to erupt in the future.

The transfer from Columbia is a rather disappointing remastering effort. There are moments when the color is bold, if dated, and moments when fine detail is generally realized to good effect. But the bulk of this video presentation is riddled with excessive grain ? both film and digital, a barrage of compression artifacts, a lot of aliasing, some tiling, and a considerable amount of edge enhancement. Night scenes break apart with pixelization and exhibit a very muddy color scheme. There's plenty of age related dirt and grit to further detract from your viewing experience. The audio has been remastered - but just barely - with low to no bass and a really screechy high end that betrays the original mono elements. Extras include a 70 minute making of documentary with interviews featuring the director and principle cast, a photo montage, still gallery, theatrical trailer and storyboard sequences.",movies

The story line had very few flaws and did a great job of setting the premise for those who had no idea about the game.

1267,267,6932,"From my experience, all sci-fi films need one very important ingredient... and this is ATMOSPHERE. Its the foundation block for all great movies in this genre. From classics like Star Wars to new favourites like The Matrix. They tell not just a story, but also of a world different to the one we reside in. That is the heart of a great sci-fi. Without it, characters, plot, nor action can develop. This is where Resident Evil Apocalypse falls apart. From the beginning we are rushed into an established storyline. It begins with a few words from the narrator, explaining the damage already done... and instantly we are expected to follow the paper-thin characters on their journey to righteousness. Its difficult to really care, when we are given little time to absorb the horror of a city under fire. Scenes flip from one character to another, each with a separate agenda. Everything is robotic, human interaction and emotion is minimal and the impact of armageddon is ignored. Its derivative, ironcially much like a computer game, you get bitten... its game over. That is it.

The influences are all there, simplified, squeazed and chopped together.

'Dawn of the Dead' a generic town is ravaged by a zombie outbrake shown in a TV report like fashion

'28 Days later' she wakes in a deserted hospital

'Terminator' dressed in a full leather with a mini gun.

'Robo cop' Remembers friend and defies command to KILL

'Tomb Raider' Girl with two guns wrapped around her thigh

'Aliens' aliens

'Matrix' the action

In the end, it has little originalty, and fails to improve on past formula. Post Viral-Apocalyptic films like Omega Man, Dawn of the dead series and 28 Days Later do a much superior job in creating a world in chaos.. the hysteria, tension, loneliness, despair, humour. That was riveting.

1272,272,1707,"I must fervently disagree with the many positive reviews shown here, for 2 major reasons.  First, the writers took great 'liberties' with the novel that detract, rather than enhance, the characters.  The best two examples involve the main characters of Mr. Rochester and Jane.  In the book, Rochester is a brooding, singular figure who is very much a victim of the cruel plotting and vices of others.  But in this film version, he is cruel and vindictive in and of himself.  Vengeful, plotting, and profane, you have little reason to see why Jane would ever attach herself to such a worthless creature.  Jane of course does fall in love with him, but because he is so repugnant, the viewer can hardly see any reason why.  Thus, Jane is herself reduced greatly from a woman who loves unconditionally - -as was shown in the book- -to a strange, misguided young woman racked with a codependent psyche.  The second area in which this version is inferior to the book, and the other far superior film versions (particularly the William Hurt version) is its brevity.  It is only 90 minutes long.  It leaves out so many of the small aspects that would normally give vitality and life to the characters.  Being that it is such a poor version, this is not necessarily all that bad, but willing to give the film chance after chance to redeem itself, it falls terribly short on nearly every measure.",movies

Like the life of Jesus, Joan's life is vague on the printed page, and Hollywood has had a history of its own trying to fill in the gaps.  No two films about her are alike.
So I guess it comes down to the viewer's faith, whether Joan was a saint or just a simple peasant girl who inspired a nation.
This film presents a more human approach to her story, and whether it is historically truthful is beside the point.  After all, this is a Hollywood film, not a documentary.  And as a Hollywood film, it works very well for me.  The look of the movie is stunning, and that alone should make it worth, at the very least, a one-time rental.  But the acting is so fine, with Milla Jovovich doing a superb job of creating a most difficult role.
If a more religious, faith-based treatment is required by the viewer, stick with the cardboard performance by Ingrid Bergman.",movies

1300,300,319,"If you want the classic version, go with the George C. Scott or Patrick Stewart version. If you want the best family version, go with the Muppet Christmas Carol, which stars Michael Caine and is suprisingly good. But if you want to hear the same old story told in a new, effective setting, get this movie.  As a depression-era American miser whose experiences parallel Scrooge's, Henry Winkler gives a convincing (and at times heart-wrenching) performance. The supporting cast, including Dorian Harewood, also turn in exceptional performances. Nothing in this movie is tacky, anachronistic, overacted, or otherwise out of place - it is as well-crafted a Christmas movie as you can find. And if it leaves you completely untouched, let's just say that you may need some nocturnal visitors to give you Christmas spirit a special ""jump start"" this year.  In short, this movie deserves your family's full attention in the coming Christmas season.  I'm glad it's out on DVD, as we've worn out two videotapes of the show.

The acting, portrayal of conditions and general lack of support and material for prosecuting a war against Great Britain was well done. The moral of the Continental Army under Washington was at an all-time low prior to the crossing. Indeed they had known little but defeat until that time. Washington even had his doubts about whether some of his chief commanders would even follow orders.
The story of the crossing, the hanging in the balance of the war with Great Britain, and the attack on Trenton are all masterfully done. Kudoes to A&E. May they continue to produce more historically based efforts of this quality in the future.

1309,309,6587,"Stone won't make himself vulnerable to anyone or the facts, whether that means eliminating all JFK conspiracy theories other than his own or simplifying a story and people as he has done here in Midnight Express.  Stone borrowed Billy Hayes' real story of being held in a Turkish prison for several years after being caught smuggling hashish, and hijacked it to devastating effect.  [I focus on screenwriter Stone instead of director Parker because the substance of Hayes' original book was altered by Stone and Parker just created Stone's skewed vision].  Stone was successful in destroying the Turkish justice image in the minds of generations of Americans.  Ask most any American [now thirty years after Stone made his movie] to picture a Turkish(or Islamic) prison or court room or justice system, and the one portrayed in Midnight Express is the one that is ingrained.  Coincidence or not, it should be noted that this humiliating portrayal of Islamic justice came at a time of increased Hollywood output of negative Islamic images and favorable Israeli ones(the unprecedented and universally viewed miniseries Masada).  To this day, Islam's portrayal in movies is considered horrendous by those who study it(Shaheen's 'Reel Bad Arabs').

Instead of having ANY sympathetic Muslim/Turkish characters, they ALL are beasts.  It turns out the real Billy Hayes actually made friends with several Turkish inmates but accepting Stone's reality means accepting this truth as a lie.  Constantly the Western inmates have more depth,..they play instruments, they sing, they constantly visibly show compassion that the Muslims lack, they even articulate in a courtroom why Western justice culture is superior to Islamic sense of justice.  The Muslims in the film are stoic, opportunistic, hypocritical, and, well,..evil.  They are portrayed as victims of their own culture, as the judge hangs his head down when Billy is castigating Islamic justice for its lack of mercy, and the judge seems sad when he replies that his hands are tied.  There is no reaction or inquisitiveness in the faces of the Turkish prosecutor or the others - the viewer sees them as programmed by their culture.  Just so the viewer isn't confused as to the root of what creates such a fiasco of justice, Stone purposefully puts Islamic prayer beads in the hands of reprehensible characters like the Turkish public defender, and makes sure that a mosque is the prominent structure occupying the frame as Billy is driven around the city by policemen.  Likewise, he hangs Christian symbols on the victims in the film.  The warden never attempted to rape Hayes, as the film depicts, nor did Hayes murder anyone.  Stone's manufactured murder of the raping warden may have been an effort to implant the idea that the resolution the [mostly Christian] viewers should expect between their culture and the grotesque monster of Islam will take the form of a violent showdown.

The differences between the book and the film is evidence that Stone possibly used the powerful vehicle of a ""true story"" to instigate prejudice against Turks/Muslims.  Billy Hayes, now 56 years old and living in LA, recently tried[in the Seattle Post] to correct Stone's portrayal of his book: ""The message of 'Midnight Express' isn't 'Don't go to Turkey', it's 'Don't be an idiot like I was, and try to smuggle drugs."" and, ""I loved the movie, but I wish they'd shown some good Turks. You don't see a single one in the movie, and there were a lot of them, even in the prison. It created this impression that all Turks are like the people in 'Midnight Express.'""",movies

1314,314,8602,"If anyone prior to this doubted that either Williams or Bridges could do fully fleshed out characters with dramatic gravitas, this movie answered that question once and for all. Boy, could the two of them do it all in the movies. Bridges plays an obnoxious radio tv talk guy who makes a life altering mistake on his show. Robin Williams plays Parry, the homeless man who in the circle of life is caught in the rays of what radiates out from that mistake. They will create something positive out of this but it is coming out of the darkest of the dark to do so. Either Williams or Bridges should have won the Oscar for this, perhaps both, but they did not. It did show the movie going world though that Bridges had been consistently underestimated up to that point and he began getting parts instead worthy of his talent. The female roles were fully realized by Mercedes Ruehl and Amanda Plummer and they are beacons for coming home and out of the darkness and into the light. One of my favorite movies with favorite performance from all four actors.

1321,321,5492,"This is a movie that some people will find boring and that some people will find very very funny.  I am part of the latter group.

Essentially, `Bottle Rocket' is about 3 young men.  1.) Anthony (Luke Wilson) - a somewhat caring, laid back and under-motivated dude.  2.)  His pal Dignan (Owen Wilson) - an extremely motivated - albeit misguided  - and overly energetic guy, who is perhaps a little clueless. And 3.) Bob - a guy who always wears Reservoir Dog-esque suits; Bob seems frequently annoyed by Dignan's antics but puts up with him because he is kind of lonely.

The plot of this movie is really not that important, and I fear that a too thorough description might be misleading.  Yes - the film revolves around the three friends' attempts at small crimes, but this is not a slap-stick comedy about burglaries gone awry (even though they are entirely inept and even though the burglaries are extraordinarily funny).  Rather, this is a very dry comedy that thrives on dialogue (vs. physical humor).  If you've seen writer/director Wes Anderson's other films (such as `Rushmore' and `The Royal Tenenbaums'), you know what I mean.

This movie is one of my all-time favorite comedies (and my favorite of the Anderson films) for two reasons.

1.  The characters are entirely likeable.  They're doofuses, but they are really sweet.  It's impossible not to root for them.  For instance, when they rob a local bookstore, they don't blast into it like a bunch of tough guys.  They are bumbling and apologetic - and yet, as giddy as can be.  I mean - they're really excited to be hanging out with each other and to be pulling off this heist.  It's almost like a bonding experience for them.  And this is the tone throughout the film.  Despite disagreements, they really care for each other.  Their playfulness (and quasi-innocence) is accentuated by the lighthearted soundtrack (which is also excellent).

2.  The delivery in this film could not be more subtle.  Let's contrast the humor in `Bottle Rocket' with the sort of humor exhibited by other contemporary comedians.  Take Will Farrell.  When he delivers a funny line, he's usually half naked, his eyes are bulging out of his head, and he shouts it at the top of his lungs so that everyone can hear him.  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with Will Farrell.  I mean, I personally don't find him that funny, but I know a lot of people who do.  I just want to use him as a point of contrast.  Now take this scene from `Bottle Rocket' and compare:

Dignan is in a ridiculous yellow jumpsuit on some sort of rundown moped and is talking to Anthony.  Bob's macho and not-so-nice older brother - Future Man - pulls up in a jeep and mocks Dignan's attire.  After Future Man drives away, Dignan is feeling pretty hurt.  Anthony tries to make him feel better and says something to the effect of, ""Come on, man.  Did you see what he was wearing?"" (Future man had on a waspy, pastel colored polo shirt.)  Dignan replies under his breath (I didn't even catch the line the first time I saw this movie) and in all seriousness, ""Yeah.  It was pretty cool...""  This is the sort of comedy I love.  It's not in-your-face.  It's barely on the radar.  If subtle humor likewise appeals to you, then chances are you will love `Bottle Rocket.'  Worth noting, for those of you who have seen `Royal Tenenbaums' and are expecting something more or less identical - `Bottle Rocket' is in the same vein of comedy - but is definitely more subtle and less ""colorful.""  I just want to warn you so that your expectations don't cloud your appreciation of this hilarious film.",movies

1327,327,5486,"Taxi Driver is a psychological trip through an extremely interesting character study. Leaving viewers mystified, Martin Scorsese has crafted a superb movie. The script is audacious, the cinematography is in your face and gritty, and Robert De Niro's holds up the movie on his very own.

Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a taxi driving nobody who has served in a Vietnam and goes to pornographic movie theaters, making small talk with the woman who sells the food and candy. The story never let's go off you (even the end will leave you haunted and wondering) and the lonesomeness of New York seen through Bickle is mesmerizing. It is filmed in such a way that allows you to see the world has the main character would, who thinks New York is covered with ""trash"". Travis Bickle also narrates the story, making it emotional and more than just a one-dimensioned story.

1331,331,4190,"I just got done watching this for the third time.  The first two times, I had seen it on TV, and kept getting interrupted.  Either by people talking so that I couldn't hear, or having to leave the TV and missing scenes.  So, when I finally got to sit down and watch this straight through, I was blown away like it was the first time.
This is one of those movies that you can watch no matter what mood you are in, and end up feeling good.  This DVD contains the best version of it, too.  There was an original and a special edition.  The special edition cut out the scene of Roy Neary (Dreyfuss) tearing up his yard and throwing dirt and stuff in his window for a scene of him breaking down in the bathroom.  Personally, I find the first scene to be more interesting and entertaining, but the second is more vital to the story because it shows that he thinks he's going nuts and so does his family.  But, not to worry because BOTH scenes are spliced into the movie.  Also, the SE had and extended ending of Neary in the spaceship which isn't spliced into this one.
This movie, no matter how many times you see it, holds you spellbound.  Everyone was brilliant in this.  Speilberg's directing, Dreyfuss's acting (his performance in Jaws was damn good, but nothing compared to this), Terri Garr's acting, John Williams' musical score (somebody give him a lifetime achievement award, or better yet, three), and Paul Schrader-that's right, Paul Schrader's-brilliant screenplay.  Yep, the man who brought you such masterpieces as Taxi Driver as wrote this.  Speilberg rewrote it so much, though (probably because it was too dark, as Schrader's work tends to be), and Schrader said he didn't want anything to do with the new script.  Regardless of who wrote it, it's perfect and entertaining as all hell.
You would think that a movie of this caliber, with such a climactic and intense ending, would lose it's power to leave you staring at the screen in awe, but it doesn't.  During the whole last half of the movie (the close encounter and the events leading up to it), I was not only riveted, I was anxious and nervous.  Just like the first time I saw it.  I was doing all those nasty habits I do when I get anxious or nervous, even though I KNEW what was going to happen.  That's how friggin POWERFUL this movie is.  Everyone knows the basic plot to this movie, but it doesn't matter.  It spins it web over you, and you can't help but get caught in it every time.
Now, about the DVD.  Whoever put this DVD together is almost as brilliant as the people who made the movie.  It's 11 deleted scenes show you everything that was taken out of the movie (the extending ending, etc.), and then some.  The 100 minute(!) documentary is fascinating, if it had been any shorter(like those twenty minute ones, or even worse, one of those 7 minute ""featurettes"") I would have been mad as hell.  Again, hats off to whoever made it.  It also includes a featurette called Watch the Skies, which I admit that I haven't got around to yet, because I've been busy with the other features, and of course watching the movie!  But even if the featurette wouldn't have been included at all, the documentary more than makes up for it.  The DVD also includes trailers, which no one really cares about usually, but I always get a kick out of them.  The best thing about this, though, is the restored picture and sound.  The Dolby 5.1 sounds even better than the original sound!!!  And the picture is a million times better than VHS!  Definitely a noticeable difference!!
Oh yeah, the reason for my title is of course because this movie makes you use your brain, but it also leaves you feeling good after you watched with wonder as the close encounter unfolded.
Let me just say that this is one of the best sci-fi movies.  Except most of it isn't a sci-fi movie, so you don't need to be a sci-fi nut to enjoy it!!  This DVD NEEDS to be in your collection!!!",movies

1333,333,7692,"It's been six years since I have run out of a movie theater angry and bewildered.
This review is really intended for the mature movie-goer. I say this because many of the young adults loved this movie and were having a blast.  I only wish I could have seen what they found so interesting. But hey, I gave it a go.  Even though the critics hate this movie(if you want a real laugh, check out Roger Ebert's review),  the trailer was intoxicating.
If you want to know, in depth what the movie is about..see another reviewer's review.  I'll just say here that the plot of an underground, highly classified colony of people, working on unnatural forms of DNA was exciting. When one little vial gets dropped, the computer system shuts the plant down, literally. Everyone is killed to contain the contamination.  The first 50 minutes were decent, but when really awful and unconvincing zombies jumped out of the woodwork, the movie could not redeem itself (think of zombies from knock-off flicks of the original ""Night of the Living Dead""). This is when 11 or more people, including ourselves walked out of the theater.
  There was rumor that this movie is based on a PC game of the same title.  I play many PC games and would appreciate if someone would email me and elaborate.  If this is true, that could be the reason why the younger crowd was so enthusiastic about this flick.
I give the movie two stars for suspense, a great initial plot, and choosing Milla Jovovich as the lead. I enjoy her acting, she is blossoming into a great actress.  In all, this movie felt like a combination of ""Aliens"", ""Ghosts of Mars"", ""Return of the Living Dead"", and ""Relic"".

1339,339,3535,"In 2005, we took a weekend trip from Baton Rouge, LA to Natchitoches, LA, where fifteen years earlier the filming of Steel Magnolias in 1989 remains about the biggest thing that ever happened. Having never seen the movie, we rented it as soon as we got back home. Everyone had a reason for watching it in two segments--mine was my sense that this was one of the ""cutest"" movies I'd ever seen, and I'd had quite enough ""cute"" lately, especially after sitting through Will Smith in ""Hitch"". The accents and the caricatures of the characters were all so thick that it reminded me of The Beverly Hillbillies, though more embarrassing than funny. One ""Hillbillies-like"" moment that pretty funny was the few non-female characters' effort to shoot some ""crows"" out of a tree so that they won't ""**** all over the reception"". Their creative use of a crossbow is a classic.

Sad to say there isn't much else classic in a story that is at the same time saccharine and maudlin. There was also some choppiness between scenes (as the movie was adapted from a play that never left the beauty shop). I can think of two scenes in particular--one where the town-big wig Clairee (played by the noted-Southern belle Olympia Dukasis) buys the local radio station so that she can do the color commentary on the local football games (the scene features the same guy filmed bare from the back waist-and-lower view as he walks in front camera in the locker room three times.) In another scene, the Darryl Hannah (hard to recognize) committed Christian character argues with her boyfriend over his repeated taking of the Lord's name in vain. Neither scene has any impact on the rest of the story.

Dolly Parton is her usual big hair, big smile, big **** self as the lead hairdresser. Shirley MacLaine has a very unsympathetic character as the Eatonton's (Julie and Sally, and family) ill-tempered neighbor. The male characters are more or less wasted, especially the estimable Sam Shepard, who spends most of the film underneath a car, or sitting lifelessly in front of a TV.

The movie improved from the seemingly endless wedding prep and wedding of the first half to the second half, which became more dramatic. Sally Field has a pretty good scene near the end, she and the story make you think a little about the motives of the main character (Julia Roberts as Shelby).

Overall, I thought that Steel Magnolias was a relatively embarrassing depiction of life in the beautiful town of Natchitoches, LA. Given that the locals seemed not to mind too much, I may be overreacting. They even showed us where the truck made an illegal left turn in the final scene.",movies

Probably the best of these is Take the Money and Run which spoofs the true crime documentaries of the time. Allen plays Virgil Starkwell, a hilariously inept career criminal whose life is one misadventure after another. Using ""testimony"" from people in Starkwell's life and cinema vierte style photography, Allen peppers the audience with hilarious sight gag after sight gag. Among my favorites:

1. In high school, Starkwell joins the marching band ... as a cello player. The image of Allen running up the street with chair and cello in hand, stopping for a moment to play a few bars, then getting up and running a few more feet in hysterically funny.

2. Starkwell invites his girlfriend (played by Janet Margolin of ""David and Lisa"") to dinner but doesn't have the money. He breaks into several parking meters. When he tips the maitre'd, he dumps several dollars in change into his hand and all over the floor.

3. Starkwell robs a bank, but the teller can't read the note he hands him, thinking that the word ""gun"" is ""gub.""

4. When entering prison, one of the guards frisks Starkwell, inducing peals of ticklish laughter.

Indeed, Take the Money and Run seems a lot more like a film by Allen's former colleague on Your Show of Shows, Mel Brooks, than like one of his later films. The story is just a framework for gag after gag -- most of which are unbelievably funny. Allen did some wonderful and deep character studies later in his career, but Take the Money and Run is a hilarious comedy that should stand among his best work.",movies
1351,351,6691,"""Roxanne,"" a 1987 film written by, and starring, the comic genius Steve Martin is yet another film from the fertile 1980's that more people should be happy to know.  It's based on the 100-year old French play ""Cyrano de Bergerac,"" by Edmond Rostand. And it costars the long-legged blonde Daryl Hannah, makes good use of Shelley Duvall, Fred Willard, and Michael J. Pollard in supporting roles, was directed by the talented Australian Fred Schepisi. It's set, supposedly, in a pretty Oregon skiing town; actually filmed in a pretty Canadian town; the cinematography presents us with many green and charming vistas.

Its plot follows the original.  C.D.(Charlie) Bales (Martin), (note he's got the same initials as the original), is the intelligent, engaging fire chief of the small town; he's got quite a lot going for him, but also, unfortunately, an extremely prominent nose.  But he's getting alone fine until astronomy student Roxanne (Hannah) comes to town on a cheap summer sublet.  She falls for one of Bales's employees, dumb but handsome Chris (Rick Rossovich) in a big way; but, fortunately, she doesn't really go for dumb.  Her friend Dixie (Duvall), tells her she wants Chris's looks with Charlie's brains.  And, for a while, that's what she gets, as Charlie writes Chris's love letters and dictates his dialogue.

Many critics have lauded Martin's extraordinary gift for physical comedy, but you've got to see it to believe it.  He opens the movie with an energetic strut across town, then has a wonderfully choreographed fight with two rude young male tourists: his tennis racket against their ski poles.  He also spends a lot of time climbing up and around houses and trees; and falls down from a tree, claiming he was abducted by aliens, as per a puzzling scene in the original play.  The movie also gets a gratifying amount of mileage out of  Charlie's fire department: there aren't too many movies that give the viewer any feel for what a character supposedly does to make a living.  One criticism: Dixie is not as young or beautiful as Roxanne, but does that mean she had to be turned into an asexual auntie type? Oh well.  Romantic comedies don't come much better than this.",movies

1357,357,5846,"For a very long time, this remained on my wish list. Despite its being held in high regard, I feared Fright Night would be a half-witted foray into my favorite genre (the vampire film) since it had a cheesy aura to it and was produced smack dab in the middle of a decade I have no wish to relive. I also was awaiting a rerelease of the Blu-ray version that came with extras: this never rematerialized, so now the Region A Blu-ray is fetching exorbitant prices (perhaps it is being mistaken for the Screenarchives version, which was limited to 3000 copies worldwide).

Sure enough, upon watching I found Fright Night replete with the worst of 1980s culture and topped with Cheez Whiz (the nightclub scene was particularly unbearable). Nonetheless, the special effects are both intentionally and unintentionally humorous, the story mildly creative (although predictable), and the 106 minutes not wasted. Stephen Geoffreys as ""Evil Ed"" was so over the top that he actually was a pleasure to watch, inciting laughter despite what passes as funny in the 21st century. And honestly, the special effects are still commendable for a pre-CGI world, right down to the uncomfortable custom contact lenses made for the vamped out actors. Considering that vampire films need to be graded on a curve, Fright Night remains a work worth watching, if only for some laughs.

The Region Free Blu-ray version (Dutch import) of Fright Night looks fantastic!

1359,359,2934,"I'm a true film aficionado. I have a collection that numbers more than 5,000 in my collection going back to the silent film days, and I have served as a film reviewer in several publications, so I feel qualified to offer my insights about this wonderful ensemble film based on the Herbert Ross film production of the Robert Harling play.

One must first understand that Steel Magnolias was the first film director Herbert Ross did following the death of his first wife, Nora Kaye, in 1987. He said in an interview that Nora was an exceptionally strong woman just like the women in Harling's play and screenplay and he felt that he could pay her no better tribute than to make Steel Magnolias the best film of his long and illustrious career in her honor. When Ross passed away in 2001 we lost perhaps one of the greatest directors of his generation. Steel Magnolias was nominated for three Academy Awards (unfortunately, a split vote between Shirley MacLaine and Julia Roberts robbed both of them a Best Supporting Actress Award), two Golden Globes (of which Julia Roberts won one for Best Support Actress over Sally Fields), A Chicago Film Critic's Award nomination for Shirley MacLaine (which she did not win), A People's Choice Award for Steel Magnolias as Best Dramatic Motion Picture (which it did win), and finally a BAFTA nomination for Best Supporting Actress for Shirley MacLaine (which she did not win). A handy tally of success to say the least. Steel Magnolias was the 5th from last movie Herbert Ross would direct before he passed away of heart failure.

If you're an ""Easter-egg hunter"" (quite literally in this instance), look for the playwright, Robert Harling himself, playing the part of  the minister at the Easter festivities (both at the beginning and end of the film), the ""Ouiser never did a religious thing in her life,"" joke in the church, and at the funeral. I won't go into too much detail with spoilers.

Many people love to rehash Steel Magnolias for the script, this actress or that actress, but the truth is that Steel Magnolias was one of those films that was just plain spontaneous combustion. It was the right screenplay, with the right director, one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled (that includes Tom Skerritt and Sam Shepard--who's a damned good playwright in his own right in addition to being a world class actor--put he and Dolly Parton together and it's pure magic!) and the enticing cinematography of the beautiful area surrounding the true backdrop of Robert Harling's original story, Natchitoches, Louisiana. About 6 years ago I was driving through the area and stopped to see if Natchitoches was as beautiful as it was in the movie and I can tell you it isn't. It's even more gorgeous than you see in the film! It's warm and caring community of people who were just as changed by Robert Harling's play and screenplay as some of you were! I strongly suggest you drop by, kick your feet up and stay awhile!

The one scene I will center on without too much spoiler alerts (turn your head! Turn your head!) is the funeral sequence. I've been known to write a story or two in my days and every time I see Steel Magnolias, the funeral sequence always impacts me emotionally, and I wish I could write half as well as this scene plays out.

Even though I know exactly what's going to happen (who am I fooling? I have the script memorized and mouth the words without making a sound!), I have NEVER had a movie, play or event in my life that takes me from one emotion and slams gears into the reverse direction so abruptly that you have NO choice but to react to both emotions you're feeling at the same time! In this case you can credit Sally Fields, Daryl Hannah (who does a sort of dorky blonde Jesus freak), and Olympia Dukakis grabbing the gear-shift on everyone's emotion by using Shirley MacLaine's grumpy Ouiser  character. If you've never seen it then I suggest you get your popcorn or snack ahead of time and take the phone off the hook. You really don't want anything to interrupt the dramatic rhythm of this sequence.

If you want to know what my biggest problem with this movie; it's the ending. Everything about my writing skills says it was a beautiful ending, but emotionally, I have this feeling deep inside my heart that I wish I could find out what happens to everyone.",movies

Instead of making this movie almost exactly the same as the origional, as most horror-movie-makers seem to do, this movie has a totally different setting to the first - a holliday resort in the bahamas!

Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) and her best friend and roommate Karla (Brandy) win a radio compition and win a holliday for four to the bahamas. Karla takes her boyfriend Tyrell (Mekhi Phifer) and Julie takes her new love interest Will (Matthew Settle). The arrive and check into their hotel (which I admitt, was a bit of an unrealistic point of the film as there are only five or six staff members and seemingly no other guests, however it is the ""off-season"").

Julie begins to relax, enjoying the luxury and relaxation of the hotel, but, unknown to Julie and her friends, the body count is rising and its not long before those awaited words ""I Still Know..."" appear and once again Julie must face the wrath of Ben Willis.

Just as good as the orgional, this movie is not one to miss. It is as scary as the orgional and a bit gorier too. This movie also features an appearance from Jack Black and Ray (Freddy Price Jr) is also back.

1365,365,6049,"Fright Night is an enjoyable horror.  Its fast paced simple story keeps you watching as to how a young teenager tackles the fact that a vampire has moved in next door to him.  Fright Night is a very predictable 80's horror flick with bubbly performances from its teenager stars and the over exaggerated acting from its adult leads.  Don't get me wrong, the acting IS acceptable for this type of film and works well.  Keeping to the theme of the film, strange things start to happen (for example): a coffin is seen brought into the house next door, a mysterious man is seen with a woman and a body in a bag is seen dragged out of the house.  Of coarse this all leads up to one thing, that there is a vampire living in the next house and the frightened tenager tries to warn everybody before the vampire kills again.  It not surprising what happens next, as the vampire visits and fights back (but for some strange reason) with comedic effect.

Fright Night does have a lot of ridiculous but humerous moments with 80's style make up and special effects.  The special effects however, are quite good and impressive for its time.  Eventhough this film is very enjoyable and a good Halloween flick, it does have a couple of flaws.  One is that the story is very simple and dreary, while the second is that some parts of the film could have been done better.

Overall, Fright Night is a forgetable film but it is very entertaining and fun to watch.  Its a film I would give 3 1/2 stars if I could.  So I gave it 3, as it will take me a while to watch again.",movies

Rule #1:  never, never go back into the secret, underground research facility after it has been sealed off because of cannibalistic zombies, rampant viruses, and a crazed, out of control, killer computer.  But in RESIDENT EVIL - APOCALYPSE, the big, bad Umbrella Corporation does just that.  And baaaaad things are released into Raccoon City.  Very bad things.

As with the original Resident Evil, RESIDENT EVIL - APOCALYPSE is a monster-mashing, gore-filled zombie flick which is unexpectedly entertaining.

1381,381,894,"I never saw this special during my childhood, which in retrospect was really too bad. Now that I have a four year old son, I love finding ""pre-Elmo"" Sesame Street productions for him to watch. This is a fun special - In a nutshell, thanks to Big Bird, the Sesame Street folks find themselves locked overnight in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. At this point, various characters start having their own adventures: Oscar becomes enamored with the museum's collection of ancient Greek statues, believing them to be beautiful ""trash"" because they are missing limbs, noses, heads, etc.; Bob is forced to thwart Cookie Monster's desire to eat a painting by Paul Cezanne and other works of art; Super Grover tries to make friends with a suit of armor, thinking that it's a real person; and Big Bird along with Mr. Snuffleupagus help a 4006 and one-half year old, cursed Egyptian boy (who presumably lives by day as a mummy in the museum) solve an ancient riddle so that he can transform into a star and live with his parents in the night sky.
Admittedly, the Egyptian portion of the special is a bit odd; they continually make reference to the ""demon"" (played by actor James Mason) that arrives at stroke of midnight to pose the riddle's question to the Egyptian boy, as well as Osiris (the god of the underworld) who poses the final challenge to the boy's ascension. I thought this segment was great, but I never thought I would hear the word ""demon"" uttered by Big Bird - Maybe they should start having him call Elmo a ""little red demon!"" (Just Kidding).

1396,396,7078,"Wow!  This is one case where I definitely wish that Amazon gave reviewers the option of rating both the film itself and the extras.

This is because while ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is just a slightly above average sequel, the extras on this DVD offer hours of entertainment and are worthy of four stars on their own and maybe even five.

Let's start with the movie and some background on its history.

First, with the possible exception of snuff films, there is no film genre that commands less respect than that of the video-game based-movie.

It's not without good reason either. If you think of the video game based movies you've seen, odds are they all s@#$ed majorly. ""Super Mario Brothers""? Awful. Van Damme's ""Streetfighter""? Mediocre at best. ""House of the Dead""? Dumb.

Which is why when ""Resident Evil"" appeared in theaters in 2002 it was something of a small miracle. Not only was the film not bad it was actually very good. Smart, sexy, stylish, ""Resident Evil"" was the rare video game film that transcended its roots to become a highly enjoyable movie-going experience for both diehard gamers and regular viewers.

It also helped to revitalize the zombie movie genre, kicking off a resurgence of zombie and zombie-esqe films that began with ""28 Days Later,"" the new ""Dawn of the Dead,"" and the Brit comedy ""Shaun of the Dead.""

That trend continues now with ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse,"" which picks up right where the first film ended.

The bad news? RE2 is not as good as it's predecessor. The good news? It's still pretty good.

Returning for this installment is Milla Jovovich as Alice, sole survivor of the first film's series of events. Also, along for the ride is the luscious Sienna Guillory as S.T.A.R.S. officer, Jill Valentine, a name that will be familiar to fans of the ""Resident Evil"" video games. It's worth noting also that Guillory's resemblance to her videogame counterpart is so striking it's almost scary.

Other game characters also make their appearances here although some fans may be dissappointed that they are not featured as prominently.

Part of what made the first film work so well was the sure and inventive direction of Paul W.S. Anderson(""Mortal Kombat"", ""Aliens Vs. Predator""). Anderson's obvious love of video games seems to result in better than average film adaptations of them when he directs.

Anderson didn't helm this installment but new director Alexander Witt still manages to pull of some solid and occasionally stunning action sequences in this film. The church standoff, involving Alice and a trio of Lickers is especially memorable. Ditto Alice's run down the side of a skyscraper near the film's climax.

I'm only giving this film three stars though because it's flaws keep it from rising to masterpiece or even superb levels. Those flaws include:

Poor attention to characters - Though ""Resident Evil"" also boasted an ensemble cast, the writing and direction there were sharp enough to ensure that certain characters emerged as standouts. This is not the case here, where the ensemble just isn't balanced properly. Even Jovovich and Guillory don't get enough screen time and they are supposed to be the stars.

Not enough zombies - For a film that is supposed to be, at it's core, a zombie film, this movie offers far too few shots of the undead. When we do seem them they are often shot in shadowed, blurred slow motion.

Mike Epps - Mike, I loved you in the ""Friday"" sequels but if you're not careful you're destined to wind up as the Trimspa version of fellow Black comedian-actor Anthony Anderson i.e. the go to guy when a movie requires an annoying Black comic sidekick. Note to Hollywood: If you want to include Black characters in mainstream films try to make sure that they're well-rounded and have depth instead of the same tired, loudmouthed stereotypes we've been seeing for generations.

At least the movie explains why slim-framed Alice is able to pull off increasingly amazing feats of strength. Seems her exposure to the T-Virus is slowly evolving her to the point where she manifests superhuman powers. Where this storyline will take us, I have no idea.

Now for the extras.  Simply put, this DVD offers an impressive array of special features that will keep viewers busy long into the night.  You get, three, count 'em three commentaries, 20 deleted scenes, a six-part making of feature, and host of other goodies that amount to everything AND the kitchen sink.

Most interesting is the feature on real-world corporate malfeasance.  Rarely does schlock entertainment actually try to make you think.

I also love the fact, that this DVD release contains both widescreen and full screen versions of the movie.  The ongoing trend of many studios releasing two different formats on separate discs fails to acknowledge many fans do like to have both versions and can't afford to shell out for the same DVD twice in order to have them.

While this is a great package there's no getting around the fact that the movie its wrapping is just a bit above okay.  In the end, I feel that movies like ""28 Days Later"" and the new ""Dawn of the Dead"" have raised the bar for zombie and zombie-like movies.  Anything coming afterward has really gotta step up its game.  ""Resident Evil:Apocalyse"" just didn't quite meet that challenge.

One thing I can say is that this film left me curious to see what happens in ""Resident Evil 3."" And if Sienna Guillory comes back for that one, consider my advance ticket already bought.",movies

I chose the Director's Cut as if it is what Spielberg envisioned and not the studios, then that I what I want to see. The theatrical version clocks in at 135 minutes, while the Special Edition clocks in at 132 minutes and the Director's Cut at 137minutes.  The Audio for all 3 versions is DTS MA 5.1 lossless audio for English and French, while the Spanish viewer gets lossless Dolby True HD 5.1.  Since both lossless codecs are very good and significantly better than any lossy audio codec, I do not believe that anyone could tell the difference, but more on the audio later on.

VIIDEO....The cover of the Blu Ray says that the film has been remastered and I believe it.  While I had not seen the film in many years and do not own the Standard Def DVD and, thus, have nothing to compare it with, all I can say is that the video transfer looks beautiful in all ways.  The colors are just gorgeous with the daylight sky shots a rich and smooth blue.  The blacks are as true to black as I have seen in the past with great details easily showing in these dark and shadowy areas.  At no point in watching the Director's Cut did I see any artifacting nor stair-stepping which would have been prominent is many of the wide angle landscape shots.  The video transfer absolutely deserves the 5 stars I gave it.

AUDIO...Watched in the lossless DTS MA HD 5.1 and the balance of audio levels between the dialogue and John Williams music score was exceptionally good.  The music score is spread quite nicely across the front stage with stereo imaging of the instruments nicely placed.  During the first  half of the movie I was a touch disappointed that the rear channels were not used that often for front to rear pans or foley FX.  However, the second half of the film wakes things up with several uses for the rear channels and discreet channeling of the audio fx to both left and right.  It is here where your LFE sub channel will come alive and if you have a good sub and it is set properly, it will certainly get a musical workout.  I rate the overall  audio with 4 stars.

EXTRAS...While I have read that there were several extras on other releases of this film,  this particular release had no 'making of' documentaries or commentaries.  The only extra, which I did not use or try, is a special pop up called 'In Movie A View from Above (Editor's Fact Ttrack'.  This feature pops up an icon, depending upon which version of the film you are watching that provides a fact or two about why a specific scene was cut or added back in as well as other trivia I suppose.  At least there were no previews for other movies taking up room on the Blu Ray.  I hate to pay for advertising and an even greater compression of the feature film than it needs to be.

All in all, this is a classic film with brilliant work by Richard Dreyfus, a superior actor, and a great transfer on Blu Ray.  I would encourage you to purchase it.
I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase or not.

A warning to parents - the DVD has scenes you may not have seen in the tv version (a couple of them gratuitous-a scene showing nudity in the pool of his wife and children and the hanging of the baker); the scene with Joseph and Potiphar's wife does a great job of showing just how difficult it must have been for Joseph to stand firm in his principles (would be a little mature for young audiences).",movies

1424,424,4363,"""Stepmom"" is an arresting existential drama about the lives and times of a fragmented couple(Susan Sarandon and Ed Harris) with two kids. He has a fiance (Julia Roberts) who has to deserve and then to win respect and affection from these two sensitive children whose unerring behavior is perpetual motive of comparison respect her. In order to melt this emotional iceberg, Roberts who is a successful professional photographer, will have to fight very hard to occupy her own place in the new state of things.

With all these available dramatic premises, the expectations were too high. But the screenwriters bet for a tearful approach in the third movement of the play when a sudden twist of fate will intend to make us aware about the importance of the familiar values, above any serious conceptual difference between the new visitor and the original mother.

1429,429,5622,"but, if you've got the stomach and a curiosity about the non-Disney side of the human personality, this dark, insightful, and yes, violent, tale is for you.  What always gets me about this movie is DeNiro's performance.  DAMN!!!  He IS Travis Bickle.  That's how amazing his acting (in this) is-yet we know he isn't.  This is the 'Master of Puppets' (Metallica' best, and most powerful, album) for DeNiro.  The power of his performance here is beyond description.  How he got from 'Taxi Driver' to where he is today would make for another 'dark journey' movie...  By the way, for those reviewers who don't understand why he doesn't go to jail at the end, think about the kind of people he killed-the kind the police would just as soon kill themselves if they could get away with it.  He was doing the police a favor, in a weird sort of way.  Plus this is inner city NYC-nobody cares about these types of people anyway in 'this part of town'-you're on your own.  The making Travis out to be a hero was on purpose-to show how society has a twisted sense of rewarding the 'wrong people'-GET IT???  As for the color of the blood at the end, you should have watched the 'making of' part of the DVD-They talk about how the negatives for the original had deteriorated so much that they were not able to be saved.  If you just plain didn't like it, well, you can see you're in the minority.  Even if it's too violent for you, I don't see how you could ignore DeNiro's performance-it's why acting was invented, or Scorsese's (and crew) amazingly thick vibe that so perfectly complements DeNiro's tour de force performance.

1439,439,4658,"Like a large percentage of Arnold Schwarzenegger's work, this is a film with a strong fantasy/altered reality element to it that works quite well overall, despite at times seeming too beholden to action formulae, rather than being willing to take the fantastic risks it looks like it's going to.  John McTiernan's 1993 LAST ACTION HERO was roundly criticized at the time of its release for being overblown and not delivering the goods that were expected from a $70-90 million (a lot of money at the time) film.  It came in the wake of TERMINATOR II, a hard act to follow certainly, and also just after McTiernan's financially disappointing MEDICINE MAN - but with his big hit THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER still reasonably fresh.  More importantly, the director had gotten his big break with PREDATOR, which was an important step in Arnold's rise to superstardom; this was their first (and to date only) reteaming.  I suppose expectations were higher than any film could deliver, and when the film failed to ignite either critics or the box office (to be fair, it was always in the mighty shadow of JURASSIC PARK), the word ""flop"" started to get bandied about, and the cynics started to wonder of the star's decade of dominance was coming to an end.

The naysayers were partly right; this was the first sign of Arnold faltering, though it would take another five years before he really started to lose his lustre; and it wasn't his best film by a long shot, though it certainly looks pretty good now in comparison with some of his later, even more expensive and less successful outings like END OF DAYS.  Basically the idea here is that we start off watching ""Jack Slater III"", an Arnold Schwarzenegger cop film in a sort of alternate reality that's pretty close to ours, and then our eventual sidekick character, an adolescent kid named Danny (Austin O'Brien) is revealed as watching the flick in a crumbling and decrepit old NYC movie palace.  The early scenes here are very evocative - Danny is watching the film alone, friends with the old projectionist Nick (Robert Prosky), and his mother (Mercedes Ruehl) worries about him skipping school and only being interested in movies and hanging out with the weird old guy.  Very Zemeckis-Spielberg.  But soon we're in different territory as Nick gives Danny a ""magic ticket"" that he got from Houdini himself, tearing it and releasing the magic that allows Danny to be catapulted into the movie world of Jack Slater (now starring in the 4th installment of the franchise, brand-new and not even officially premiered yet).

So the ""real world"" kid falls in with the completely fake Slater, who is of course unaware that he's a movie character.  There are some pretty good jokes early on - Slater's boss, the blustery Lt Dekker (Frank McRae) gets so angry and abusive if his regular berating of Slater that he becomes completely incomprehensible; Slater never runs out of bullets and never hurts himself; there are cameos from several costars of Arnold's from previous films; cartoon characters work as cops; etc.  But the satire on action movie conventions is fitful and often seems to be used just to fill in the blanks between ""real"" action sequences, and the developing friendship between Danny and Jack, while sweet, just doesn't feel as significant as it should.  Perhaps a Spielberg would have made it too shmaltzy, but here you're left wondering just how Danny really feels about the whole experience once it's over.

Charles Dance does a great one-eyed villain (with a different glass eye for every occasion) and Tom Noonan plays the other villain, something of a slasher-movie type monster called ""Ripper"".  Anthony Quinn is around as a bit as Dance's employer who stupidly keeps making idiomatic malapropisms in the manner of Biff in Back to the Future; we know his minutes are numbered from the get-go.  Art Carney has a nice little cameo as Slater's ""favorite second cousin"" and Bridgette Wilson is there to lend some serious hotness.  There are some nice little specific movie references - Olivier's Hamlet transformed into Jack Slater's (""to be, or not to be...not to be"" as he blows up the castle behind him) and Ian McKellen doing Bergman's death - but overall the satire is outweighed by action setpieces, and the film has a rather slapped-together feel to it, unsure as to what to do other than lumber towards a big splashy finish.

Still, it's mostly fun, and I have to say that I wasn't as bothered by O'Brien as I was on seeing it when new.  I think Arnie was fairly into it also, and that's important.  Probably average for his ouevre, and for all it's faults, another reminder as to why he really was not just the biggest but the best American action star of his era: he had the best talent around him, and he rarely seemed to take his image as seriously as people like Seagal, Stallone and Norris did.",movies

1441,441,2706,"Released in late 1986, ""No Mercy"" stars Richard Gere as a Chicago cop who travels to New Orleans to track down a blond (Kim Basinger) who is linked to the murderer of his beloved partner. The film features a great love-to-hate villain, Losado, played by Jeroen Krabb; a notable survival-in-the-swamp sequence wherein Gere & Basinger are handcuffed to eachother; and an action-packed showdown in an old city hotel.

Actually, I could do without the hotel showdown, as it comes off too cartooney and contrived (like when one of the villains barges right through a wall with his rifle -- Why sure!), but I suppose it can be accepted on the grounds of Western-like artistic license.

There's loads of foul language but I found it realistic for these types of individuals in such critical situations. So I didn't mind it too much but my wife took (minor) offense.

Gere's still relatively young here (36). I realize many hate him, but I'm a fan of quite a few of his pictures, e.g. ""The Mothman Prophecies"", ""King David"" and ""An Officer and a Gentleman"". Kim Basinger doesn't do much for me personally, although she's certainly pretty and her acting is effective here. I know it's a matter of taste but ""No Mercy"" provides zero 'babe appeal' for me.

The film was shot in Chicago and Louisiana (and some parts in NC).

The score is moving despite the dated mid-80s electronic drums.

FINAL WORD: It's hard to put into words why I like this film to the extent of writing a review. It's nothing exceptional, but it somehow 'works' and gets better with repeat viewings. I bought the dvd a year & a half ago and have watched it three times since, which is something I rarely (if ever) do. I think what attracts me is that it's more than just a mindless cop/action flick, although it has the thrills if that's all you're looking for. ""No Mercy"" has something to say about love, loyalty, courage, justice, freedom and happiness, but it's smart enough to not spell it all out. Hence, not only is the picture enjoyable to watch due to the 'movie  magic' but it can also leave you contemplating.

The film runs 106 minutes.

1444,444,5602,"""You talkin' to me?""

With those four words, a legend was born.

What more is there to say about Taxi Driver that hasn't already been said? Disturbing, gritty, dark, compelling... masterpiece.

Robert De Niro stars as Travis Bickle, who describes himself as ""God's lonely man"". He takes a job driving taxis because he can't sleep nights, and if he's going to roam New York City anyway, he might as well get paid for it. From here on out, the movie takes us INSIDE Travis's head. His thoughts, his feelings, his obsessions, his loneliness. This is why, although he is portrayed as a nut, the audience sort of feels for Travis (for the most part anyway). The viewer understands what is making him want to violently lash out at the messed-up world. We witness firsthand why he wants someone to ""just flush this city right down the [edit] toilet!""

This movie portrays mid-70's NYC to a T. The hookers, pimps, pushers, they're all here, and they're all chipping away at Travis Bickle's sanity (what little he has left, anyway).

The two most pivotal points in the movie: when Travis finally meets an attractive woman named Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) and asks her out on a date, but screws it up badly... although Travis meant well (he honestly didn't know any better), Betsy decides to just ignore him. This is a situation almost all of us have been in, whether or not we took someone to a movie like that, and that only helps us sympathize with Travis.

The other pivotal point is when Travis meets a 12-year-old prostitute named Iris (Jodie Foster). Travis sees Iris as tied down, being stripped of her innocence and youth, and that he has to save her by any means necessary.

The best thing about Taxi Driver is that it doesn't give any easy answers. Is Travis Bickle a hero or a nutbar? And, most importantly, was Travis dead in the last scene, or is that really what happened? It is left up to the viewer to decide.

So, if you haven't seen this movie yet, see it (if you're not faint of heart, anyway). It's a classic, it made Bobby De Niro a legend, and it's a great movie to slap ""Torque"" in the face with.

1446,446,7318,"The first fifteen minutes of the film are mesmerizing as young Joan of Arc is explored with her leanings towards enjoying confession and how she got her calling. A fascinating openning.
The only justification for the two stars I gave it.
Then unfortuneately, Mila Jovanivich takes over as the grown up Joan of Arc.  A very unfortunate casting choice. She runs the gamut of acting emotions  ranging  from a to b.  She gawks in amazement and her eyes bulge with absolutely nothing underneath. She is unconvincing and annoying in this role.
To add to this, her hair color changes from scene to scene. One scene she is blonde then she is brunette. Is this to distract us from her acting? Is this a God given hair color change? Or is it a vision from  Clairol?

Faye Dunaway and John Malkovich give good performances but they are not in enough of the movie to save it. By the time Dustin Hoffman shows up at the end, who even cares?
 Aside from the great opening, the hole mishmash shows no insight into Joan of Arc.  After the fascinating opening--the ball is dropped and that is the director and lead actor's fault.  Lead a nation in battle? This woman can't lead a movie.

First of all, the ground-based subplot with Glenn Close as the vice president is boring and just detracts from the movie's momentum.  Also, it's kind of interesting that the evil Secret Service agent tries to kill Harrison Ford at the end, even though none of the other villains are left to expose him and he could walk away without ever being suspected.  There was some scene that actually explained WHY that guy was betraying the president, but thanks to some boneheaded editing it was cut out of the movie and that character was reduced to just another stock villain.  In addition, almost all of the action sequences are sick mockeries of reality.  Granted, I can sort of go along with having that much random automatic gunfire on an airplane without losing cabin pressure.  But it's just ridiculous when the characters stand next to a big open hatch without getting sucked out into the sky and their hair just blows in the wind like they're standing in front of a movie studio fan.  And the most unintentionally funny moment has to be when the plane crashes-- the whole shot, one of the most awful CG effects I've seen in a big studio movie, is pathetic and kind of sad.  I don't understand why this film has been so successful and popular, especially since we've all seen MUCH better action movies from directors like James Cameron and John McTiernan.  Cameron could make a better movie than this standing on his head.  Sure the DVD is a nice way to show off your sound system, but there's something seriously wrong if you consider that reason enough to go out and buy this movie...",movies
1455,455,6070,"Although ""Fright Night"" is considered to be an 80's classic, it is actually more than that. The film is an endearing and energetic homage to horror cinema especially the Hammer productions and the Universal horror cycle. Yes, the film has a humorous tone, but it is not campy nor is it trashy. It is a competently written, stylishly directed and wonderfully performed horror film which features amazing special effects by Richard Edlund (back when effects depended on imagination, not processor speed) and a truly original and haunting score by Brad Fiedel. But the highlight of this movie has to be Roddy McDowall's performance as Peter Vincent (which is Tom Holland's tribute to actors PETER Cushing and VINCENT Price) as his portrayal of the fading horror star who hosts a second rate late night horror show who reluctantly becomes a real life vampire killer, is both terrific and arguably his career best. With an atmosphere that is nothing short of a horror buff's dream, good performances and a terrific, special-effects laden climax, this is a horror classic that is unmissable for fans of horror and especially vampire films. *The Region 1 dvd features a gorgeous anamorphic transfer, but is sadly missing the 5.1 sound remix that is featured on the region 2 edition, however both features the excellent trailer, which is also restored*.",movies

1457,457,3423,"Revolutionary in its time but appearing somewhat dated now, ""Easy Rider"" was the ultimate road trip: two bikers on a cross-country ride from the west coast to Mardi Gras in New Orleans after scoring big in a drug deal.  Produced and directed by, and starring Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda, and almost stolen by a then-unknown named Jack Nicholson playing a hippie lawyer, ""Easy Rider"" follows its two heroes across some of the most stunning scenery in the Southwest as they head towards Louisiana in search of ""freedom"", whatever that means.  ""Easy Rider"" not only brings us two (or three, counting Nicholson) of society's dropouts, we also meet a community of hippies, some narrow-minded small-town lawmen, and some rednecks in Louisiana who seem to have a more-than-passing relationship to Neanderthals.  We wonder if the film's perhaps unwitting message is that the search for meaningless ""freedom"" results in meaningless and wanton death and destruction.  More than any film of its time, ""Easy Rider"" caught the mood of the late 1960s in America and the fear of the ""establishment"" for society's rebels.  It may be of its own time, but its timeless rejection of mindless conformity echoes down to us.",movies

1459,459,9686,"Many like to laugh at Charles Bronson(myself included) because of his typecasting in 80s vigilante style action flick where he's usually portrayed as a senior citizen taking out the scum of the earth.  You won't be laughing at him in Hard Times.  Bronson made good movies, played good roles(see The Great Escape for another good example).  Hard Times is one good movie.  Bronson is the textbook definition of ""tough guy"".  He plays a street fighter in the 30s who doesn't say much, but can knock the taste right out of your mouth.  Basically, it's the Bronson version of Every Which Way But Loose, minus the laughs and the ape.  Watch him beat the snot out of guys who think they're tougher than nails, and woo Jill Ireland in the process.  Watch James Coburn give another great performance(as usual).  Watch the movie, man!!  It's astounding that Bronson was 54 when he did this.  54!!!  He's solid muscle in this film, you'd have to be crazy to want to fight the guy!  Vin Diesel?  Russell Crowe?  Amateurs!  Tough guy wannabees!  You won't see them looking like this and kicking tail when they're 54, that's for sure.  It may be an all but forgotten film now, but thank god for dvd.

1462,462,9770,"My twenty-four month old son was familiar with Elmo from ""Elmo's World,"" the fifteen minute segments that air during ""Sesame Street."" When we originally played this for him around eighteen months, he wouldn't watch it. It must have been too realistic for him, with Elmo's character being fleshed out a little more than on his show segments. There is also a plot with this, whereas the show simply introduces various simple concepts. Now he will sit and watch the entire movie, which runs barely more than an hour. His favorite part (who knows why) is Big Bird getting stuck in the trash can. This has little or nothing to do with the plot, though it serves to illustrate how well the folks at Sesame Street understand the mind of a child. I really have no qualms about letting my children watch Sesame Street because I know they are in very capable hands. There are learning lessons throughout, presented with the usual Sesame Street flair. The movie is also fairly entertaining for adults, with some decent songs. There seems to be less humor with this one than with other Sesame Street and Elmo productions, but that can be overlooked.",movies

The writers covered all the major bases on this one. It's a movie I can just sit down, relax and watch over and over again. And really, it's the perfect capper to the whole 80's generation of quality, fun action movies. It's a tribute sealed with a kiss and a hell of a good time.

1466,466,8264,"This highly implausible but irresistibly fun suspense thriller has lots to recommend it, starting with its novel premise involving a famous fashion photographer who begins to see murders as they happen--through the murderer's eyes (this same premise is also responsible for some of the film's lovably ludicrous moments).

Dunaway is the photographer, and her performance--as usual--elevates the material tenfold, even though she is hardly at her best here. But will Faye let bad styling and unflattering camera angles get in the way of her customary dedication to the role? Never!

Among the film's other assets are all the time-capsule location shots in Manhattan, the now-quaint disco soundtrack, the Helmut Newton-style ""photo session scenes"", and a strong supporting cast which includes Tommy Lee Jones as a homicide detective who becomes romantically involved with the titular Miss Mars.

The plot at times stretches believability to ludicrous heights, such as when Dunaway, ""seeing"" a murder in progress, drives a car through the streets of Manhattan, even though she's effectively blind, screaming ""Donald!"" before finally crashing through a show window (how did she manage all those turns? From memory?)

But unintentional camp does not hurt ""the Eyes of Laura Mars"" one bit--in fact, it just makes it all the more delicious.

Not sure why it's so pricey...I would say if you like Dunaway and late 70's disco/glam/horror, you should probably add this one to your collection.",movies
1467,467,6839,"Not as good as I hoped or wanted. The movie is extremely well done. Well acted and directed and Conroy also wrote the screen play. I guess my objection is with Conroy both with this film, this book and some of his others, like the Great Santini. While he does a great job of honestly describing his horrific childhood experiences, I don't care for his Pollyanna, whitewash type endings. It is essential that we come to terms with our issues but that doesn't necessarily mean giving a mea culpa to those responsible all the time, especially if they are not repentant or own their crimes. The ending line that ""In families, there is no crime that can't be forgiven"" is particularly disturbing. I don't think that's true at all. And I think Conroy's tendency to always wrap things with a Rodney King-like bow, doesn't work very well and ruins the impact of his truly courageous work. But looking at Streisand is always pleasant.",movies

1472,472,5450,"I have purchased and viewed all of Wes Anderson's films in the past month or so and I have got to say that I am thoroughly impressed. Rushmore, probably his most popular and acclaimed film, is an interesting story focusing on one character (very uncharacteristic of Anderson), Max Fischer. The Royal Tenenbaums, in my opinion, is TECHNICALLY his best achievement to date. The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and The Darjeeling Limited were both solid entries that I thought were great despite a lack of a certain something (still trying to figure it out). Fantastic Mr. Fox was an extremely well done stop-motion film adapting a story from Roald Dahl. My FAVORITE however is his debut film, Bottle Rocket.

I have now seen Bottle Rocket three times (in the past like 2 months) and on the third viewing, I decided to take some notes. What resulted was a 13-page in depth analysis of the themes and threads pumping through the heart of the film. My favorite aspect of Bottle Rocket is the character development. The character, Dignan, I believe is the most completely realized character of any of Wes' films and possibly the most tragic. Loneliness is the most prominent theme in the film, Dignan being the vehicle for the theme. Through my intense note taking, I was able to find some things that some people may not have picked up on.

Observations: After *successfully* breaking Anthony out of a voluntary hospital, Dignan and Anthony take a bus back home. On the bus, as soon as Anthony begins to talk about his emotional disturbances, Dignan switches the subject because he is uncomfortable talking about emotional problems.
""You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and CRAIG."" - Dignan. The fact that Dignan uses a first name probably signifies that Craig is the step-father i.e. daddy issues.
Throughout the film, Dignan tries to cultivate a relationship with his former employee Abe Henry, whom he looks up to as a father figure.
Dignan recruits Anthony and Bob into his ""team"", brother figures. The film depicts Anthony's sibling and Bob's sibling, but never shows or mentions Dignan having siblings. Only child = loneliness.
Dignan is very much a child trapped in the body of a control freak/army commander type guy. He throws tantrums but at the same time has the urge to be in control of every situation at all times. Anthony and Bob, unfortunately for Dignan, have a much different attitude towards their heists, theirs being more laid back and only semi-committed. Wes even shows us this through the characters haircuts. Dignan has a short hair cut and is even at one point mistaken as being in the army because of it. Anthony and Bob both have long hair that further shows their more laid back attitude. While Dignan plans out their heists to the last detail, Anthony is usually drawing while Bob is wrapped up in his brother.
Also a very minute detail I picked up on was the number of the motel room they stayed in. The room number is 212. This possibly suggests that the two '2s' are Anthony (who has Inez) and Bob (who has Futureman) and the lone '1' in the middle is Dignan. Also the adress of the Lawn Wranglers headquarters is 2215. Again, the '2s' are Anthony and Bob, the '5' is the Lawn Wranglers crew, and the lone '1' is again, Dignan.
""He thought he had a team, turns out to be a man alone. Now, that's tough now. Real tough."" - Mr. Henry speaking of Dignan. This totally captures Dignan up to that point in the movie and really foreshadows what happens during the final heist where he is let down by his entire crew and in turn is the only one who is punished for the 'attempted' crime.
The ending is very bittersweet. On one hand, Dignan is in jail but on the other, it seems like he is growing up. He makes belt buckles while in prison and tells Anthony and Bob that they could give them to Mr. Henry (who totally used Dignan to get closer to Bob and ultimately robs his house) and Apple Jack (who was caught at the scene but the charges were dropped because of his medical condition). He also jokes to Bob and Anthony about an escape plan which shows that he has accepted his fate. This is truly a coming of age story.

I could continue to go on about the analysis (and trust me, I COULD), but I want to touch on other areas of the film. First of all, the acting is absolutely spectacular. Owen Wilson's portrayal as Dignan is one of the most 'real' performances I have ever seen. It definitely helps that he co-wrote it with Anderson. Luke Wilson was also great as Anthony. There is one scene that really shows his talent. It is when he and Dignan are stuck on the side of the road after their car breaks down and Dignan refers to Inez as the ""housekeeper"". The look in Luke's eyes after he says that is actually kind of chilling. That takes skill. Robert Musgrave was definitely well suited for Bob and his performance is definitely on par with Owen and Luke but he was just given less material to work with than them. James Caan gives a very unique performance as Abe Henry. It was an odd but effective choice. AND YOU CAN'T FORGET KUMAR! Nothing makes me laugh more than when Dignan walks in on Kumar sitting on a couch while he should be cracking a safe.

Style wise, this is probably Wes Anderson's least ""Wes Anderson"" film. After Bottle Rocket, he really defined his style and stuck with it for the rest of his career. The cinematography by Robert Yeoman is simply superb and he manages to craft some stunningly beautiful shots. The music by Mark Mothersbaugh is indeed effective while the choice of already recorded music by Anderson is great. I found that ""Seven and Seven is"" by Love and ""2000 Man"" by The Rolling Stones define the scenes that they are played in and Anderson continued to burn scenes into our memories through his use of music in the rest of his films.

Making a long story short (too late), Bottle Rocket is in my top 10 films of all time. All the characters are just so rich and fleshed out that I find it irresistible to come back and continue to watch and enjoy there little quirks and mannerisms. I just find it amazing that all of the newcomers (Wes, Owen, Luke, and Bob Musgrave) met each other (obviously Owen and Luke didn't meet up, haha), created this masterwork, and now are all famous and successful (not so much Bob). This film gets my absolute highest recommendation if you have yet to see it. I urge you to watch it multiple times though so you can really catch the genius and depth of the characters. Also, check out Wes Anderson's other movies, especially The Royal Tenenbaums, which also delves deep into it's characters and is considered by many to be a near masterpiece.

On a final note, I also CANNOT WAIT for Moonrise Kingdom to come to my town. When I found out that it was initially only being released in New York and Los Angeles, I almost lost it. I have since cooled down and decided to appreciate the films I already have by him to their fullest before worrying about Moonrise Kingdom.

Thank you for your time.",movies

While it isn't overly scary, they do a great job on make-up with the zombies.  The plot is very easy to follow and keeps you on the edge of yours seat the whole time.  There are some great performances by the 2 lead roles, and the movie keeps a mysterious, dark undertone throughout the movie like is felt in the video game.  If you enjoy the video game you are going to love this movie, although it is hardly even loosely based on the video game.  But since this is coming out to video soon, this is a great movie to rent and have fun with.

1475,475,5841,"High school student, Charlie Brewster is a horror movie nerd and occasionally stays up late to watch his favorite show, titled Fright Night, which is hosted by his hero, Peter Vincent. One night, while spying on a beautiful woman having sex with his new neighbor, Jerry Dandrige, Charlie comes to the conclusion that he's a vampire after seeing his inhumane sharp fingers and seeing him drag a coffin into the basement.

Charlie tries to convince everyone from his adorably cute girlfriend, Amy; to his mom, Judy; to his annoying friend, Ed, and even the police that Jerry is a vampire, but they all think he's bluffing and that all the horror movies have finally gone to his head. After causing so much trouble, Jerry confronts Charlie one night and threatens to make him the next victim. When his friends and family won't believe him, Charlie turns to his idol, the washed up, has-been, Peter Vincent as a last resort. Can Charlie manage to prove to everyone that Jerry Dandrige is a vampire or will his convictions lead to his last stand?

Overall: I don't know if it's necessary to classify Fright Night as a horror, but maybe more of a thriller. It lacks true scares, but it has its creepy moments and delivers to a T in the entertainment department. It has its comical moments, but for the most part it's a gripping story that pulls you in within the first 10 minutes and keeps you captivated until the end. They couldn't have picked a better person than Chris Sarandon to play the role of Jerry Dandrige. He's got the smooth looks, an easy going tone in his voice, and a sly personality that makes him the perfect, dangerous vampire. Stephen Geoffreys, who commonly got the role of the nerdy kid back in the day pulls off the annoying, pesky, nerdy friend of ""Evil Ed"" really well. The make-up effects that went into giving the vamps their true form in this movie are extremely impressive and definitely give a meaning to the word, creep. Fright Night also has a great soundtrack, with the most notable piece being the captivating instrumental version of Come To Me by Brad Fiedel. A similar movie by the name, Lost Boys would make its way out 2 years later and was just as amazing as Fright Night. Overall, Fright Night is a treat as a whole and one of the best and most popular ""horror"" vampire flicks to ever be made. Awesome plot, spectacular performances, grade A effects, amazing soundtrack. This movie has it all. You can't be a horror/thriller fan and not enjoy Fright Night",movies

Sometimes Trend Micro is listed in the top ten antivirus software programs and more often not.  It seems to depend on the methodology used to rate these programs, and of course on which set of rating one can trust.  But they all seem to agree that Trend Micro is great in threat detection.

I've found that both the email and phone support for Trend Micro are great, and a good tutorial would also be useful.  What I like about the program is its ease of use and the fact that it doesn't do anything that I find annoying such as trying to insist on presence of a toolbar for example.  It's easy to forget about the program and just feel confident that it's working.  The automatic updates and scans are excellent.

A big concern is whether one's antivirus program slows down the system.  Trend Micro doesn't slow me down more than anything else I've tried but I have never used one of the truly expensive antivirus programs that are touted as better in this regard.  My judgment is that Trend Micro is fast in its price category in which I am familiar.

This software does not offer everything.  It does not offer full Web protection or adequate protection against spam, a constant thorn in anyone's side.  It's not Virus Bulletin Certified 100% for Windows XP or Vista.  But the antivirus protection gets the job done well and that's why one would probably want to buy it.

Another thing it seemed to do was to print out duplicates and triplicates of not only the return but also bunches of worksheets that I'll probably never look at again or need. I had tons of paper when I finished. And I'm pretty sure that I didn't request all the extra copies.

Next year maybe I'll try Tax Cut or one of the other tax applications.",software

1518,18,3891,"Most people buying VMware Fusion 2 do so because they need (or want) to run Windows programs on their Mac, although you can use it to install any alternate operating system.  This virtual machine is incredibly easy to install and use.  It provides a set-up Wizard that takes the user step-by-step through its use, with tutorials, and through the installation of Windows or other operating system such as Linux.

The VM creates a separate machine environment in a single window; it looks like a desk top within a desk top, with Mac OS ""liquid"" buttons at the top and an exact replica (for lack of a better word) of the operating system start up screen.  Don't be fooled, however; this is not a Mac OS masquerading as Windows.  It is a complete version of the secondary operating system, with all its rules and procedures.  You can quit VM, but it will only suspend Windows.  To shut down the virtual machine, you have to click on the ""turn off computer"" button on the Windows desk top (it will not shut down your Mac, only Windows, which ""thinks"" it is its own computer).  To use Windows-environment programs, you must install them as though the VM screen is your actual computer.  At any time, you can return to the Mac environment by clicking outside the ""desk top"" screen.

This software is best for high-powered Macs.  Running two operating systems can tax your computer if it doesn't have the memory and speed to handle it.  My Mac Mini, with 2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo and 2 GB RAM, has no problem, although it doesn't have the necessary 3D graphics support, so that sometimes causes problems when running games.  And I've had a couple of Mac program crashes when Windows is trying to update itself.  Most times, however, this software runs smoothly and without issues.  The problems are minor compared to the advantages it offers, and most are due to Windows, not to VMware Fusion.

Especially for people who are making the switch between a PC and a Mac, this software offers the comfort of a familiar environment, with the ability to use the few programs made for Windows only.  The Mac OS is far superior to Windows, however, so don't make the mistake of continuing to buy Windows software just because you own VMware Fusion.  This program is made for those times when Windows is the only recourse.

Note:  Unless you have an installation CD for Windows, you'll have to buy that separately.

1523,23,7357,"Installation on my desktop running Windows 7 went very smoothly (took about 15 minutes from start to finish) and I found the software to be surprisingly snappy when processing videos.

But I need to back up a moment and mention that although I spend a great deal of time working on graphics, I'm new to video editing (aside from some tutorial and review videos I did using TechSmith's Camtasia) and this software has a serious learning curve. I would actually recommend the first thing a new user do is download the documentation (which is surprisingly thorough and actually helpful) from the Corel website and read it. But be warned, it's massive.

Moving along, I've mainly been using this software to create relatively short movies (longest being about 15 minutes) geared toward teaching/reviewing and have found them to compile/render quickly (less than 30 minutes apiece). And the software sports and amazing number of features, but I'm absolutely in love with its subtitle feature. It's a little scary how easy they are to add and the software detects where the sound clips are so you don't need to manually queue up the subtitles to speech--that was an absolute joy for me. Overall I enjoy using this software and find myself opening it far more than Casmtasia when I need to edit a video.

Now I would be remiss if I didn't mention that privacy junkies should be certain to completely read the licensing agreement because it grants Corel the right to collect certain data (along with potentially personally identifiable information) through use of the software. And it also states that the software can only be installed on a single machine and in the event you need to install it on another machine should your hard disk fail (it seems that's the only scenario in which you'd be allowed to reinstall the software on another computer) you must *call* Corel's customer service for permission to do so...this could cramp the style of a multi-computer household, and at least Apple gives you the ability to deregister a computer via its website.",software

Cons: After using this a couple times I found that it increased my computer's ""boot up"" time to over 2 minutes longer than it was.  Most spy-ware or scanning devices have the same problem, so I don't see anything here that makes it stand out from any other software. I have to turn ""Intelligard"" off completely to do any web surfing.  I didn't pay for DSL so I could have my browser slowed to a crawl by the PC tools program.

There is also no easy way to uninstall it!  It won't show up on my list of programs on the control panel, nor are there any instructions in the help files on how to get rid of it.  So, in a way, this PC Tools program has become like the things it is supposed to be protecting my computer from!  It takes up memory and I can't get rid of it.

Pros: It's easy to use, and gives you options as to what you might want to delete versus not.  It describes the risk level and type of risk, even offers to save a ""go back"" point/version in case you decide you deleted something you shouldn't have, and need to ""go back.""  Keeps a history file so you can see later what was removed.

I liked the option of having it automatically download and install updates without my having to affirm window after window in order to do so.  I also like that I can use it on up to three computers at home.

It didn't hog up a ton of memory on my hard drive.  It found several things that Norton and McAfee missed.  I had tried ""ad-aware"" but that program only caused more problems than it helped- (buggy, slow, incomplete coverage, etc.)

1530,30,8204,"I have been using Norton products for years and have seen a continual improvement over time.  Norton 360 Multi-Device is everything I want in an Internet security program.

I got this because the subscription on my existing Norton 360 Multi-Device was ending in a few months. Once you purchase this you get a one year subscription. After the year is up you can either buy another year of service from Norton or buy the product from a third party like Amazon. In my case I was given the opportunity to review this for free through the Amazon Vine program so jumped at the chance to do so.

One of the nice features with Norton is that once installed it will always update to the latest version of the software you purchased. As a result of this there is no pressure to try the new and improved version because you are getting the newest version of the software you purchased.

When you press the Norton icon you get a screen that has security, identity, backup and tuneup options.  Each option gives you a number of choices such as when to run scans or updates or how to manage identity protection. It is easy to use and ideal for people who are not computer experts.

Norton Safe Search will also appear when I search the Internet.  There is a search box and if you go through it Norton will let you know if a site is safe or not before you go to it.

One of the things I like about Norton is there is 24 hour live free technical support available for issues with installation or product use in general. I had an issue this year that may have been virus related and I called technical support. The agent addressed my concern and thankfully it was not a virus issue.

Over the past year I have had a couple of warnings that a virus had been blocked.  I have yet to have a virus problem in the years I have been using Norton products.

When you buy a Norton product you get 365 days of updates to keep your computer protected from the latest spyware and virus threats.  I had four months of my subscription left and a Norton agent was able to add that to the year that came with this product.

When I first started using Norton many years ago I would use additional programs for added protection against spyware. I just use Norton now. I am confident that it will protect my computer from virus or spyware issues. Additionally when scans are running I can still work on my computer without everything slowing down.

Norton continues to impress me.",software

After two months the XP operating system ran without any problems either on Visa or XP.  But then the new computer running on Vista crashed.  I lost all my files and had to access the recovery portion of the hard drive to get the computer to boot.  Then I had to download all the security downloads.

1546,46,909,"This game is super popular among ND fans. More than once Ive heard people say that its one of the best (if not the best) titles in the series. But it also has a reputation for being fairly scary and having very complicated puzzles. I guess it was that reputation that turned me off to this game, but I finally ended up buying it because I felt like I couldn't call myself a true Nancy Drew fan without having played Curse of Blackmoor Manor. I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.

PLOT  5/5:  This was one of the most interesting plots Ive come across in a ND game. Nancy has been asked by her neighbor, Mrs. Petrov, to fly to England and help her daughter. Her daughter Linda recently married a British diplomat named Hugh Penvellyn, but since her wedding Lindas attitude has drastically changed. She has become short tempered and paranoid and constantly getting sick, and by the time Nancy gets to Blackmoor Manor Linda has hidden herself away in her bedroom and refuses to show her face to anyone.  Blackmoor Manor has a storied reputation of secrets and witchcraft and for generations locals have believed it to be haunted by a werewolf-like monster called the Beast of Blackmoor. Its up to Nancy to get to the bottom of all of this to help Linda.

Like I said, I thought this plot was fascinating. There was so much detail put into the history of Blackmoor and the Penvellyn family history and I had so much fun unravelling it all as the plot went on. It was a great length and held my interest the whole time. I really have no complaints about the plot.

CHARACTERS  4.5/5: There was a really great cast of characters in this game. There was Linda, who I thought was very interesting and I wished I could have interacted more with her. The other residents of the house were Jane, Lindas 12 year old step daughter (also one of my new favorite characters), Hugh Penvellyns aunt Mrs. Drake, and Nigel, a historian who is currently researching Blackmoor Manor for a book he is writing on the Penvellyn family. There was also Janes tutor Ethel, but Ethel was different because you could only talk to her a couple of times over the course of the game. There was also Loulou, the annoying hint parrot. I really enjoyed the voice acting work and impressed overall with the characters.

SETTING  4.5/5: Blackmoor Manor was definitely an interesting place. It reminded me a lot of Wickford Castle from Treasure in the Royal Tower  especially the main hall. Blackmoor Manor was excessively decorated so there was plenty to look at even if some parts of it were pretty gaudy. It was huge and there was a ton to explore, not to mention lots of areas unlocked over the course of the story. I also really enjoyed the music in this game.

PUZZLES - 4/5: This was a puzzle heavy game. The puzzles ranged from ones that were quick and self-explanatory to ones that were incredibly complicated and took many different steps to complete. I used a walkthrough for most of it. I did appreciate how well thought out the puzzles were, however some of them were so long and complicated that it felt daunting having to complete them. There weren't really any chores in this game, which was good. The only thing that could come close to counting as a chore was that Jane required you to play a game with her before she would do anything for you. This was a little annoying but luckily her games were easy.

IS IT CHALLENGING? Absolutely. There was no way I could have figured out some of those puzzles without a walkthrough. 4.5/5

ENDING - 4/5: The ending was good, but not as strong as the other aspects of the game. The reveal at the end and the appearance of the culprit was kind of abrupt and a little underwhelming. The culprits motives made sense but I didn't really like who they chose as the culprit. But catching them was exciting and I liked how everything was wrapped up in the epilogue.

FINAL SCORE:
Plot: 5
Characters: 4.5
Setting: 4.5
Puzzles: 4
Challenge: 4.5
Ending: 4

The learning curve scared me at first, but the tutorials made it pretty simple to get started. I have not mastered the skills as yet, but was able to create some simple videos pretty fast. I have stuck with relatively simple inanimate objects like ships and such so far. I'm about ready to start with the bone rigging and lip-syncing. It has been pretty fun so far.

1554,54,462,"I may be going out on a limb here, but Windows XP is the most important upgrade to the Windows operating system since Windows 95. In addition to a new look, it offers stability, ease of use and more Internet integration than ever before.
Installation was easy. You can either upgrade your existing Windows or do a clean install. I recommend a clean install so be sure to back up your important data (e-mail, accounting programs, etc.) You can boot from the CD and it will pretty much to the rest. Installation takes about 30-60 minutes but it was VERY easy. XP really knows what plug and play means. ALL, and I mean ALL of my peripherals were found and configured automatically.
Once installed, you will be prompted to activate. This was an easy and fast process. The next thing it will do is set up your Internet access. Once this is done, you are now ready to go. You will notice right away that the interface is different and very colorful. It may take a little while to get used to but once you do, you will like it. You also have an option of a ""classic"" Windows 9x view.
Windows XP makes a lot of functions very easy. First of all, depending on your BIOS and motherboard, you can tell Windows just what to do when you press your power button. It also has built in CD burning capability, however, to delete a file from a CD-RW, you must erase the CD and then put back the files you want. A little inconvenient but a lot more stable than DirectCD. It is VERY easy to set up individual users. You can set up a personalized account for each member of the family. Also, when installing many programs, it will detect XP and ask if you want certain people to access the program. This is very nice and secure. And with Internet Explorer 6.0, you can now choose the level of cookie protection. You will be amazed on how many third party ""usage tracking"" cookies that are placed on your PC.
Backward compatibly is very good to excellent with XP. XP ran all of my older windows based programs and MOST of my DOS games. A newer Windows game didn't work correctly but all it took was to make it run in Windows98/ME compatibility mode and it fixed it. A few DOS games worked about 80% and some not at all. I am sure that ""DOS EMULATORS"" will be available for purchase in the near future.
Windows XP seemed designed for Internet integration. Just about every major function in XP has a tie to the Internet. And because of this, Microsoft has included a built in Firewall. It is good, but I would recommend Norton Internet Security 2002.
For those of you who are worried about compatibility, Windows XP makes it pretty easy to set up a dual boot. All you need is a partition created before installing. After that, Windows does the rest.
For those who want security, go with Windows XP Professional. Everyone else can get by with Windows XP Home. If you have a previous copy of Windows, get the UPGRADE version. It will search for a previous install or ask you for the original Windows 9.x/2000 disk to verify.
There is a lot more I can say about Windows XP but you just need to see it for yourself. If you want stability, awesome Internet integration and overall easy of use, you must get this upgrade.",software

That is a terrible decision. You can navigate there but you cannot have it easily accessed but the ever present OneDrive is always in your face. I also dislike the less colorful icons. And there are many things where you cannot change the default in any easy way. For example, there are complex registry editing work arounds to the aforementioned DropBox issue. You can also take a series of steps to create a half work-around for changing the default PowerPoint slide shape back to 4:3. But it's a pain. I do not know anyone using 16:9 slide shapes regularly. I got one recently from a colleague and I thought they had screwed up (because it made the fonts so small and hard to read). Of course, that all can be changed--but not with a simple default setting change. You have to make such changes for every single presentation you build. There are so many poor design changes where something that worked fine before has been changed in some more limiting or hard-to-find manner. I would try to stay with the 2010 and earlier versions of Office as long as you possibly can--unless you want to be very unproductive and Google a lot of stuff (that you'll find out you cannot easily fix) for awhile.

If you manage to get past the hassle of getting this properly registered and working, you're then forced to put up with the numerous upgrades of other programs which, if you're lucky, will function error-free.

The game's storyline involves a woman searching for her daughter who has been captured by an evil fairy.  The characters find themselves trapped in dreams, involved with fairies- imagination runs high in this game, and those who enjoy fairy and dream-related themes will likely enjoy this.  To play the game you look through each scene for items you can pick up that allow you to further progress through the scene.  For example, if you encounter a door with a lock, you might have to find the pieces to assemble the lock.  The items to solve the puzzles can be hidden anywhere- one might be down a well, for example, so to get to it you might have to find the rope, crank, and bucket.  Crank rusty?  Then you might need to find some oil.  Your cursor indicates when you're on top of something that needs attention, and you can use the clues from these to help you know exactly what you need to find.

Currently, I am using ScanSoft's paperport software for following manipulations:
(1) To combing multiple documents into a single PDF file. Or remove/extract pages from a multi-page PDF file.
(2) Rotate page(s) of PDF files.

My intention of using Corel Fusion is to convert PDF files into editable documents.

The Goods:
(a) Easy to install and does an excellent job of converting documents to PDF files. The software allows me to open multiple PDFs, drag and drop certain pages among them, and then recombine them. The drag-and-drop assembly feature is excellent and easy to use.
(b) I don't have to go through the trouble of opening up a file. I can simply drag the file or document into the program.
(c) I can convert a batch of files into PDF instead of doing it one by one.

The Annoying:
(a) It does NOT come with any owners manual, not even on the installation disk!
(b) The speed of file saving is slow. Also, the editing speed is slow. My PC has Intel iCore-7 with 12G memory.
(c) Corel Fusion can only convert PDF documents into Word or SpreadSheet.
(d) Don't try to fill in a PDF blank form with Fusion, as this is not a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get program. Forms that appear fine on the screen will not print out correctly.
(e) Corel Fusion uses heavy compression with no user control on the image quality. Be careful if you intend to include graphics or pictures in your PDF files.

The Bads:
(a) It does convert PDF file into Word document. But tables doesn't work and bullets has problems. All the text is there, but the formatting is gone.
(b) It does not allow you to click on a text filed to edit it. To cut and paste text objects, you'd better do it in Word, not in Corel Fusion.
(c) Corel Fusion provides comment boxes with large border for me to add comments, paragraph, or a signature. However, it's extremely difficult to neatly position the comment boxes in the document.

All in all, at this bargain price, Corel PDF Fusion is a good choice for people want to combine pages into a PDF file, extract pages from PDF files, or rotate pages in a PDF file.

1587,87,3125,"I've been a Norton user ever since the olden days of Apple: The Mac Performa was the first color computer I ever toyed with.  I had Norton 6 (I believe) and loved it.  It was small, simple, effective.  I used the full Norton software on later PCs and found them to be bloated and memory hogging.  Not worth the money I paid for them at all.

I do appreciate the more silent footprint of this new Norton, however, all they did was lessen the GUI's presence.  The bloat is still there, you just don't see it.  Take a simple virus scan for example: I have a dualcore Centrino laptop and just a virus scan brought the poor thing to its knees.  Unacceptable.  Also, the cleanup works TOO well, essentially making Firefox ""forget"" everything even when you tell it not to.

The straw: the heuristic virus protection.  It blocks websites that are in no way dangers to your computer, and deletes software programs that are just updates or patches (not warez).  It assumes something must be dangerous just because it opens a port to function - guess what?  A lot of software might need to do that, including some of Microsoft's own.  It's no big deal.

1590,90,988,"This was my first experience with mobile GPS. I decided after riding in my mom's Toyota Sienna that her GPS system was excellent. Keep in mind, she had a high dollar system so I expected it to be much better then anything I would buy that is portable.

I bought Streets and Trips 2006 at my local best buy store for $89, it came with the GPS locator. I had my laptop in the car with me so I installed the software and it started to work immediatly, I was impressed that it pinpointed my location as quickly as it did. I typed in my home address and bingo, it routed me onto the interstate and home. That part worked perfectly. I will say that on the way home on I-40 they shifted the road for road construction, the system was so accurate there that it kept saying ""OFF ROUTE"" because the lanes were temp. shifted about 30 feet onto the shoulder, that was pretty cool. Overall with this I was impressed.

What I was not impressed with was: I live on a major road, about 1.5 miles behind my place is a wal-mart with several roads that go to it. When I used the GPS system to navigate me to the store it tried to route me on a 10 mile trip, apparently some of the roads I normally take were not in the map database. In fact there was a total of 3 missing roads in this one 1.5 mile area that had been in Knoxville since I moved here 4 years ago. These are not brand new roads, they are at minimum 4 years old and SHOULD be in the map database.

Other issues I have with the software include the Pocket PC piece. While the pocket PC does display the maps perfectly it will not create routes for you. Additionally if you try to hook the GPS locator up to your pocket pc you will find that it does not ROUTE or NAVIGATE you. The GPS locator simply shows you on the map where you are, in my case it was about 1/4 mile off, this was a  huge problem for me. The reason I bought it was so I could put my pocket pc in my truck and use that as my navigation system. Not so, it doesn't speak, it doesn't route, it doesn't navigate. It's just a picture with a moving dot that represesnts your current position.

Speaking of, speaking. The program does offer verbal turn by turn guidance, however do NOT expect this program to announce the names of the streets you are to turn on. It simply says ""TURN LEFT"", I would have liked it to say ""TURN LEFT ON MAIN STREET"" for example.

North, south, east or west??? One more thing I don't like about this program is lack of detail in directions. I punched in to go from work to home and it routed me via interstates. When I left work and neared the on-ramp it said ""TURN RIGHT in .3 miles"", the screen showed ""TURN RIGHT ON I-40"", it didn't tell me east or west. Then on my way home I take the I-75 split, it said ""STAY RIGHT"" but it didn't display if I needed I-75 North or south. Had construction been going on and lanes shifted, etc I would not have known what road to take because it didn't say the direction to go in. Simply not enough information.

Another gripe, re-route is not an automated feature. I wish Microsoft would have put an option on the program to ""AUTO RE-ROUTE"" if you are off of the designated route when using your laptop and the locator. Instead it says ""OFF ROUTE"" and you either have to drive back on route or press the F3 button or click the ""RE-ROUTE"" button. Seems silly it can't do this automatically.

And one last gripe, there is an offramp here in knoxville where you can not make a right turn, it is posted and illegal. This software when I am on my way to work constantly tells me to make that right turn. That is one big issue.

Overall, the product works as expected for a $90 GPS solution. It would have received 5 stars if the Pocket PC piece actually was useful and if a few of the roads around me that had been around were in the database. It works decent, but not good enough. This is a good ""test"" program to use to see if GPS is for you. I have since stopped using the GPS locator part and simply use streets and trips at home to plan my trips, figure out mileage, etc. I now use a Magellan Roadmate 760 which I purchased here at Amazon as my in car navigation system.

I would have expected Microsoft, the large company they are to have a more up to date, hi-tech program. This thing doesn't speak street names, doesn't tell which dirction to go when approaching freeways and interstates. It will get you where you are going, but the lack of updated roads make take you well out of your way to get there.",software

Out of the four games I've played (""Final Scene,"" ""Secrets Can Kill,"" ""Message in a Haunted Mansion, ""Treasure in the Royal Tower""), ""Treasure in the Royal Tower"" had the most satisfying plot, interesting characters, clever dialogue, and the most cool places to explore.
Nancy is on vacation at a ski resort in Wisconsin built by an eccentric millionaire. The resort is built to look like a castle, complete with a tower that was imported from a chateau in France. French queen Marie Antoinette used to spend a good deal of time in the tower, and one of the hotel guests believes that the tower holds an important secret that could clear Marie Antoinette's name. When you arrive, a killer blizzard leaves everyone trapped in the castle, and the castle's library has been vandalized. Besides yourself, there are a number of suspects: Jacques, the Olympic ski instructor, Lisa, the photojournalist, Dexter, the caretaker, and Mrs. Hotchkiss, the eccentric Marie Antoinette scholar. As the game progresses you will learn a great deal about French Revolutionary history and Marie Antoinette in particular.
The locations in the game are varied and realistic: an imposing lobby, a comfy lounge with a blazing fireplace, the ransacked library, Nancy's room, castle corridors that lead to dead ends, twisty stone stairwells, an antique elevator, a shed, a secret garden and the Royal Tower. Along the way you'll slip along secret passageways, climb elevator shafts, and ascend into the Royal Tower to find Marie Antoinette's secret, but...BE CAREFUL. Someone doesn't want you to succeed in your search: you are deliberately trapped in the elevator, hit over the head, and locked outside to freeze to death. Only your quick thinking and detective skills can save Nancy!
Buyer Beware:
I *loved * this game, but I have to give it only three stars because I had HORRIBLE problems getting the game to run. It would crash constantly in the middle of conversations or leave me stuck at a certain point in a hallway before giving me an error message of ""Invalid CHUNK file."" I had to restart the game 25-30 times before I could beat it, and it would cause my computer to crash as well. There is no patch available on HerInteractive's website. I changed a number of settings and configurations and the problem didn't go away. The most frustrating thing was that it wouldn't let me beat the game: after the villain revealed their identity, a chase scene was supposed to follow, but the computer would never return control to me and the baddie got away every time. When I selected the ""Second Chance"" feature, the game would inevitably lock up and my computer would crash again. Very, very frustrating.",software
1595,95,6927,"I love the new interface, and thought I'd miss the start button,so I downloaded the start shell execution file.  After playing with 8 for a couple of hours, I never put the start button back. I have upgraded my 3 computers, my daughter's, and several of my friends.  They all love the program.

Update: 3/1/13 I love this program and I will never go back to Windows 7. The interface is so easy to use, and I have probably upgraded over 100 computers now with it, and so far have not had one complaint. It plays all my games and all of my other software has had zero problems.

Update: September 25, 2013

I seriously think this is Microsoft's best operating system ever. I still has some minor flaws, but it is very fast, and finds the right drivers. I recently added a parallel port by PCI Express. I restarted, entered the bios, saved changes, and booted into Windows 8. Then I went into the device manager, parallel port, properties, and changed the port settings from LPT-3 to LPT-1 where it is supposed to be. I turned on my old HP Laserjet 5, and plugged in the cable while Windows 8 was running. Down on the taskbar, Windows was loading the right drivers for that 20 + year old printer. Take the time to learn 8, and it will out perform 7, 3 to 1. It even downloads my I Phone, and 7 would not.",software

1602,102,5176,"The 2011 AVG Internet Security suite appears to have all the same bells and whistles as the 2010 edition with a few added features that are both hit and miss depending on the operating system and size of the hard drive. 2011 is still using AVG 9 Help dialogue which is interesting to me. I feel like this simple aspect should be updated as often as the program as is updated. Still, that is just a minor little notation. The registry cleaner/performance booster actually seems to be one of the most problematic program features for me personally. It has caused more trouble then anything else and I wound up having to do a complete system restore to get my computer back up after some serious freezing issues and performance jitters after running it.

However, this program DOES have a lot of perks to it. The viral scanning, while somewhat time consuming, is extremely efficient and actually warned and took care of a few trojans/worms that were in my system that THREE other antivirus software scans did not detect. This boosts my faith in AVG as a product and makes me wish that my system were more up to date to run AVG 2011 to it's full capacity. AVG is definitely the most dependable of any anti-virus and spyware detecting softwares on the market today.

I do have to say that this really, really drains the life from my system. This, however, is probably more to do with the fact that my computer is almost obsolete at 3 years old and running Vista on a 32 bit system. Running this program on a newer system running windows 7 should be speedy and effortless. For those of us with systems that are a little bit dated it can be a bit of a struggle juggling performance and scanning at the same time. That was an issue for me.

But, AVG is amazing. The scanning is thorough and if you want a lot of extra features this product is AMAZING. If you just want a basic antivirus scan you might want to try something a little less complex...but, for the price, this is an amazing deal.",software

1605,105,8296,"I just bought another copy of the ""older"" N360 2013 for the new registation Key, but I've been running this newer ""2014"" version for a few months already. Norton has the nice feature of alway being able to upgrade to the latest version as long as your subcription is still current. I have a little over 2 months left on my current N360 subscription and saw the 2013 version available a  nice price here on Amazon, so I bought another 3PC one user box. I have to wait untill my current subscription expires or a day or so untill it does to enter the new KEY, because if I did it now, I would lose the remainder of my current subscription.

OK, I've said enough that is not really review material, but should be useful to anybody using Norton.
Review-wise, I think Norton 360 is a great product and works well for me. The only issue I have with it is the stupid cloud based  (these days) password ""vault"". I preferred the older, local  password manager, which on one of my PC's, is the way I still have it set up. I made the mistake of logging onto Symantec one day with my user ID and password, and it kind of ""Grabbed"" my password manager and made it the cloud based vault thing, which sounded OK, but when I logged into it with my Laptop, which had fewer log-ins and passwords, it for some crazy reason synched the cloud data FROM my laptop. When I used my desktop next time, the Cloud password data got synched TO my desktop and I lost 3/4 of my log ins and passwords. Fortunately, I back up my passwords to a local hardrive file with a built in, but awkward to find utility in Norton to import or export, and I was able to get it all back.
Other than that quirk. I like the software a while lot. It runs smotthly, and does not cause my PC's to crash. That IS pretty bad, but I was able to recover.",software
1606,106,541,"The seventh in the series, these games are relatively inexpensive yet provide hours of gameplay. In them, Nancy Drew, the college-aged female detective, explores mysteries and finds solutions to various puzzles.
You can see the various improvements in this latest entry. The graphics are much smoother, and as you turn around in a given area the 'snapshot' quality is more of a flow. It's still not a fully immersive environment - in essence you go ""to"" a spot and then can turn left or right through set images of the room. You can point to a ""hot spot"" in the room to approach an item or examine it. Still, in a way this makes it easier for younger detectives to know what to do. If you can't click on something, it's not important.
There's no violence or blood, although I do have to comment that the ghost dogs are rather scary! I have had younger teenage girls refuse to play some of the games I've lent them because they were too scary after a few hours. This one might fall into that category if you have a skittish nature. The dogs don't actually attack you, but their jumping on the doors, howling and rattling the house can be quite frightning.
The game uses very logical puzzles that actually teach you things. You want to test water from a well, but first you have to learn the real technique for priming a pump and do it. You need to use a motorboat, but the pistons aren't in the proper cycle positions. Anyone who uses a boat would see this by looking at the engine, and they helpfully include a diagram to show you (i.e. Nancy) how to fix this before the engine will work. Notes at the ranger station warn you about Hantavirus, a real danger if you're cleaning areas where mice live.
There are other puzzles - identifying birds, finding planks to get over rotten floorboards and so on - that fit in as well. In general the game does an admirable job of keeping the game very realistic-feeling, like you're really at this Pennsylvanian lake, amongst the locals there, exploring their world.
On the downside, much of the game involves pony-trail sorts of handoffs. You know you need a spark plug. You might think it would be lying around nearby or that one would be in the house. But instead, searching all over creation finds none. Instead, you have to go to sleep, wake up at night, chat with someone who it so happens has one, go back to sleep again, and then in the morning use it. It can get extremely frustrating when at many times in the game you know what you *need* but just have to figure out how the game designers think you should *get* it.
Still, many times this means that your gameplay time is stretched out as you wander around, explore, chat with people, and enjoy the world. It's not a game for people who want to race through to the end to have 'beaten it'. If you poke at a walkthrough site, you can probably do so in an hour or two. Instead, it's a game that, for a relatively low price, lets you wander through a well realized world, exercise those ""little grey cells"" in your brain, and really become knowledgeable about a number of intersting subjects.

1607,107,6166,"This review is for TuboTax 2011 Deluxe for Federal Returns. Fortunately I live in Texas and there is no state income tax so I don't have to worry about the state portion.

TurboTax has had its share of issues but I came back to it because it does seem to be the best there is, but I'm knocking off a star because of the history of issues I've had with the program in previous years (like it not calculating tax correctly until I deleted some assets and then re-entered them). However, I was a little shocked to read that it requires 515MB of HD space PLUS up to 1.5GB more if Microsoft .NET 4 is not installed (Mac is only 330MB). Wow! That could be over 2GB of HD to do taxes (last year it was over 1GB). How inefficient we have become!

Fortunately the system requirements says it works on 64-bit systems, and now it specifically mentions Windows 7 64-bit as well as Vista. When I installed it on my Win 7 64-bit machine, installation (mid Jan 2012) seemed to go well without any problems. When it checked for updates, it found 4 updates at 13.2MB and they all seemed to install properly... so no major install issues for me (unlike 2 years ago), however I did have a minor issue. I accidentally canceled the initial updates because the program responded slowly when I clicked the Update button and so I clicked it again. The problem was by the time my 2nd click ""registered"", Turbotax had changed the button to a 'Cancel' button. No big deal though but a little annoying.

NOTE: Deluxe will do a Schedule C just fine, but it may not provide as much help as the Home & Business version. If you have been doing taxes yourself for awhile then you might not need to pay the extra money for the additional help.

I will update this review as I continue to use the product.

Pros:
* Price includes federal E-File
* Overall, probably the best tax program there is
* Does not say it works on Windows XP 64-bit (but does with 32-bit XP with SP 3+)
* Works on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Vista and Windows 7
* Deluxe version can do a Schedule C for the self-employed - but it doesn't provide as much guidance as the Home & Business edition
* Claims ""100% guaranteed accurate calculations""

Cons:
* Not perfect (but how can US taxes ever be perfect)?
* Have encountered bugs in previous years that caused me to have to delete and re-enter assets
* Might take over 2GB of HD space on Windows according to the system requirements

Other:
* Their marketing continues to be ""guide you step-by-step like a GPS"" to get your max refund... hope it doesn't make mistakes like my GPS does sometimes! But they seem to have toned it down this year (good if you ask me).",software

Installation was quick and easy, though I think after installation the software required about 4 major updates which made it all take a while longer.

I'm using Office 2007 on Windows XP, as well, and I've also used it on a Vista machine.

I like the way the new Mac version has kept nice, compact default views on all the major app pages. You can bring up all the nice tools and gadgets quickly and easily by just clicking on buttons for Gallery, Toolbox, Navigation, and so on. Those various toolbars fade in very quickly up top, giving you very easy access to templates and such without stealing too much additional screen real estate.

A lot of people gripe about Windows functionality. I don't really need high-powered usage on any of the apps. I'm setting up Word documents without too much formatting, PowerPoint decks using only minor tweaks of existing templates, and, well, come to think of it, I really don't ever deal with any huge spreadsheets in Excel. For average, everyday use, I think it's pretty adequate.

Also, I never loved Apple Mail. I just don't think it has enough time-management features. I'm glad to have more ability to set up appointments, link to actions and contacts, and track to-do's through Entourage.

Also, Windows XP keeps your system files from being corrupted by viruses by not allowing unauthorized access to the files.

1622,122,8084,"Mavis Beacon is back with a new edition, and she is still as relevant as ever.  I got this for my first and third graders to learn how to type.  The third grader has had a few basic lessons at school, and this program is working well with what he's doing there.  He already knew the ""home keys"", and so the lessons on learning the letters that go with the fingers were perfect for him.  He was already doing some of that, so MB is great reinforcement and extra practice for him.  He is improving steadily, and is starting to use proper form when using the computer.

The first grader on the other hand, has never had any typing lessons before.  The concept of the home keys is new to him, and it isn't really emphasized very much by MB.  He rushed through to get to the actual typing lessons, but was just using whichever fingers were easy for him to do *fast*, so I stopped him.  We'll try it again in another year or so - I think he's just too young for this particular program.  So, the ""ages 8 to adult"" on the package is probably right on target!

All in all, Mavis is as good as ever, and teaching a skill that is critical to life in the world today.  Some other comments, off the top of my head:
- This program has audio - just about everything is read aloud.  Unfortunately, on my computer (not the fastest), the audio lagged a little bit, and isn't as helpful as it could be.
- The videos that show you what each lesson is about - seem to be there just so they can say they have videos, because they really are just showing the lesson.  Watch the video, do the lesson, same difference!

1627,127,1763,"Chances are in your house you have several computers, maybe a laptop or two and a desktop in the den or the your kids room.  All these machines serve different functions -- one is for your business, one might be for storing digital pictures and the kids may use theirs for playing games.  They are all different and even though they reside under the same roof it is next to impossible to share files with them all and when it comes to backup -- well, just ask yourself this, when is the last time you backed any of them up?  You are a digital home but a connected home you are not.

Enter Microsoft's newest product, Windows Home Server.  A revolutionary product that offers consumers centralized storage and backups in their households with a product that you plug in and literally let it run without any intervention on your part.

Windows Home Server makes the concept of a connected home a reality in a simple, easy to use package that will bring your entire digital family together in one place.  Imagine never having to worry about backups again because they are taken automatically, every night, while you sleep.  Think of how easy it would be to share digital pictures, movies and files with your family without having to e-mail them or put them on USB fobs that always seem to get lost.  What if you could check to make sure your kids have their anti-virus protection running without having to check their computer manually?  How about never having to worry about your precious family photos, home videos and important documents getting lost because of a computer crash thanks to data redundancy?

If these sound like your idea of a dream, then dream no more.  All these features and more await you in Windows Home Server.

The idea is simple.  Put a machine (doesn't have to be too powerful) in an out of the way location in the house.  It doesn't need a keyboard or a mouse, just hard drives.  But wait, even the hard drives don't have to be all the same or fit inside the box.  You can hook up any combination of hard disks you want -- from internal to external USB and firewire drives.  Windows Home Server manages them for you, creating one big pool of disk space that is duplicated across the drives -- so if one fails, you don't lose one byte of data!

Backups are a breeze as well; every night Windows Home Server backups up files from all the connected PC's and stores them on the server.  However, it doesn't just back up files -- it intelligently decides which files are different, and which aren't and doesn't backup duplicates.  So if everyone in your house has Microsoft Word installed, it won't create 5 backup copies of it.  Just one copy which all 5 computers can restore from!

Traveling and need access to your Powerpoint presentation or important document?  Fire up a web browser and securely access any file stored on the server!  Better yet, remote connect to any computer in your household running Windows Vista or XP and use it as if you were sitting right in front of it.  All from a secure web browser!

One more thing for all you XBOX 360 owners out there, or those of you who have digital picture frames that are network-aware -- Windows Home Server has the ability to stream content to your XBOX 360 and to your digital picture frames!  Functionality ""out of the box"", which will no doubt be extended further as third party applications start to appear thanks to the Windows Home Server Software Development Kit (SDK) that Microsoft has released for WHS.

1628,128,7915,"I have been running 2013 Plus for almost a year on 2 Windows 8 Pro 64bit computers. It has worked flawlessly. With several scheduled backups on each at different times and backup locations.
 I recieved an offer directly from Acronis to upgrade to 2014. I emailed them as to what improvments were made and they said Interface and cloud/Network backup. I thought I would give it a try.
 Glad I did. It is much faster than 2013. The GUI is a little cleaner.
 I have now got 3 Win 8 computers running Acronis Premium. 2014. They all have multiple backups to different locations. No problems at all.
 I recommend intergrating Acronis into the Windows boot. It gives an ""F11"" Boot option at bootup, so you can go into Acronis instead of booting. Restores and backups both work from a ""Linux"" enviroment. It works great. You can also make bootable media from Acronis to do the same thing on DVD or CD.
 Warning....This is a powerful product. Please read the Manual.
 The ""Clone feature"" is in my opinion, the best on the market. I have done several and they worked everytime.
 Also recommended is to set frequent ""Validation"" of all backups. Just  to make sure they will work.

Back in the early days, you needed to buy a third party program to burn CDs, and Toast was the most powerful and reliable one. For years now, OSX has been shipping with built-in burner support, but if you want full control over your CD or DVD burning, Toast is still the way to go.
It also offers extra features such as video conversion and menu creation, which lets you create a standard movie DVD complete with custom menus from a set of video files. Unfortunately, these advanced features can be hit or miss; I was never too successful using them, as conversion can take hours and hours, and the result is not always very good.
Toast also comes bundled with a few useful programs: Disc Cover 3 RE lets you print CD and DVD labels, DiscCatalogMaker is an indexing program allowing you to keep track of your files across your DVD backups, Get Backup 2 RE (a backup app), Spin Doctor (an audio recording app), Tivo Transfer (copy files from your TiVo) and Mac2Tivo (stream videos from your Mac to your TiVo).

1632,132,4483,"PaperPort is a very helpful tool for reducing or eliminating physical clutter by helping you scan your paper documents into PDF files. Once the paperwork is scanned, PaperPort allows you to easily collate, stack, and rearrange your pages just as you would with paper documents. PaperPort does have one major advantage over keeping your paperwork in a physical filing cabinet -- its OCR technology can recognize the text in your scanned documents so that you can conduct a search for a specific document simply by using a word (or several words) in the document you're searching for.

Pros
----
- Virtual Desktop
The Graphical User Interface is a lot like Windows. The left pane displays your Folders in a Tree Structure and the right pane displays the files in the active folder. Like Windows Explorer, you can choose to view your files as Large Icons, Small Icons, List, Details, or Thumbnails. I find the Thumbnails view (default) most useful because it not only shows the image of your file, it allows you to ""flip"" the pages on the thumbnail by clicking its forward and backward arrow. Nice! This makes working in PaperPort feel like working in a virtual desktop environment.

- OCR Reasonably Good
The OCR is about 85% - 90% accurate most of the time. This could be a ""con"" for some people because they may expect a higher accuracy. Personally, I think the accuracy is reasonably good. The OCR will work even when the scan resolution is at 150 dpi (the lower resolution allows much quicker scanning than the standard/recommended 300 dpi), although the accuracy may diminish slightly as a result.

- Scanning Niceties
I love the Auto Straighten feature. With Auto Straighten, you just place the document to be scanned on your flatbed without worrying about whether it's on straight because the app straightens the final scan for you. You also have the option of erasing any of the edges. You get to specify how much of the edge(s) to remove (in inches or mm). This is a handy feature for removing, say, 3-hole punch marks from the edge of the paper.

- Manipulate PDF Files
You can annotate PDF by typing notes (using either the note tool or textbox tool), highlighting, underlining, or drawing/scribbling (using the pencil tool). You can even fill out PDF forms or create your own form fields.

Cons
----
- User Interface A Little Non-Intuitive
The user interface is a little non-intuitive. For example, the All-in-One Search will only search for items in the active directory and sub-directories. The only way to specify which directory to search is to first change the active directory. (As you adjust to how the software works, it gets easier however.)

- Cumbersome Scanning
The scanning module allows you to create scan profiles (each saved profile is a set of customized scan settings) so you can quickly change settings between scans. That's all well and good, but the convenience is negated by the number of steps it takes to scan a set of documents:

First, you have to click on the scan button, which brings up a dialog. Then you have to click scan again on that dialog. After scanning, you have to close the dialog and click done on the main window, at which point another dialog pops up asking you to name the scanned output. Click done again to omit naming the file. Tooo...ooo many steps just to get something scanned!

- Quirks
The software has some quirks. Here are a couple of examples (number in parenthesis indicates severity of problem on a scale of 1-5):

(1) After an unsuccessful search, the app will ask whether you want to re-index your folder. If you answer yes, it goes into this ""preparing to index..."" mode and nothing seems to happen. The workaround is to simply invoke the indexing yourself by right-clicking on the folder in the Folders Tree and selecting ""Add to All-in-One Search.""

(3) The scrolling of PDF files is choppy and slow (using either the scroll bar or the hand tool). I compared the scrolling to Adobe Acrobat 9.3 and the scrolling in Acrobat is very smooth and *fast*.

- Not All Items Stackable
The only items that you can ""stack"" together are PDF (Adobe Acrobat) and MAX (Nuance PaperPort) files. You can't, for example, stack text files, excel files, etc. It would be very useful if PaperPort implemented a Binder (like Microsoft Binder, which was, unfortunately, discontinued after Office 2000).

1633,133,706,"Overview

This is a great array for someone looking to expand their home storage network or possibly someone with a SOHO setup that needs plenty of storage. I used this array to combine many different drives I had laying around from past system builds as well as to give me a central place to go for over 15TB of storage.

Unpacking

The array arrived well packed with two layers of boxes and internal Styrofoam.

Installation

You will definitely want to buy the optional rackmount mounting rails. The railkit costs approximately $32 more but was worth not having to sit the array on top of another rackmount device. There is no way the front brackets will hold the weight of the array empty let alone full of hard drives.

Hardware

All hardware was included. eSATA cables, SATA cables, power cables, drive trays, and drive tray mounting screws were included. The chassis is reasonably high quality metal, and I believe the power supply is a standard ATX power supply which is always preferred over some custom form factor so that if the OE PS dies you can get another one from anywhere. The array has plenty of fans, so far I have 12 drives in the array and no cooling issues.

The array is surprisingly quiet even when fully populated with WD Caviar Greens. The fans are barely noticeable to include the power supply fan. The indicator lights on the front are sparse but do provide basic information such as which drive bays are filled, which drives are active, and which internal RAID controller is active. A nice to have would have been a LCD screen with temp and other environmental info but at this price point its not surprising that its lacking.

One HW feature that I found totally cool was that you can bring your own eSATA port multiplying RAID controller card if you wanted, disable the RAID controller in the array, and use all of your own features with your own RAID controller card.

Software

The CD that came with mine was useless, trying to read it locked up two different laptops so I ended up downloading the latest software right from their website. The GUI interface for their drives and software is terrible, incredibly cheesy, and felt like something developed in the 90's, but it did install without a hitch and instantly recognized the attached array. Configuration of the RAID went without a hitch.

I did all of my configurations from a server running Windows Server 8 BETA x64 so I can say its not only Windows Server 8 BETA compatible its also 64bit compatible driver software.

A nice feature is that the HD's SMART monitoring information is available via the array's driver software.

Features

The amount of storage options this unit provides is awesome. I was looking for a budget eSATA rackmount enclosure with at least 8 drive bays and this unit definitely performs above and beyond my expectations. It offers all the usual RAID levels but the best part is that internally it is comprised of 3 separate RAID controllers which are accessible via 3 separate eSATA ports on the back so if you wanted to you could connect 3 different servers to this array. Also, if you choose to connect a device to the array that does not have a port multiplier eSATA port, you can configure the internal controller of the array to do the port multiplication for you and present a single logical storage volume to the connected device.

During my burn-in testing of my 2TB WDC Green RAID array I saw sustained writes of approximately 86MB/s and reads of approximately 98MB/s for a RAID 5 array of 4 1TB WDC Greens.

The Bad

The only bad thing about this array is the incredibly cheap hard drive carriages. You have to be very careful when mounting, inserting, or removing hard drives from this array. The carriages are very fragile, thin, plastic and will easily crack or break if handled roughly.  Once the drives are properly inserted into the array you should be ok.

Conclusion

This is a great budget minded eSATA RAID enclosure for anyone seeking a ton of drive bays, HW RAID controllers, and storage flexibilty for less than $1000.00. It certainly is not enterprise class, but then again, neither is the price.",software
1634,134,5671,"PDF Fusion is one of those pieces of software that you may, or may not, have much use for.  On the surface it seems like a great idea.  Create PDF files, from popular file formats (even if you don't own the original software).  Do many of the functions of Adobe Reader (set watermarks, set passwords, etc.). Assemble PDFs by combining multiple files from different formats. All these functions work well once you get use to the interface.  I was able to combine a Word doc, an Excel spreadsheet, a Powerpoint slide and some images into one PDF file.  The quality of the images and documents seemed fine (mind you I am not a professional photographer).

I really like the concept because in the past I have had to try to figure out how to import data from different sources into Powerpoint so I could print it all out together.  This made things much simpler.  My question, like others, is whether it is worth the price.  That really depends on how often you would use the program.  I'm sure if I thought about it I could find uses around the house, but I am not sure that would justify the price for me.  However, if you the idea of a simpler way to assemble PDFs is something you value, I think this is a valuable program.",software
1635,135,3422,"First I'd like to say this is a great product. Many reviewers say it's the best language program currently available - that might be true (I've only tried 3 or 4 programs). I agree with just about every positive thing said about the Rosetta Stone in the customer reviews.

That being said, I would never order it again. First, the price is just too high. My $10 ""Instant Immersion"" CD box set is definitely not as good as Rosetta Stone... but is it work $400 more?? I definitely don't think so.

The Instant Immersion is good enough, especially when paired with other resources, such as a pocket dictionary, &/or the Pimsleur system (which is also inexpensive, and very efficient). Many people tell me that Fluenz is very good as well. So for me, Rosetta Stone loses one star for price.

Second (the much bigger issue), the licensing issues are a deal breaker for me. I will never again order any Rosetta Stone product.

You can only load the program twice ... the intent (I believe) is to have a copy at home and at work. But if the first install is bad, or if your computer crashes, that's it! You have to buy another copy. I replace my computers (or hard drives) every 2 years on average. This severely limits my use of this product. This is pure greed on the part of Rosetta Stone, and unforgivable in my opinion. If I have a serial number, I should be able to have unrestricted personal use of the product.

Also, you can never, ever transfer ownership or sell it. Again, an unforgivable offense in my opinion. If you fork out $400-500 for this software, and end up not liking the full immersion style, then your stuck with it. (And hey, let's face it - all of our brains aren't wired the same.) This really, REALLY bothers me to think that this company doesn't mind ripping people off just because you learn differently. I love this learning style...but again, some people learn differently.

Finally, you have to have the original CD in place to use it - which means, you CAN'T use it at work & home unless you carry the darn disc around. For travel I use a portable netbook, which doesn't have a CD drive, so I absolutely can't travel with it. So the product loses another star for stupid licensing & other user restrictions.

So simply based on the merits of the product, I give it 5 stars. But based on licensing issues, greed, and limited user rights, I give is 0 stars. So if the price (& risks associated with product) don't bother you, by all means, get it & enjoy it. But if any of the problems I've mentioned give you pause, try one or more of the alternatives I mentioned.

1640,140,9162,"While Microsoft Office will likely always be the most popular office software suite, Corel's WordPerfect Office X7 is a comprehensive office suite that does everything Microsoft Office does, and more. And with the improvements of this latest version of WordPerfect, Corel has, in my opinion, presented several compelling reasons to consider switching from Microsoft Office to WordPerfect Office X7.

In this version of WordPerfect, the two main things Corel has done is update the user interface, and address Microsoft Office file compatibility issues. Microsoft file compatibility was a huge issue if you wanted to use previous versions of WordPerfect, and, in fact, its previous inability to work with Microsoft files was a deal-breaker for me. However, you can now easily work with all Microsoft Office files. And now where WordPerfect even betters Microsoft Office is in its ability to create and edit pdf files. For me, this is a HUGE plus, and this ability alone is a good reason for you to consider using or switching to WordPerfect. However, another very big advantage to this WordPerfect version is it also includes an eBook publisher and CD/DVD burning software. Nice!

If you're not required to use Microsoft Office for work, I would definitely recommend using this WordPerfect suite instead. It does everything that Microsoft Office can do and significantly more.

My computer was running so slow, I thought I needed a new computer until I removed my old IS software.  My computer started to run faster immediately afterwards, and didn't slow down when I installed Trend Micro Titanium.

All my software opens quicker, especially the internet.  It's more than twice as fast as with my old IS software.  All software opens on one click instead of three or four.  I can't believe I spent two years sloshing through mud with the old IS software.

Titanium has three settings:  1) Upload in full at start up (slows down start up); 2) Upload in part (start up is quicker - default).  Start up takes me only 3 minutes instead of 10; 3) Uploads only after start up is completed (fastest start up).

It takes up 259 MB of space, but says you need at least 500 MB for installation.

It allows for a Quick Scan which takes only 4 minutes.  This was a feature I missed with my old IS software.  With Titanium, you can choose to do a Quick scan, a Full scan or a Custom scan of specific drives.

The Full scan took 90 minutes.  Scanning slows the computer down...way down (which is why I took a star away).  That has not changed from my last system to this one.  I have yet to find an IS security software that I can use while surfing the net.

The software does not pop up with a reminder that I need to scan every time I turn on my computer.  Nor does it suddenly start scanning when I'm watching a video, causing the video to sputter.

You can see the brothers in the game, but you shouldn't even put them on the possible suspects, because they are your allies.  After all, they are the ones who invited you onto the train to help with the mystery.

Story-Lori Girard (think Paris Hilton) has invited several people on a train ride to help her find out what happened to the man who originally owned the train.  One day, he suddenly disappeared and his engineer was found on the deserted train, dead.  Suddenly, after Lori explains this and more to you and the other people, the lights go out, and Lori disappears!  Looks like finding what happened to the original owner of the train is on hold.  Now you need to find out what happened to Lori!

Graphics-They are better, but just by a little, like usual.  The characters are a little better.  The train cars are really drawn in detail, though.

Sound-Not that great music, but it's not THAT bad.  It's just not memorable.  The voice acting is pretty good, the actors/actresses actually sound like they are trying to sound like the characters they are portraying.

Gameplay-Everything is exactly the same except your cell phone has a camera feature to let you take pictures.  I thought that was a fun addition.

Fun-Everything is much more fun that the last game.  This game isn't as fun as some of the other games in the series, but it is definitely a big step in the right direction!

Length-The first time I played this game, I used a walkthrough (which I DO NOT usually do) and it took me 13 hours to complete.  Now, replaying it takes me about 9-10 hours.

It says it works for Windows 7 and it did install (although I needed to input my administrator password), but then we got a shock when we started the software.  Instead of getting the menu shown on the box to take a lesson, play games or whatever, our menu said only 'teacher' or 'student'.  Turns out the software was for a classroom.  The password required to set up the 'teacher' option, without which the 'student' option wouldn't work, was said to be in the administrative manual.  Unfortunately no such manual came with the software. I can only assume the wrong software was on the disk so we are left high and dry.

Photo painting transforms a digital photograph into a painting. You just import a photo and click on the auto-paint button, which transfers the image into any specified medium (oil painting, water-color, chalk drawing, etc.)

The interface is very well organized, with easy toolbars and many keyboard shortcuts. The Painter's tools allow image editing operations such as cropping and cloning, as well as adding touches like smearing brush strokes and bringing some photographic detail back into a painting.  You can manually trace and paint the image or use the auto-paint feature.

________
Old review: I have run only Norton antivirus products for the past 14 years, so I was hesitant but excited to compare Bitdefender when given the opportunity. My grandparents' computer was the perfect test subject. Comparisons are with Norton Internet Security 2008 which was previously loaded on the computer:

Bit defender installed easily without any problems, unlike many other reviewers' experiences. Make sure you have completely uninstalled all other antivirus software packages before installing bitdefender in order to avoid problems.

The program make little or no noticeable impact that I can discern on the speed of the computer while running in the background. However, I did not really have any issues with speed running Norton either. The complete scan seems to take longer than Norton to run.

Bitdefender seems to be a little easier for to customize, which is saying a lot since I am obviously familiar with Symantec configurations and was able to customize bitdefender's options with ease; very intuitive. If you have no desire or ability to autoconfigure; the default settings are load without asking a lot of confusion questions and seem to be appropriate for the average user.

The ultimate test for an Antivirus/firewall package is whether or not it protects against viruses and doesn't misidentify things that aren't viruses. I have never had a virus on any computer that I have had running an up-to-date Symantec product. It's hard to judge Bitdefender on this criteria by simply installing it. However, as I look at independent laboratory's assessments of the product, it fails to get 100% marks that characterize most of the other major Internet Security/Antivirus packages, whereas Symantec products regularly get 100% of viruses facing it. Generally, Bitdefender failed by misidentifying things as viruses which were not in the tests that I read.

Based on the laboratory tests and my past success with Symantec, I will be keeping Norton on my personal computers but will probably recommend Bitdefender as a low-cost alternative for family members who are at low virus risk.",software

1673,173,1302,"Finally, a security product geared towards the standard home user. It is not as user friendly as it should be for the home user, but pretty darn close. I am an independent developer and have been using the Beta and now the Live version on 4 different machines. So I have been able to see how well this performs. I have purposefully inflicted myself with various viruses and worms and it blocked them all with the exception of one. It was a newer one so that was exepcted. Norton did not block it either.

The first thing you have to compliment Microsoft on is the pricing model. The fact that this price covers up to 3 PC's in your household is perfect.  All you need is a Microsoft Passport which millions of people already have.  If not, it is easy to setup and you can use any email address to set one up unlike what another viewer said.

The other next to perfect feature is the functionality that forces you, the user, to update your PC with the latest and greatest Microsoft security updates. If you do not do it, Window OneCare will do it for you. This can be a huge annoyance having your PC reboot without you wanting it to, but if you really think about it, what better way can there be to ensure you are always up to date.  This goes hand in hand with the maintenance tools that run periodically to keep your PC running as well as it can.

As my subject says, this is perfect for the home user. The standard John and Jane Doe who know they should have something but have no clue what they need nor how to get it. They do not need hundreds of windows to open ports and block this and open that. They usually do not want to go on the Internet and download freeware/crapware for their virus solution.

Knowing Microsoft, this product will get better over time. And at this price for 3 PC's, you really cannot go wrong to give it a shot. It can be a pain in the behind uninstalling other software first (Norton can be a big pain to remove), but in the long run, it is worth it.",software

McAfee Live Safe works with Android, IOS & Kindle Devices (and pc's macs). So you won't have to worry about your smartphone,ipod, or tablet being compatible. McAfee LiveSafe is similar to other versions of McAfee and comes with a built in Virus software to help you protect against Malware,Spyware and of course other Viruses that may infect your device. It also comes with a slimmed down version of a Firewall called ""Web Security"" which you can switch on and off at will, however in my experience it has never interfered with anything I am doing online unlike some other firewalls so i always keep it on for extra security.

What is special about McAfee Live Safe is that it is a universal licensed product. Meaning that for 1 yr you can protect as many devices as you wish with only once purchase of the code. Unlike some protection software that only limit you to one or three uses you can use this on 10, 20, 30 devices if you wish.

1681,181,3079,"Bento is not a pro's database. If you expect the features of Filemaker or Access you'll be disappointed. But the last time I looked those programs were more than 4 times as expensive and targeted to an entirely different audience. For what it is and what it costs, Bento is pretty (expletive deleted) good. It's easy to use, easy to learn and well integrated with Address Book and iCal. With that integration it can quickly be massaged into a capable project management database. For those missing the database in Appleworks it is a definite upgrade.

I wanted a bird watching database that would include photos, recordings of songs, places, sighting dates, descriptions, related species and miscellaneous notes. I'm collecting information, not doing calculations this is a nice fit.

Within 45 minutes of installing the program I had my forms ready and was entering data. Being a designer, I went back and prettied up my forms a bit but that wasn't necessary. I went back and looked at the tutorials later and they seem pretty good.  My first inclination was to build the db in MySQL and put a web front end to it but that would be a lot of work. Bento was just what the doctor ordered. Bento is a little funky in the way it does joins but is a kind of relational database. But then I didn't want to mess with SQL anyway.

I would like to see some Applescript capabilities and a bit more flexibility in printing reports. I haven't tried to integrate Bento with Automator. With no Applescript dictionary, I'm not hopeful. But scripting a database is not something I would expect the target market for this app to even think of, or if they did, they would run screaming in terror.

1682,182,1326,"This is a very good PC emulator.  It runs very fast.  It uses Intel virtualization so it is able to run at near native speeds.  I have run many of the Microsoft Office products as well as Developer Studio on it, it works great.  A few things you should keep in mind:

** You Need a Copy of Windows

You will have to have your own copy of Windows to make use of this program.  I thought I was going to use an upgrade CD that came with one of my computers that I no longer use.  But Windows Genuine Advantage flagged it as an illegal copy of Windows, I guess it was licensed only for my old computer.  Anyway, I bought a new copy of XP(an upgrade) and it worked just fine.

** Special Drivers

Parallels comes with some special drivers that they recommend that you install on whatever operating system you are using.  This is not required.  You can run the operating systems just as you would install them on any other computer.  However installing the Parallels drivers increases performance.  One really nice feature is the mouse driver.  When the mouse driver is installed it allows you to simply drag the mouse over Parallels and click on things.  Otherwise, you must click on the window first and switch your focus to the virtual machine.

** Games

I have run into some problems where the game will install just fine, but it will refuse to run saying that you must put the game's CD-ROM in.  I assume this is because the virtual CD-ROM driver used by Parallels is not supporting the CD-ROM down to a low enough level to support the game's copy protection.  One game that has this issue is the Sim's 2.

Also the 3d graphics are NOT virtualized.  So any sort of 3d game will run as if you have no 3d acceleration hardware.  Which is slow.  Overall, the best way to run a game is ""boot camp"".

** Versions of Windows

I have used several versions of Windows on Parallels and it works great.  I have tested both Windows 2000 and Windows XP.

** Other Operating Systems

I have also used several flavors of Linux.  It works very well.  It really simulates a virtual computer, and you can install anything on it you like.

** You need RAM

Running this with less than 1gig of RAM can be painful.  If you want to run several virtual machines I would suggest up to 2 gigs.  However, one gig ran very well.

All in all this is a very good PC emulation and is quite fast.  I have uses other emulators, that are just deadly slow.  This one is quite usable.  If you don't plan to use this for games, you will be very happy with this product.  If you do want games its a little more hit and miss.  Better to use Boot Camp.",software

We all know about filing taxes, this software does that well.

However, about the pricing which most people seem to be talking about..

I don't have a problem with this move. Mostly because I only file one return, and I e-File. For me, this move saves me $5. The program has traditionally cost me about $20 (I buy basic), and then I efile, so my cost in the last few years was $35. Amazon is currently selling this for $30, so I'll save $5.

If I was someone who did multiple efiles then I might feel differently, but for me, this is a positive. I'm not naive, I can see where people might have issues with this due to situation. That I don't have a problem with.

However, a lot of the complaints I'm reading here are from people who seem to like to complain.  God help you if you have a positive opinion about something, you get branded stupid, your opinion is invalid. It seems that the only way you can be accepted anymore on the Internet is to have a negative opinion. Sigh.

1687,187,4320,"I have reviewed a number of products over the years for virus protection and general security. My major concerns tend to be in order: does it work (is it actually catching anything?), system resource usage (when active and in background), memory footprint (how much of my system memory does it use) - both of the last bear directly on the impact on other program performance - and lastly ease of customization.

On all counts this product has been a success in my opinion, it has reported numerous cookie and Trojans discovered over the past 6 months (highlighting risky websites before I traveled to them). It does tend to be a little more resource intensive while scanning than some other products I have used (both during active and background scans), noticeably slowing down other software. The memory footprint is small and certainly competitive with the best products I have used in the past. Customization of scan schedules, and trusted sites/senders is fairly easy, and certainly competitive.

Kapersky and Viper were past favorites for their small footprint, low impact of system performance and ease of use. I have panned McAfee and Norton for their piggish use of system resources and difficulty in customization. My overall feel for this product is that while it may not be what I would consider a best buy (mostly due to system slow down while scanning even in background mode), it is much closer to my preferred products than those I do not like and can comfortably recommend it.

1689,189,9788,"Installation of Norton Security on my Mac was very easy; in fact the only difficulty I had was getting the free version of Avast! uninstalled. From there, I ran a quick scan effortlessly.  However, once I had Firefox open, a Norton plug-in kept crashing. This didn't stop anything - there's a button to refresh  or to send a report. Either one fixed the problem and uncrashed Norton.  Still, it was annoying. I tried running the quick scan again and that totally solved the problem.

Macs are susceptible to vagaries of the internet; there's one insidious worm in particular that will try to fill your hard drive with junk. Fortunately, a friend does the IT work for the 15 Macs in his science lab and, after running a long scan with Norton, cleaned things up enough that he could identify the worm and remove it for me. (Since then, it's been added to Norton's fix-it capabilities.) He told me to get Norton and use it religiously. It saves a lot of hassle.

I've been a Norton fan since 1990, when I bought my first DOS computer and Norton Commander was the only menu system worth having.  I stuck with it through many PCs, until about 2005, when it became slow and bloated.  At that point, I tried other programs and was satisfied for the most part. Since 2011, when I went Mac (and won't go back!) I've mainly used free versions of Bit Defender (it's in the App Store) and Avast!, which is superior but slows the computer to a crawl several times a day.  Neither holds a candle to the ease and simplicity of the new Norton. It's more thorough and, of course, ad-free.  There are lots of customizable settings. You can do a quick scan, check one file, or do a long scan, which will run for a couple days. (I've done it once and intend to do it monthly in the future.)

Norton Security protects from malware, viruses, and spyware, among other things. It also has a complete blocker for your privacy and of course it's customizable. It can be added to other devices, like your smart phone or tablet and, if you do that, it's capable of locating them if you lose them. Pretty cool.  Also, if you replace a computer (or other device) the program can be moved to the new device without a hassle. That's a breath of fresh air!

This version of Norton Security comes with a product key you use to download the program the internet, and I really liked this because the key is printed on a card that I slipped into my wallet - for once, I won't lose my key!

1693,193,2373,"I ordered this item as I purchased last year a Toshiba Satellite that included a DVD Movie factory by Ulead that works pretty well, very cool templates and other functionalities that have allowed me to create very good-looking DVDs. There were some opportunity areas (for example, if you add a music file to a menu you have no way to edit the audio file or select a portion of it, I have to use Cool Edit to format the audio file to what I need) So I thought the retail version would have more functionalities than the one I already had and decided to get this one.

First of all I had no problems installing it, while I am stuck with the awful Windows Vista, installation ran smoothly and with no incidents. The software comes with a manual that I honestly have not used, the features are very easy to use and so far I have not needed to consult the user guide.

There are three applications and only two of them I have used, the one I haven't tried I really do not have a use for it which is to extract video files from a camera or similar device. I own a Sony DHC and I use the basic windows functionality to extract the files from it.

The first one I'd like to talk about is the video editing software included. While it may not have as many functionalities as the retail box makes you believe, it has some interesting features. First of all, it allows you to select an intro theme to your video which then you can add music to, same as the DVD factory I previously owned, there is no way to edit the audio you use in here, so say the intro is about 10 seconds and you add an mp3 file of over a minute, the song will play over the menu AND your video. There is a neat feature that allows you to trim your video and select the bits and pieces you want to keep or remove. What I liked the most is that this program offers the possibility of extracting video from a DVD and then edit the video on your own. I tried several of my home made DVDs and some of them worked and some others didn't, which is a shame but I believe it might be due to the way in which they were recorded, the ones that didn't work were recorded with a DVD recorder I got to copy my VHS into DVDs. I also tried some music DVD's I own playing with the idea of creating a music video compilation, well, it worked. What the program does is that it extracts the selected video track from the DVD into an mpeg file, from there you can edit it or keep a backup copy of it if you like.

After you are done editing and preparing your videos you can then create your movie. So far I have only created DVDs and VCDs and it has worked great, there are several templates included, some of them look very professional and some others look like they were made in power point, fortunately, the menus can be personalized and you can add/remove things to your taste. In the case of DVD menus there is a feature that allows you to edit the background music, something I really appreciated as I won't have to rely on an external program to do so.

Overall, a great product with some neat functionalities, I have lots of videos I have taken with my Sony camera as well as others I have downloaded and I am happy I got this product.

So when given the opportunity to use this full blown version I was geeked to see what it could do.

This version of WinZip is friendly like the old version and easy to use.  The interfaces have been cleaned up and appreciate that the developers have done what they could to improve what was a pretty seemless product.

The box also offered WinZip Courier 3.0, an sidecar program that creates smaller compressed files for email and file sharing.

What the program can't overcome are file size limits set by email service providers.  So for sending very large files (in my case, image files that I had to get to my publisher) I still needed to go through an online FTP service (YouSendIt), but there was for extremely large images for print.

My overall imporession is that this makes a great product for people who need it.  But for general computer user (those who use a computer for leasuretuime activities), I would stick to services that come preloaded with Windows 7.",software

1705,205,4074,"Unfortunately, Corel has not yet learned the lessons of consumer behavior these past couple of years.  If you want a program with a flashy installation screen, transparent splash screens, 2.3GB of hard drive space taken up and a whopping 32,443 items added to your registry then this is your program.  It's no wonder the system requirements are so steep.  As a CD and DVD burner, I see little difference between this and the many other programs out there (including freeware).  Its DVD player is fine, but frankly I already have one.  The video studio has no real outstanding features that are better than any other cut and paste video program except maybe the ability to add soundtracks and voiceovers.  It's almost embarrassing to have only four different animated titles available and the fourth can't possibly be used for anything other than baby photos.  Seriously, four only?

Help is only located online and the instructions they give are very simplistic with a very small index.  I don't see a link to where you can ask questions either.  It's not really a studio, just four different programs.  This becomes evident when the icons appear on your desktop along with a gadget to open the programs just in case you weren't smart enough to double-click the icons.  Of course you were never asked permission during installation.  Corel also reassigns all the media files (movies, music, and photos) you used to play on Windows Media Player, your photo viewer or whatever you were using to Corel's programs without your permission too!  I call all this stuff vomitware.  Wake up Corel!

Out of all of the programs I used, the only one I found useful was the photo-editing program. The blemish removal and the suntan tool are useful, although the fake suntan could get red and blotchy if not used properly.  The red eye tool is supposed to work on pets too but I didn't find this to be the case.  The straighten tool seemed to chop up the photo more than straighten it.  The fine tune tool (aka the quick fix) brightened up pictures and made some of the old black and white photos I was restoring look really nice.  Strangely it made color photos look too bright and a little over saturated.  In short, it's fun for beginners to play around with but it's certainly not professional quality.  You get a whopping six edges and seventeen frames for your photos in this program.  It's basic, but it is easy to learn and it may save you time over competing photo editors.

Personally I would look around for a program with lesser system requirements and more features, especially since Corel needs to get more options in the features they already have.",software

1715,215,1389,"Do NOT believe all the knee-jerk garbage you're hearing about Vista, as 90% of it is being pulled out of thin air by people who obviously never even tried it.  Linux and Apple trolls scour the internet for chances to add negative reviews to an operating system they'v never even tried.

Then there are the XP hypocrites who have been using XP for so long that they fear anything new.

Hypocrytes you say?  Yup.  This same negative ""new Windows sucks"" propaganda wave happened when Windows 2000 was released in 1999 (nobody wanted ""NT"") and again when XP was released in 2002 (incompatibility problems, verybody absolutely HATED that ""Made by PlaySkool"" interface). Everybody hated each of them until the next version of Windows came along. Then, suddenly, they LOVED the older version and tried to cling to it. Not only pathetic, but now very predictable.  Vista is just the latest victim.

I have absolutely no love affair with Microsoft, trust me.  But it's time for an actual professional with a masters in programming and operating systems to set a few things straight.

Fact: Windows Vista was in development a whole year before Windows XP was even released. Microsoft had been working feverishly on this OS for 6 years at the time of its release. Little id you know that nearly EVERY Microsoft product that comes out is extensively tested by a public usability testing program that is totally seperate from their beta testing program. Microsoft doesn't let anything out the door until all the usability testers (the general public that come to visit the Microsoft facility in Redmond, Wa) say they like it. Vista was OK'd by both internal and external beta testers in addition to the usability test program, or it never would have been released. I have personally done usability testing at Microsoft 17 times now (I like to get my 2 cents in), and I know how this process works. Microsoft releases software BY CONSENSUS, and Vista is what the people themselves ASKED FOR.

Fact: For its entire life, the virus magnet that is known as Windows XP has been solely responsible for the onslaught of spyware, malware and waves of viruses. Not Mac. Not Linux. Not DOS. Not Unix. It was Windows XP. Prior to XP, Windows would see a problem virus come down the pike once in a while.  Then XP came along, and we've been swimming in viruses and Malware ever since.  Even loaded with antispy and antivirus software, WinXP STILL gets infested and slows to a blue-screening crawl. As you read this on your XP box, I guarentee that you have spyware on your system. Run a scan and see for yourself.  If you're just running Windows Defender, I guarentee you're LOADED with it and don't even know it - get better software immediately.

Fact: Though complaints about Vista's UAC are many, the Internet is not filled with Vista users begging to be saved from viruses and spyware they can't recover from. Those poor souls are pretty much all XP users.  The Vista users complaing of any viruses and spyware are the ones who turned UAC off or clicked right past the UAC warning prompts without evn reading them.

Fact: OF COURSE Vista is going to be slightly slower than XP on the same machine - just like Windows XP was slower than Windows 2000, which was much slower than Windows NT4, etc. etc. This is the natural way things are SUPPOSED TO BE AS HARDWARE GETS FASTER AND FASTER. C'mon, what do you honestly expect? New operating systems are about new features, not ""running faster"" on the same hardware (anybody that knows anything about operating systems knows that new versions are NEVER faster than the previous version, no matter what operating system it is - just take a look at any Linux distro or new version of any Mac OS). It's up to HARDWARE to make things run faster, not the OS. Your system is not fast enough to run Vista? THEN GET FASTER HARDWARE LIKE YOU HAD TO DO FOR XP. Has everyone forgotten that today's hardware is anywhere from 4-10 times faster than than the hardware that was available when XP was first released? And that XP absolutely crawled on our systems when it first came out and that we all complained about it?  And that Vista runs at virtually the same speed as XP once booted up - only with tons of new features? And that soon you will need a new OS to even be able to operate the dual quads already on the market and the dual octo-core systems right arounnd the corner? C'mon, people, get a grip and get kick that common sense glad into gear.

Fact: Since SP1 came out, Vista runs GREAT. I can run any Win32 program I want in Vista that I install, and as of SP1.  I might even be able to run old 16 bit apps now, haven't tried that yet.  Thanks to the freeware release of VDMSound, I am running old DOS games under Vista with full sound.  I repeat - DOS games.  Some of the few remaining software products currently being described as ""Non-Vista compatible"" can be made to work under Vista if you do a little reading and tweaking.

Fact:  Before SP1 came out for XP, XP ran like crap and had tons of compatibility problems.  Everybody hated it, even the way it looks.  Bet you forgot that.

Fact: Turn UAC (User Access Control) off if you want Vista to behave like XP and not prompt you for confirmations. It's as easy as un-checking a checkbox in Control Panel (User Accounts). Note: This will drop Vista security down to the same ""virus magnet/pants down"" level as Windows XP, however, so you decide.  The nice part is that you CAN decide.

Fact: Are you a gamer? Then you already know that Direct3D (DirectX) 10 is Vista-only. All you XP gamers can sit in your own DX9 drool if you want to. Meanwhile, we Vista users are walking around in DX10 games that look like movies. You oughtta see Crysis with dual nVidias running SLI.

Fact: Think you don't like Vista? Waiting for Windows 7 to come out in Q1 of 2010 (at the earliest without any of Microsoft's now legendary and predictable postponements)? You might be interested in knowing that Windows 7 is merely a re-packaging of Windows Vista - just like Windows XP was a re-packaging of Windows 2000 because 2000 didn't sell well (see for yourself at the command prompt - type ""ver"" and take note that Windows 2000 is Windows version 5.0 and Windows XP is version 5.1). Windows Vista is version 6.0. Dig up all the screen shots of Windows 7 you can find on the internet - take note that the title is ""Windows 7"" but the version number is 6.1.  In other words, STILL VISTA. So get used to Vista. Better yet, GET Vista, or you'll eventually be two Windows versions behind when 7 comes out - which won't be until 2010 (at the earliest), and then that version of Vista will be around for 5 years until the next version.

Vista's here to stay, folks. You have a choice of slipping into even more obsolescence with XP (which is just Windows 2000 with lipstick, a 9 year old product) or you can move forward with Vista and Win7.

For me personally, Vista has been spoiling me rotten since SP1 came out. Every time I get up from my Vista machines and sit down on my XP machines, it feels like I'm sitting down on a machine in ""Safe Mode"". Vista makes XP feel old, limited, cumbersome and inadequate. The search functions of Vista alone remove all need for clicking through layers of start menus, even often allowing me to not have to touch the mouse - this alone makes XP feel like an antique. I won't even get into how cool Desktop Search is, SuperFetch, ReadyBoost, or the other many new features that make Vista MUCH faster than XP in many respects.  Read that last sentence again, and then look those things up.  You may commence drolling on your poor ol' outdated XP box's keyboard.

BTW: No, I do not work for Microsoft, and I have been a huge Linux fan since 1997 (SUSE Linux, to be exact, version 11 is fantastic).  I ignore the fact that Linux always takes much longer for apps to load up (and runs clunkier in general) and that both KDE and Gnome always seems to look/work a lot like the latest version of Windows.",software

1719,219,9470,"Im comparing Corel PaintShop Pro X7 (64bit) to the tool I use most, Adobe Photoshop CS6 (64 Bit)  both products running on Windows 7 64bit.  The first thing to point out, is that the Corel product is 1/10th the cost, and the Adobe product is now more regularly licensed as a subscription based product (a fee per month or per year per user).

The comparison boils down to, you get what you pay for.

Adobe offers many more options especially if you need to edit raw files, in which case you can manipulate and save (correct) a poorly taken picture much more easily with Adobes product than you can with the Corel product.

But for smart auto corrections, for all the basic editing that most people would want to do, this program has it, and I found that it worked just fine.  The down side is that you still need to learn this program, and if you have not already learned a photo editing program, Id recommend you go with one of the more basic Adobe photo editing programs, Photoshop Elements, because at least then you are learning a program than many (most) others will know, and in the event you decide to step up to a more sophisticated (expensive) Photoshop program someday, your learning's can just be added to, rather than started all over.",software

 Am I nuts? No. I use both programs sparingly and only when I want to a) achieve a very specific effect or 2) play.

 Tiffen DFX has an interface that only a masochist could love, but after some tinkering and manual reading, it is usable. Ultimately - and you should know this going  in - the learning curve is steep.

 What you begin with are 125 individual filters, each of which can be manipulated with sets of parameters. In other words, the possibilities are infinite. I have never, ever been able to open this program, do what I intended to do and move on with my life. Instead, each and every time, I get caught up in playing with the endless variations that are possible.

 There are other tools as well, particularly a masking tool from the original creators of the program.

 If you're serious about your photography - or just want to make Instagram effects look like pre-school exercises - you ought it to yourself to at least demo Tiffen DFX. It is available as both a plug-in for popular image editing programs or, as this, as standalone version.

I purchased this software about a year ago after using Namo WebEditor for years. In general I like the software. You can create web pages fairly easily, but, just like all software, there is a learning curve.

If you have used other web editing programs, you can't easily jump in and start working. For me, it was unlearning some things, because WP X2 works differently than Web Editor. In Web Editor, you create and save pages in html format. In WebPlus, you create pages (and the site) in their format and it only converts when you publish the site.

Other things work a bit differently, as well. Tables, for example, manipulate a bit differently than in most programs. To create a new page in WE you can just open a new blank page and start working. In WP X2 you have to create a ""master page"" first, even if it is a blank master.

1730,230,8096,"This is the first time I've gotten the Webroot Antivirus, as opposed to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Webroot-Internet-Security-Complete-2017-5-Devices-1-Year-PC-Download/dp/B00FZ0FK0U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Webroot Internet Security Complete 2017 | 5 Devices | 1 Year | PC [Download</a>].  That's due to the fact I will not pay more than $20 a year for internet security for two to three computers.  In past years, I've always gotten the Security Complete for actually less than that either here at Amazon or a last year version at eBay.  This year, the Webroot prices have not been that low at Amazon, and I fear getting older versions now due to Webroot's new policy of cutting off support to older versions. (A policy I cannot understand to save my live, regardless of how many times I read it.)  Also, this year the Antivirus was always $19.99 at Amazon for the PC download, until I needed it this week.  It actually went up to $39.99 the night I was going to buy it!  That made me think: Kaspersky here I come!  But Kaspersky went up this week, too.  (I've been checking the prices for both for weeks.)  Fortunately, I noticed the Webroot Antivirus PC disc was still $19.99; and why the disc would be cheaper than the download is beyond me.  Moreover, you don't even have to use the disc if you can't or don't want to when it arrives.  You can still download the software from the Webroot website, because all you need is the product keycode.

So, here we are . . . one difference I see between the Webroot Antivirus and the Security Complete is there is no maintenance button where you get rid of temporary internet files and such.  But I certainly don't need Webroot to do that little task.  There's also no firewall, but the Windows 10 firewall is fine with me.  (See comments below about a firewall.)  In addition, you can't put the Antivirus on cell phones or tablets, as you can with the Security Complete.  Once again, not a problem for me; I have a Microsoft phone that can't take a download of Webroot, and from what I understand about Fire tablets, no security software is needed.  Thus, one more hopefully happy year with Webroot.  I do really like Webroot.  It just stays quietly in the background and does its job, and does its job well.  Yet I'm not paying more than $20 a year for it for two or three devices, regardless of how much I like it.

P.S. Contacting Webroot tech or sale support is simple.  You just right-click the Webroot icon, choose ""help and support"", and then  you can easily contact them by clicking ""send us a message"" at the bottom of the page you are taken to.  You get an e-mail back when they have answered, giving you a link to click, which takes you to a page which not only includes your current question and the answer, but also all the other questions, with answers, you have ever asked Webroot.

It teaches language using multiple sensory inputs (picture & voice) and multiple feedback mechanisms (your voice and hand-eye choices).

1744,244,543,"This is my fifth year using Quicken TurboTax and it will be my third year using the state tax version. I'm sold on it. I can't imagine going back to pen and paper to do taxes. The program takes you step-by-step through the tax process by asking you questions about the various sections of the forms. It also prompts you to make you remember about things that may have slipped you mind, like other deductions. And, it makes suggestions for deductions that you may not have thought about. At the end of the process you can print out the forms for mailing in the traditional format or in a format that's easy for the IRS computers to read. In addition, you can opt to file electronicly. The help section IS very helpful. It actually makes sense of the rules and instructions for filing your taxes and explains the relevant sections of the tax code in easy to understand language. My one suggestion is that you have all your papers with you before you start the process. You can, of course, save your work and come back to finish or edit it, but it is a pain to be half way through and remember that your mortgage statement is two floors away.
I'm giving it three stars instead of five because of the product activation. Bad job Intuit. However, the activation doesn't prevent you from installing on more than one computer but it does prevent you from printing or electronically filing from the second computer. Still, you can take your saved file from work or where ever and bring it home to print or file.
I tried Taxcut this year because of the product activation on TurboTax. I had problems with it right off. It stated on the box that you could import TurboTax files but when I tried it wouldn't let me. The Taxcut web site suggested that this was a common problem and that you had to edit your TurboTax file (with TurboTax) to bring it down to a certain size. Still, it didn't tell you what that size was ok or really give you any idea on what to cut out. (I thought all of the our tax info was important).

It took some time to get adjust new taskbar but once I became familiar with the new interface, I found it to be an improvement over previous Windows versions.

1750,250,5538,"To start, it bears mentioning that I'm a previous Nuance (Dragon Naturally Speaking) customer, so I had no delusions about the company before selecting OmniPage 18. If you aren't a customer, then you should be aware that: 1) Their customer service is sketchy at best; 2) They'll nickel and dime you six ways from Sunday; and 3) If you give them your email address, they'll send you every Nuance-related marketing e-bumf from here to the end of time. With that said, after months of using OmniPage 18, here are my thoughts:

I have three operating systems across all of my computers: Windows XP, Vista, and 7, each with system requirements exceeding the minimum required for OmniPage. My goal was to try the software across each one, however, after dealing with the headache that was installation on the XP machine, I reconsidered. The autorun refused to automatically run, so I launched the set up file manually. After the software offered me a successful installation message, I launched it only to be greeted by a cryptic error message moments before the program crashed and closed. Rather than quit, I tried my hand at troubleshooting and discovered the problem--and it wasn't pretty. (At this point, I will note that Windows XP users should simply avoid this software, especially the technophobes.)

Once I had the software up and running, I gave the graphic user interface (GUI) a once over. It seemed rather simple and intuitive, but I quickly learned its appearance was deceptive if you intended to do more than a simple OCR conversion. (And by ""simple OCR conversion"" I mean clean black text on white background without images--usually of the kind originally created in word processing programs.) If you intend to use the extended features--for instance, a picture from your camera, or converting from a scanned book or a scanned document with an other-than-super-bright-white background--the trouble starts.

What's worse is that the help documentation goes so far as to be thoroughly unhelpful, possibly detrimental. One needs a healthy amount of patience, an inquisitive spirit without aversion to experimenting with software settings (which is why I told the technophobes to run away), and a pen and paper with which to create one's own help documentation as one discovers through trial and error how to complete certain tasks. (At this point, if this doesn't sound appealing to you and you need more than basic OCR conversions done on the default settings, then you'll want to rethink this software.)

The range of features this software touts is impressive and I wanted to test as many as I could before writing my review. I started with a PDF document that I originally typed in Microsoft Word. It was a plain document with plain Times New Roman text, no images, or tables--the fanciest it got was a header and a footer. OmniPage 18 converted this document into Word format beautifully, even with the header and footers intact and completely editable. Next was to try out a slightly more complicated PDF document conversion and I have to say, it passed, even where the tables were concerned. The only quibble was with the image positioning. At that point I thought maybe the software would be worth all the headaches to get it up and running. Then I moved on to converting *other* types of documents.

I printed a page on bright white copy paper from my first document and snapped a picture with my iPhone camera. I made sure the area was well-lit and the document was properly positioned in the iPhone screen. (Basically, I made sure I used optimal conditions, which is probably beyond what the average user might do, so bear that in mind.) The resultant document was vastly different from my first experience. About 30% of the converted text had errors and the corrections offered seemed completely random.

Next I worked on converting images I scanned directly from some books. OmniPage had a nice feature which allowed the automatic detection of the divider between two pages and that worked fairly well (that is, of course, if you can find it to use it). However, the book I scanned had slightly discolored pages and the margin of error for OmniPage went up considerably.

With the increased number of errors, the more interaction with the proofreading editor I had. That proofreading editor is not user-friendly or intuitive--at least not beyond the basic corrections. And finding a productive workflow is nearly impossible because many of the features that you'll need require multiple mouse clicks to access and then process. And Heaven forbid you actually make a mistake while doing the proofreading and need to go back because that will open up a whole new can of worms.

Even the files into which you can save your documents are unintuitive, because each one (even the same formats) vary slightly from one another, and there isn't any proper documentation as to the differences in each.

(By the way, the ebook format into which this program exports is completely horrid. Tip: export into HTML, clean it up in a different program, and then convert it using Calibre.)

However, the program does have a few redeeming qualities (hence the 2.5 stars instead of 1). It's clunky, sometimes unintuitive, borderline backwards, but once you get beyond this and find your groove, it has a few nifty features--the key is finding them.

So, to close...

For whom is this software? People who only need to do simple OCR conversions, or people who don't mind getting their hands messy when it comes to technical troubleshooting, people who have the patience of saints, and those who don't mind compiling their own documentation as they go along. Everyone else should probably look for something else.

I hope you found this review helpful and if you have any questions about the software or my experience with it, leave a comment and I'll do my best to answer.

ADDENDUM: When this review was written, the price of this software was significantly higher; while that didn't factor into my star rating, it was a poor cost for value. That said, if you can find this for under fifty, the cost for value greatly improves. (My original review still stands.)",software

1752,252,4184,"I used the Windows 7 Home Premium first as an upgrade and then as a clean install.

UPGRADE

As an upgrade from Vista Home Premium, it was seemless. I first used Windows 7 Adviser (download available free from Microsoft) to see which version of Windows 7 is right for me. One cannot upgrade willy nilly from any version of Windows to any version of Windows 7. Then, I used Windows Easy Transfer to migrate my data to an external hard drive. I don't think I needed Easy Transfer for the upgrade from Vista, but it came in useful later, when I had to do a clean install.

Upgrading went very smoothly. I retained all my software and settings. I really loved how easy it was.

WINDOWS EASY TRANSFER

It may interest some of you to know sysprep will not work on a computer with an OEM version of Vista with a paid upgrade to Windows 7. I could not even perform a Windows repair with the full version disk. Nope. Once I changed out my motherboard and CPU, I had to use this full version to do a clean install, after which I ran Windows Easy Transfer. Windows Easy Transfer did not restore all my software or even my email settings, but I did give me back my wallpaper.

CLEAN INSTALL

I had to do a few clean installs: the first time after upgrading my motherboard and CPU, the second time after upgrading my hard drive (cloning the old drive failed and my disk backup image did not work). I know, I should have done it all at once.

The first clean install was flawless. The second clean install was fraught with problems. Windows would not let me repair nor do a clean install. ""On EFI systems, Windows can only be installed on GPT disks."" Lots of googling to solve this problem, and I did not find anything like what I finally did: I went to the ""advanced"" screen of the Windows setup screen and deleted all the partitions. That worked.

WINDOWS 7 VS. WINDOWS 8 AND VISTA

Compared to Vista, Windows 7 is very familiar. It feels stable. I haven't had it lock up or anything. I like the taskbar on the bottom of the screen. I like being able to see small screenshots of my work by hovering over the icons there. I like anchoring my most used software there.

We do have Windows 8 at home and I chose not to upgrade to that. Windows 8 is very cluttered and clunky. Everything takes far too many clicks, like taking a roundabout route just to turn off the machine. I consider Windows 8 a downgrade.

This unit allows you to cable your Multi-zone  VHS ( or multi-format, like PAL, NTSC [several types ), and SECAM etc) into a digital CD or DVD.You can do PAL VHS tapes into DVD, and Audio formats  on Cassette tape on to CD. The best editor to use is an AVID Studio suite software, but there are various kinds of software available that will work. For me, whilst the original VHS containers are my main collectors item, it is hard to use them regularly if they are not in a format that can play on a digital disc format. VHS is cool for collection, as is the Vinyl, but the need to convert the items is purely a practical purpose.
  The previous version of this adaptor came with the Roxio suite, but the Hardware is basically very good such that it can be used with many formats. Roxio covers most of your audio formats, but suites like AVID 12 and above, can cover many video styles, as well as the menu format if you need to convert that and put it together in a new disc. In many respects, this conversion hardware is a life-saver because when audio tapes get close to the dying point ( tape too tight in audio or VHS ), and you need to have a VHS tape with content saved, this will help to save that content. Especially tapes with unique audio or video content that is never transferred to  DVD or Blu-Ray. Also the right software can clean up audio as well as Video. Sometimes this takes time, but sometimes the ROXIO software, as in audio, can process audio content to save it, and in the AVID Suite can help you save unique Video.

1760,260,8205,"Having been a long time user of Norton and been through some of the good versions and bad versions from a few years back that was bloated, slow and a memory hog, I stuck with Norton. In recent years and recent versions, Norton has streamlined their protection suite and made it less intrusive and less of a processor/memory hog than it use to be. For me, I was using the 2013 version before upgrading to the new 2014 version and while I consider this one of the best computer protection programs out there (in fact, McAfee bought the older virus scan engine from Norton a few years ago because they couldn't build anything better themselves), the 2014 version is only a minor upgrade from the 2013 version I was using.

Symantec's Norton 360 2014 includes a load of protection technologies including antivirus, anti-malware and anti-spam provision, and a good two-way firewall among other things. It also offers a number of extra features aimed at web browsers and mobile devices such as my Android, Norton Mobile Security includes anti-malware, anti-theft, backup and call/SMS blocking.

Norton's interface is a bit bland this year with yellow boxes on a white background with each labelled Security, Identity, Backup and Tune-up Click on any of the blocks and it moves up to reveal a five item menu and if you want more detail, switch to Task view, which breaks down many of the available protections into individual tasks.

One of the best advantages to Norton is that it updates itself every 5-10 minutes in what they call Pulse and safe Web installs into your web browser to provide browsing protection while you surf the net.

One of my favorite things about Norton 360 is Norton Utilities. One of the best ways to keep your computer from slowing down and being bloated is the Tune-up feature that keep your PC cleaned up from leftover files and broken registry entries along with disk optimization, a diagnostic report and a start-up manager. Start up manager allows you to switch off applications that have set themselves to start when your PC does, placing a load on the system that you may want to avoid. Although I found the startup manager pretty similar to doing it yourself through windows, it does provide a simple easy interface for those more novice users.

Norton 360 has a performance view, where the control panel flips and shows events such as downloads which have taken place in the last three months, and the usage of disk and memory on a variety of timescales. These views I found to be limited in their usefulness but can be beneficial if you're trying to isolate a change in your system's performance and correlate with some event.

Symantec provides 2GB of online storage for backup which seems a bit puny compared to other solutions out there. I for one, don't really utilize this feature as my machine has plenty of backup storage.

The scanning speed and efficiency from the 2013 to 2014 versions seem to be very similar with maybe and I say maybe a slight speed increase in the 2014 version.

One of the differences that I notices was power eraser is now more integrated into the suite. Although I have never had an issue and needed to use it, it seemed like a heavy hitter at cleaning out rootkits, although you do have to reboot your machine to be able to scan and do its thing. The one time I tried it, it did alert me to my java being out of date, which I didn't realize, so there was some benefit to at least running it.

One of my past complaints is the yearly renewal feature that cripples the software if you don't renew and that is still a bit of a gripe to me but at least now you can find this suite for a reasonable price than what it use to be.

Installing Norton 360 or in my case upgrading to the new version usually is smooth but I did have a hiccup where I rebooted my machine and though that the program didn't properly install, but in my case it stalled for a few before completing the installation without any further issues.

Pros:

Excellent blocking of dangerous websites
Powerful, intelligent firewall
Accurate spam filtering
Great antivirus and pulse keeps you constantly updated
Great PC tuneup feature
Minor impact on system performance

Cons:

A minor upgrade to the 2013 version which is good on its on merits
Limited usefulness of some of the features, such as performance view.
only 2 gigs of online storage
Yearly renewal
Installs are not always smooth

Even with only minor tweaks, Norton is still one of the best choices of protection software out there and if you can find it for less than 30 bucks it is a good value for money.

1762,262,8639,"I used TurboTax Deluxe 2013 to calculate my anticipated tax burden and potential refund the day after receiving my last paycheck of 2013 (of course I will re-evaluate it once we get our actual W2s). If you filed last year with TurboTax 2012, yes, it is basically the exact same program. But the behind-the-scenes stuff gets updated with new forms and tax laws, etc. I'm sure all of that costs plenty to keep up with, justifying having to re-buy what seems like the same program every year. Though it does beg the question, could we maybe just buy a single TurboTax and pay each year just for the updates and to e-file, instead of re-buying nearly identical software, and a new box and disc and updated marketing, etc. But I digress.

I file Married Filing Jointly and have a pretty simple tax situation (wife and I each have one job, no kids, standard deduction). And for this purpose it was EXTREMELY easy and simple to file. I've used TurboTax since 2011, and I really like how it imports the previous year and unless anything major has changed, you basically just swap some numbers around and you are DONE! I probably spent less than 10 minutes importing my 2012 return and updating it for 2013. Since I've used TurboTax for the last 3 years, it also shows you a tax history with your history of income and taxes. It's kind of fun to see a trendline over the years, especially if it is (hopefully) in the upward direction.

What I also like, is switching back and forth between the ""hold my hand' version of the software and the raw tax forms. Some of the questions and situations TurboTax asks me about, I am curious what actual tax basis there is to the question. So after I fill it out, I switch to the forms and see exactly which fields on which forms are being populated based on my answers. It can help you understand tax filing much better to actually look at all the forms being submitted rather than relying solely on the user-friendly walkthrough version. But if that stuff doesn't interest you, it seems accurate and reliable enough to not really need to fret too much over it either.

Make sure you look at the difference between the TurboTax versions (Basic, Deluxe, Premier, Home & Business) so you don't leave tax deductions/credits on the table. Deluxe was what I needed, but depending on your situation it may benefit you to pay a little extra for the pricier ones. If you have a pretty simple tax situation and could file a 1040EZ, the cheapest basic one could be all you need. If you are self-employed, own a business, trade stocks, I would look into the Premier or Home & Business options.

If you are new to TurboTax and will not have anything to import from last year, it takes a little longer, but it is still pretty quick to enter everything in. I could maybe do mine from scratch in 20 minutes. Granted, many people have all kinds of deductions and credits or self-employment details (or if you bought/sold real estate or stocks etc.) that could drastically lengthen the time it takes to go through the process. But all I know, is for me personally, this product is simple, thorough, and exactly what I needed. I fully intend to purchase TurboTax again next tax year.

FYI: The IRS will not process returns in 2014 for tax year 2013 until after January 31st, so don't feel too rushed to buy this and file immediately, as you will still need to wait until *at least* February for any possible refund.",software

1768,268,8090,"I used Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing many, many years ago on a Commodore 64 when I was a teen.  I remember reading about it in either Compute! or Ahoy! magazine.  Back then, the Dvorak keyboard layout was a popular alternative but I got the product back then to improve my typing skills.  It did work back then...so when I saw this product I thought I would continue the tradition of improving typing with my own family.

First, Mavis beacon is not a real person - it is a fictitious character designed to inject some life into a typing program.

The latest version of Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing touts the use of a new technology called UltraKey.  UltraKey is actually a standalone typing tutor / engine you can purchase...so it appears that Mavis Beacon has partnered with the makers of UltraKey to enhance their product line.

What you get with this product is 330 typing exercises with 12 interface themes.  This is basic instructional typing software that teaches the fundamentals of the keyboard.  You progress in a systematic manner from basic instruction to words, sentences, then paragraphs.  You can see virtual hands which mimic motions on a virtual keyboard.  Stopping to correct mistakes deducts from your typing speed rather than some typing applications which make you continue on and chastise you for making mistakes.  You also get some pointers on posture which I didn't heed as I am touch typing this review while hunched over a darkened keyboard.

Product support comes in the form of an online user's guide, ability to email for help and some videos and FAQs.

Unfortunately, this product is licensed for just one user and computer.  This is a downside to me because we have several laptops in my home which are used somewhat interchangeably.  Many software installs these days allow for more than one user / computer.

Overall - you get graphical and usability improvements galore over the old C64 version of this software which is only mentioned for amusement.  I think this product is an effective aide at improving typing efficiency and skill.  It is far better to learn properly up front versus trying to retrain yourself to type after you've already learned the wrong way.

Last year when using another Intuit product (Turbo Tax)that I've used for almost equally as many years, I could not install some of its features.  I called Tech support but they could NOT HELP solve the problem either.

When I purchased Quicken 2008 and to upgrade from 2007, every thing went along well until the last few closing installation sections and the entire installation had to be uninstalled.  Tech support again was of no help.  They ran out of ideas after I spoke with 2 different levels of support and finally suggested I call Microsoft and see if they could help me.  (My computer runs fine, is not out of date in RAM, ROM, hard drive space, memory, etc.

I think that Intuit's copyright protections on Quicken and Turbo Tax were the cause of my installation failures with each of the above programs.  I will be using  Tax Cut for my taxes this coming year also.

1774,274,7359,"As the happy owner of a new digital camera, it seemed natural to install some video editing software so I could play with my home videos a bit. Having used Corel's software in the past, I looked forward to trying VideoStudio Pro X6.

I've never edited video before and I've also never had a video camera before. I am very proficient with technology and computers, as my career is in IT. Based on past experience with other Corel products, I expected VideoStudio Pro X6 to be a bit more intuitive than it has been so far. Again, I am a complete novice at video editing, so perhaps this is part of a learning curve for me. Until I've had more time to learn and experiment, I'm giving the software a neutral rating while I tell you what I have experienced already.

The install went very smoothly. I put it on my laptop running Windows 7 Ultimate with 16 GB of Ram and an i7 processor. Launching the software is also smooth and the software doesn't take long to load on my PC.

Corel presents you with a mini help window when you first launch the software. The `Home' tab has information and links to helpful items, including a link to check for software updates. The `Learn' tab has helpful training videos. The `Do More' tab has a number of downloadable add-ons, many of which are free. And the last tab is for `Messages'.

There are also very thorough user guides you can download from their website. Normally, I find most software easy to figure out and refer to such manuals for extra tips and information I couldn't figure out on my own. It is apparent I will need to go through this one page by page to learn how to use this software. It would be nice if they had some tutorials that took you through various tasks step by step. There may be such but I haven't found them yet if there are.

So far, I've been able to get video clips into a project, although that took quite a bit of time for me to learn. The import function I found in the `Capture' area does not work as I had expected it to. Now that I have a video clip in the software to work with, I'm working on learning how to edit it and in what ways it can be modified.

As I said before, I am granting it a neutral 3-star rating for now. I had expected this software to be more intuitive - I've had no trouble learning Corel's photo editing software. Once I've worked with the software a bit more, I will adjust my rating however it is warranted and add the new experiences to my review.

1783,283,3953,"Back when I did my 2005 taxes, I swore I would never go back to TaxCut.  I had a harrowing experience with the program including software bugs and crashes, inadequate interface, missing schedules, and a nightmare with deduction pro.  To top it all off customer support was virtually non-existant.  When I did get through they were unable to help me.

When I received a free copy of TaxCut 2008 Premium Federal in the mail with 'Free! We want you back"" blazoned on the CD jacket, I was leary but then thought, 'what the heck. It's free, I'll try it.'

PROS:
1. Competent tax programt that has come a long way--now comparable with
TurboTax (in the past this was not the case)
2. Reasonable interface
3. Reasonably priced
4. Federal forms worked smoothly
5. INCREDIBLE customer support via webchat; BETTER than TurboTax
6. Much improved DeductionPro
7. Easy e-file

CONS:
1. I think TurboTax still has the edge...
2 Poor integration with state forms
3. So-so interview for state forms
4. Poor help files for state forms
5. DeductionPro not as easy to use for non-monetary donations/deductions as TurboTax's It'sDeductable
6. Key codes needed for e-filing weren't included in my version.  They were easy to obtain from customer support, but this was an unnecessary annoyance.

So try it, I did and I was pleasantly surprised. I am comparing this to last year's experience with TurboTax, as I was satisfied with TaxCut and went with it.  On the whole, the Federal tax experience is excellent, however, the state tax experience was less smooth.  (See below)

Bear in mind that I do not have an overly difficult return to file.  No major investments and not very complicated itemized deductions.  I did move this year so I had two state forms to fill out and did sell and buy a house.  Other than this, pretty simple and standard.  I completed the taxes on an iMac, so this may be somewhat different than the Windows version.

THE INTERFACE:  For starters, my TurboTax information from last year imported with out a hitch.  The questions were simple and to the point. There are fewer fill-ins per screen than in last year's TaxCut.  My guess is that it took a little longer than last year, but that may have had to do with the increased complexity of my taxes.  One caveat here is that you have to answer the questions carefully, as missing one will result in missing one part of your tax.  In comparison with TurboTax, TaxCut's interview questions are a little less clear.  Double checking and knowing your finances does solve most problems, but care must be taken to make sure you don't miss a schedule or a life event.  On the whole this was easy, but I'd give a slight edge to TurboTax here.

On the whole, the feature sets are similar between programs.  I would have to say, that TurboTax is somewhat slicker.  TurboTax allows you to download some W-2s electronically--I did not see that option in TaxCut.  TurboTax has better integration between help files and the interview and also allows for easier navigation between sections on the tax forms.  But TaxCut is no slouch and was adequate to the task.

DEDUCTION PRO:  This is gobs better than TaxCut 2005.  I like the fact that the program is installed on your computer, making it more responsive than the TurboTax equivalent.  (It'sDeductable!, from TurboTax, is an online program.)  It was easy to input various charities and non-monetary donations.  DeductionPro has a 'calculator' for non-monetary donations, but once you calculate the value you have to manually input it into DeductionPro.  The TurboTax version allows you to calculate the value and then directly inputs it into the spreadsheet--a much smoother operation.  Unlike my past experience with DeductionPro, the deductions were quickly and easily imported into TaxCut.  If you revise your deductions and reimport the file, TaxCut now has a failsafe to prevent you from deducting the same things twice.  Much better than 2005.  If you have a lot of non-monetary deductions, TurboTax would win the competition.  If you have mostly monetary deductions, TaxCut's interface is better and, given that the program runs on your computer, there is no need for passwords and no time lags that can happen on web-based programs.

FINAL AUDIT:  Both programs seem to have reasonable audit features and bring you to the area of the forms where there are questions or problems.  No difference here.

E-FILING: There are 5 free e-files on TaxCut and the process went without a hitch.  Both programs work well in this respect

CUSTOMER SUPPORT/PROBLEMS:  I had to contact customer support 3 times with TaxCut.  Each time, I used their webchat interface.  My longest wait for an customer service rep was 10 minutes.  Each time, the customer service rep was courteous, helpful, and solved my problem.  This is MUCH MUCH BETTER than what occurred in 2005 when customer service was virtually non-existant and unable to help.

Problems included:
1. The need for a Key Code in order to e-file.  Key codes were not included with my program (unclear why).  I needed a keycode for both the federal form and the state forms.  These were supplied by the customer service rep.
2. Inability to remove an inappropriate schedule from a state form.  I was walked through this with a service rep
3. The CD I received did not have DeductionPro bundled with it.  Customer service gave me a download link for the program.  (This may be a glitch in the Apple/OSX version of the program)

Each time help came quickly and easily.  TaxCut gets 5 stars for live 24 hour help.  Last year's TurboTax help was okay, but nothing to write home about...

STATE FORMS:  This is where TaxCut takes a bit of a dive.  Based on my experience with the Federal forms, I bought and downloaded the state forms.  All I needed were the key codes (as noted above) which were absent after the download.  These weren't sent via email, but I knew about this when I requested the codes for the federal forms and received the key codes for the state at the same time.

The state forms are less well integrated with the federal forms than I remember from TurboTax.  I never had to complete two forms with TurboTax.  Suffice it to say, the NJ form was easier than the PA form (which is strange because PA is a flat percentage of your income).  The state forms did not integrate with each other at all.

The PA and NJ forms did import information from the federal forms and W-2s, but did not take the information about my move from the beginning of the TaxCut interview.  I had to input this information into the state forms and actually had to do this separately for each state as the state forms do not integrate with each other.  The same was true for salary collected from one state while my primary residence was in the other.  I had to input redundant information into the program.  It's hard for me to compare this with TurboTax as I had only used TurboTax with a single state before.

The state forms did not have thorough interviews.  Some information had to be typed directly into the forms themselves.  Not specifically a problem, but in the tax software business, the interface is the most important thing.

Finally, the state help files were not as thorough.  Especially for PA, I found myself downloading files from the PA state site in order to review instructions for filling out the tax forms--a major glitch in the TurboTax state forms.

One major problem:  the PA form imported the sale of my home from the federal taxes.  The problem is, sale of a primary residence is not taxable in PA unless some part of the home is used for commercial purposes (or a few other exceptions).  After researching the instructions and downloading PDFs of the PA forms from PA state, I realized that this was the case.  Needless to say, TaxCut calculated a massive underpayment and I was unable to delete scheudule D without consulting customer service.  (As it turns out, I had to delete the schedule D 'worksheet' and then delete the forms.  If you try to delete the forms themselves, nothing happens...)

SUMMARY:  On the whole, I was pleasantly surprised with TaxCut.  Would I use it again?  I suppose I would.  TaxCut was a bit more rough around the edges to use than TurboTax, but beat TurboTax hands down with their customer support.  I would say that these programs are both good ways to do taxes.

On the whole, however, I was pleasantly surprised by TaxCut this year.  Would I have used it if I hadn't received the federal form free? Probably not.  But I will have to think about whether I will stick with TaxCut next year and the program was good enough to get me thinking.",software

To use a restaurant analogy, this bundling of stripped-down photo and video applications reminds me of the fixed-price appetizer-entree-dessert bundling that restaurants sometimes offer to entice diners to eat a meal there at a more moderate price than had they chosen whatever they wanted from the a la carte menu.  The bundle of applications included in this suite is actually very usable for photo and video beginners: VideoStudio Express for video editing, PaintShop Photo Express for performing basic one-click-does-it-all sorts of photo editing, WinDVD for playing DVDs and videos, DVD Factory for burning DVDs, and Instant Viewer photo viewer/browser.

For photo or video beginners, I rate this collection of applications that is oriented towards spoon-fed ease of use 4 stars.  However, my main reservation (no restaurant pun intended) to this collection of software is that if you are either an intermediate or (especially) advanced user of photo or video editing software, or if you are a beginning user of this software who wants to progress into advanced ""power user"" levels of features, you will soon hit a wall with the limited set of tools and functionality that the VideoStudio Express and PaintShop Photo Express, in particular, provide.

If you foresee yourself diving more into advanced both photo and video editing capabilities, I would skip a bundle like this and head straight for the higher learning curve, and likewise higher ability, of Adobe Photoshop Elements or even Corel's own CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X4 is far more powerful, albeit more expensive.  But in a way, the ""you get what you pay for"" law still applies here.  There are likewise far better video editing software out there, both commercial and free.  But as a beginner-level package for people who either are less literate with using software or do not care to tinker too much with their photos and videos, this is a pretty good and useful bundle.",software
1788,288,8206,"The name is confusing...this is Norton 360 Multi-Device Premier Edition

I've used Norton for a few years now & haven't had any problems with it. One thing I try to remember each time I boot up my laptop is to make sure my security program's icon shows in the toolbar. Years ago when I was using either McAfee or Norton (I don't recall which one anymore), I noticed that the icon was missing in the toolbar. I investigated & figured out that my PC was hit by some kind of virus or trojan or malware...I have no idea which one, but that virus turned off my anti-virus scan schedule. Nothing was harmed, only me having to find the virus file that needed to be deleted. From that day forward, I'm always careful to make sure my security program is working.

Once Norton 360 is installed, you have many configuration options. Click on Norton's icon to open the program. You'll find all the program's features & settings which will give you options to set the program up to your preferences.

Amazon's Product Description is very thorough. So check it out to learn everything Norton 360 Multi-Device Premier Edition can do for you.

I should've known better, but I spent way too much time trying to install this edition of Norton on my Kindle Fire HD only to learn that the Fire isn't supported by this program. So I went to Amazon's App store & found Norton Mobile Security (it's free). I decided to read some reviews before I installed it on my Fire...that's when I decided I wasn't going to install it.  The reviewer installed it on his Fire, & subsequently was blocked from purchasing books. He had to do a factory default reset to remove Norton Mobile from his Fire. I've had to do 2 factory default resets &  didn't enjoy either one. So I won't be installing Norton on my Fire.

I haven't experienced any problems with this program & will update my review if my opinion changes.",software

It does not slow down my computer and works in the background without me having to deal with it constantly on a daily basis. It has kept my computer clean.  I will admit that I do not go to a lot of websites where you might pick up something, I stay on well known sites that I am sure are clean, but I have strayed over accidentally to other sites and I have gotten attacked, but Norton has been able to stop the attack before it does any damage.",software

I have barely even noticed Kaspersky... it does it's job without any interference for me, and I have not noticed it slowing down my computer at all. This is a huge plus to me, I don't have the time to be bothered with a program's settings; but neither do I want it to slow my computer down.

1791,291,6387,"Longtime ancestry.com members with Macs have been waiting for this software forever, because Ancestry has treated them like their platform doesn't exist until very recently.

""Is this good software for making a family tree?"" Yes. No. Well...

Right off the bat, Ancestry is going to make you call them and talk to a customer service rep to get your six months of free service. If this sounds like an upsell opportunity, you're right. Expect to be hounded for the more expensive ""global"" membership, which is not included. And heaven forbid you already subscribe (as I did), because they'll do absolutely nothing for you, other than tell you to cancel, then call back when your account stops working and get the six months.

And where most genealogy programs that aren't Family Tree Maker for Mac will let you own your own data, there's an expectation that you're going to continue paying Ancestry for a subscription. I'm mildly surprised they haven't branded it ""Family Tree in the Cloud"" yet. But in any case, without a connection to ancestry.com, Family Tree Maker doesn't do a whole lot.

1803,303,46,"I have to admit that one of my paranoid fears is that my computer will crash and that I'll lose all of my files and projects that I've spent a long time working on. One positive feature of Office 365 is the SkyDrive which enables you to save your documents and projects to the cloud and access them from other locations. I also like that 365 makes it possibly to easily collaborate on projects by inviting others to access the document. The other person does not have to have the same version of Office that you do, it can pull up the document in a browser and they can view and make changes as needed. You can also work on SkyDrive documents when you're offline and then they'll update when you have an internet connection again (BUT if the document was updated at another location and you don't have internet access, then you won't be accessing the most up-to-date version, which I view as a bit of a liability.) I have been known to save important documents to both my SkyDrive and my computer just as a back-up in case the Internet gods decide to shut up the data heavens.

An added feature of Office 365 is access to Office Mobile Apps. Unfortunately, my smartphone (HTC Desire) is not compatible with the Office Mobile App and so I can't make use of the mobile features. However, the subscription does include the option of adding up to five mobile devices (but I imagine they have to be fairly recent mobile devices or you might run into the problem I had of the device being incompatible with the app). I was kind of bummed that it won't work on my device. It would have been convenient to be able to access my documents on the go, but oh well, what can you do.

Installation is fairly easy. You just go to the website, enter the product key and connect it to your Microsoft account (or you can start an account with any e-mail address). It will let you download the software on up to five computers, BUT as the name Office 365 indicates, you will only have access to the software for 365 days. After that point you will have to pay all over again for another year's access to the software. The positives of that is that you will always have the most up-to-date Office software (automatic updates are included in the subscription), but the obvious con is that you'll be perpetually paying for a subscription. Honestly, my personal preference would be just to own the software outright (I'm OK with not having the latest and greatest version). They do throw in a few extra perks to help lessen the pain of an annual subscription: Skype 60 minutes a month world calling & SkyDrive with 20 GB storage.

It did take a little while for the program to download, but if you have any experience with Office products, it is pretty easy to find your way around. I do like that you have the option of downloading on up to five computers and five mobile devices, but you do have to be prepared to repay for the right to access the software annually. If you're OK with that, then I think you'll enjoy Office 365. It's user-friendly and helps bring accessible technology to our society that's increasingly mobile and connected. I like that my documents can go with me wherever I am.",software

Also, the conversion between MAC and PC platforms is not very user-friendly, especially when it comes to using Powerpoint.

I am not a pro on either, though I can get them to do what I want.

I installed Corel PaintShop Pro X7 on a Windows 8.1 64-bit computer without any problem.  I was able to update it, also without problem.

For the price, this program will allow you to do most everything a regular user would want to do using Photoshop, at a much more affordable price.  You can make all the basic corrections that will turn a poorly composed image into a gallery-worthy one.

Sorry, I have not tried this product yet on a Windows 8 PC and I don't know how well this really does on a tablet or smartphone.  Norton used to be really good and then got bloated (slowed down PCs in the 1990s and early 2000s) but in the past 5 years or so I've been impressed again that it's footprint is not bogging down the machines I've put it on.

So do you really need this bundle? for your tablet and smartphone too? or do you just need their basic product for your PC?  You decide.

I am still disappointed that once you install any of these products, from Norton or from the other pay-per-year products (i.e.,McAfee), that once you purchase and install them, a year from now they will ask you to renew at a very high costly rate.  Sure, they might say they are offering you a discount, but if you just came back here to Amazon and bought a new copy of the same program, or the next year's version from that same company, chances are the price to get a new copy would be FAR less than renewing or re-upping the program that's on your PC for another year (especially if you watch for a deal).",software

1822,322,946,"It has been said that the biggest cause of stress and anxiety is caused from a perceived disconnection from the Divine--either within oneself or in the universe at large.

We are finally realizing that our thoughts, emotions and physical body have an etheric counterpart that registers our bodily states. Attending to our spirits promotes peace, health, and a sense of well-being. The effect of stress and anxiety on our bodies is well documented. Likewise, studies are showing the powerful effects of prayer, meditation, and joy on our emotional and physical health.

Kurt Smith and Corwin Bell of The Wild Divine Project are two visionaries who have developed a groundbreaking tool that engages mind, body and spirit. The Journey To Wild Divine - The Passage is an ""Inner-active"" computer journey that integrates the power of the spiritual quest with an innovative biofeedback interface and high-end multi-media production. It incorporates mythology and elements of the classic hero and heroine's journey with state of the art 3D graphics, video and music.

In developing The Journey, Bell and Smith have collaborated with various leaders in the field of consciousness and compassionate action on both the spiritual and biofeedback technology aspects of the project. Known as ""allies,"" they include Jean Houston, a pioneer researcher in human capacities, and Nawang Khechog, a former Buddhist monk and one of Tibet's foremost world music composers and musicians.

Bio-feedback is the science of recording both Skin Conductance Levels (SCL) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV), and using this information to modify thoughts, emotions, and breathing. SCL is the measurement of sweat gland activity on a person's skin, and HRV is the calculation of the differences in heart rate from one heartbeat to the next. No two of these intervals are exactly the same, and you need a device more sophisticated than just taking your pulse to determine it. Those who exhibit greater HRV tend to live longer and enjoy life more. When playing this amazing adventure, you slip 3 fingers in the comfortable sensors known as ""Magic Rings"". Your SCL and HRV are interpted by the ""Light Stone"" energy translator.

Up until now, biofeedback technology was in the hands of experts--where a professional had to interpret your results. From those results, you would then learn how to regulate breathing, thoughts, emotional states, and so on. However, with The Journey, the game itself lets you know how you're doing.

Set in the magical Sun Realm, players encounter breathtaking scenery, helpful mentors, and various ""Events"". For example, you're invited to join Cosmo and Sophia in the Inner Imagery Theater--which includes inviting your own partner to share the Magic Rings. Cosmo and Sophia show you how to challenge one other with sensory imaginings, and then you and a partner explore images from the five senses.

For example, my husband and I entered the Inner Imagery Theater together where we challenged each other with images such as ""I want you to imagine stroking the soft fur of a kitten"" or ""I want you to imagine the sound of a gentle rain falling on a tin roof."" All of the other Events I've experienced thus far, however, have been for just one person. (But I'm nowhere near completing the adventure!)

In one of my journeys, I entered a lush courtyard with vibrant greenery, colorful flowers, and majestic colums. I was encouraged to relax and levitate a purple ball. Sound easy? Not necessarily! It depends on how able you are to enter into relaxing breath and peacefulness. There are times when I can float the ball off the screen, but yesterday, I couldn't get it past an inch or so. I was irritated by my son's interruptions (which sent the ball back to the ground!), but it occurred to me that this was a perfect scenario to increase awareness of my thoughts, breathing, and emotional response. After I played the game for about an hour, I was amazed at the marked difference in my mental and emotional states.

However, not all ""Events"" are designed to promote calm. With some, you have to think joyful, enthusiastic thoughts and increase the rate of your breathing--such as spinning a pinwheel.

Helpful mentors you'll encounter include The Royal Falconer, Kwan-Yin--Lady of Compassion, Mila-Rugom, and Luna the White Wolf. You'll receive a magic bag created by the Lady Of The Woods, where you'll be able to store items that you collect on your journey--and use for other Events. For example, you'll need to pick a red rose from the courtyard to give as an offering to the Durga. You can save several areas to the bookmark section, in case you want to go back. Sophia guides you when you first start a game, but when you load it another time, you can bypass this introduction and just head right into the gameplay.

The Journey to the Wild Divine - The Passage comes in an attractive, sturdy box which includes:

*CD-Rom Software featuring spectacular high-definition 3-D graphics and video

*More than 40 unique energy and breathing ""Events""

*Install disks for both PC and Macintosh

*Easy-to-use ""Magic Ring"" biofeedback sensors

*""Light Stone"" energy translator

*Supports upcoming multi-user, online experiences

*Original Soul Flight music CD

*Companion Guide and User's Manual

The music that accompanies the game is filled with gorgeous orchestration from the Soul Flight CD, performed by The Wild Divine Band. Featuring Kurt Smith and Andy McEwen, the band's music (which is sold separately, as well) is intended to have Transformational Effects that can help facilitate the journey of the soul.

The Journey to Wild Divine is a groundbreaking tool for stress-relief, mindfulness, and meditation--promoting a sense of well-being and health. I highly recommend this visionary gift to humanity.

1828,328,1965,"Having tried a number of different wireless network adapters that connect to the computer via the USB port I have found that this type of device is much better.  It is more reliable; and faster to give you a connection when logging into Windows. This adapter frees you from problems with sleep mode, screen savers, etc. that USB type adapters may have.  If you use Linux, Mac OS, etc. this device is a nice solution as well.  The installation program is slightly buggy, but I was able to get the device configured and it has worked flawlessly ever since.  If you have a device that has an RJ-45 Ethernet port and you want to connect it to an A, B or G wireless network this is the best way that I have found.  Internal cards that plug into the PCI or PCI express ports are also reliable and might be better for online gaming.  But I occasionally like to be able to move my adapter to other devices that have RJ-45 Ethernet ports like Game Consols, other computers, etc.  Many other companies make similar adapters that only use the B & G type networks.  This is the only device that I could find that can use type A networks that I use.  You can only connect to one router or access point at a time.  The only gripe that I have is lack of some encryption protocols.  I live in a rural area so encryption isn't too important to me.  The encryption types that this device support are dated and insufficient for important business use in a location that would be prone to wireless snooping.",software
1829,329,990,"I've read all of the glowing reviews of Toast Titanium 7 - ""makes music DVDs, multi-DVD spanning backups, cures cancer, raises the dead, etc.""  And having used previous versions of Toast, I thought I'd spring for the upgrade. Big mistake.

Although I've been using computers for 20 years now (mostly Macs), I've had nothing but problems with this new version of Toast. I haven't had a single successful burn yet, on any kind of media, recording any kind of format.  I thought updating to the latest version might be helpful, but Roxio won't let you download it unless you're a registered user on their website.

Understandable - but I AM a registered user, and their system wouldn't recognize me. So I tried to open a new account, and it wouldn't let me. Okay, I clicked their ""forgot my password"" button, and they say they'll send me a link via email. I've played that little game for about 3 days now, and never a message/link from Roxio.

Trying to solve my tech problems online hasn't helped; Toast keeps giving me error codes which aren't defined anywhere on Roxio's help pages.

Maybe, some bright and glorious day, I'll actually get the program to work and it will merit more than 1 star. But my old version (5.2.3) worked fine, and I dropped a lot of money for a few glittery features...and instead lost all the previous functionality and raised my blood pressure in the bargain. Shame on you, Roxio!

UPDATE:  Okay, three hair-pulling days later I STILL haven't had a successful burn. It's amazing what new ""features"" Roxio has added this time around. For instance, Toast will tell you that you have more than enough room on your disk for the burn, then grind away for an hour or so, then pop up a message saying ""Ooh, sorry, there's not enough space after all.""  Or it's fun to ask it to burn a VCD - at which point it suddenly can't find my disc burner anymore (funny, it was there a moment ago).  Want to compress a long movie the way you can in Popcorn? Well, there's probably a way - but [CENSORED] if I can find it by steering through Toast's incredibly unintuitive interface.

And, oh yes, Roxio's website still won't admit that I'm a customer. If you log on with a new email address and password (as a new user), you'll be able to download the latest update. And you'd better do it during that session, because next time you try to log on, Roxio will have no recollection of your sign-in information (well nearly none - they recognize your email address, but deny your password so you CAN'T log in. Ask them to send you a password reminder, and nothing ever ever ever comes.)

I've used Toast for years, and thought it was a great program. I'm NOT an idiot - honest. But Toast Titanium 7 has so far been a complete and frustrating waste of my money. ZERO STARS!!!!!!!!!!!  (Roxio - I loathe you!)

UPDATE #2 - After a month of trying, I've finally been able to burn a single disk! Wow! Of course, I could have done this with iDVD, any earlier version of Toast, or simply the Mac's OS...but where would the challenge (or expense) be in that? Currently I'm trying to make one of the much-touted ""Music DVD"" disks - but for some reason, even though all of my music files are ALREADY compressed to the MP3 specs that Roxio wants, it's re-encoding every freakin' song. On a G4 Mac with dual processors, it seems like it will take about 8 hours to create a single disk. And really, all Toast is doing is adding a menu structure to an MP3 disk that should have taken about 10 minutes to burn. To quote Monty Python: ""RUN AWAY!! RUN AWAY!!""",software
1830,330,1734,"I was really nervous about buying this, based on the many negative reviews here about installation problems.  After comparing all the different products out there, I decided to go ahead and risk it, because for whatever reason, I never seem to have the installation problems that so many users have with so many different programs.

I'm happy to report that after running the Nero uninstall utility for Nero 7 (available on Nero's website), and then installing Nero 8, all systems are go, and the program is working well for me.

I had Nero 7 as a trial version, which came with a new external DVD-RW drive that I bought.  I have to agree with those who have written that if you have a functioning copy of Nero 7, and aren't looking to work with HD video, upgrading to Nero 8 is probably not worth it.  I use Nero Vision the most, and it is almost exactly the same as the prior version, if anything, a bit more difficult to use.

I give this 4 stars because it's not perfect, but it's very easy to use, the menu navigation is easy, and the wide variety of options, from making backup DVDs to burning audio cd's, to editing video, is quite satisfying.  I also love the fact that I can burn DVDs in either PAL or NTSC formats, which means I can make videos and slideshows for the relatives in both the U.S. and Italy.  I've made two sets of grandparents very happy so far with the slideshows I've put together using this.

I'm also running a PC with 750 or so MB of RAM, and a processor dating back to November 2002, and it works fine, if a bit slow.

1841,341,3731,"Finally, close to a year later, the QB team has fixed the online banking feature.  They did this by allowing users to use the online banking feature the way it used to be before they 'fixed' it last year.  This was a classic ""New Coke"", ""Old Coke"" marketing debacle (for those that remember that ""Edsel"".  For those that were used to the old way, its back.  You simply set it up to work as it did with a simple change in Preferences / Checkbook.

For those new to QB or online banking, you have a choice.  I've used both the ""old"" and the ""new"" process extensively and recommend the ""old"" process.  Its faster and more intuitive.

NOT USING ONLINE BANKING WITHIN QUICKBOOKS?  I think all organizations (profit or not for profit)have income (sales, donations) and expenses.  These typically go through a checking account, savings account and credit card.  If you aren't using online banking then the process is manual to get these transactions into QB.  It saves a great deal of time and reduces errors.  Food for thought.

INTUIT - THEY DON'T TALK WITH EACH OTHER.  I've used Quicken and Quickbooks since January 1994.  I'm also a heavy user of the feature sets.  In other words, I use all or most of the most complex features that are available.  Having said that, it is very apparent to me that Intuit does a poor job of cross fertilization of features between the two products.  The two product teams (QB and Quicken) apparently don't talk.  Not invented here seems to be in place.  I will share only one example, but there are many.  In Quicken, there is a feature to attach a note to a transaction so you can remember details about it.  You can also scan and attach an invoice, receipt or deposit slip to a transaction.  There are a number of useful features in Quicken that are not avaiable in QB.

1842,342,881,"The reviews for Money 2005 are very good -- I suggest reading them all to see what you're in for.

The big problems for me were:

1) The ability to have separate category and subcategory lists was removed from the transaction form

2) I couldn't easily use the 'Transfer' category, especially in a split category

3) Annoying duplicate account creation

On the first problem, Money 2005 uses just one combined category-subcategory list, so when you enter a transaction, you must choose a category-subcategory from one big list.  I prefer two distinct selections because it's quicker to enter and easier to find my subcategories.  Microsoft provides a Registery edit in the following Knowledgebase article:

[...]

I used the edit, and my separate lists are restored.  Great, but I am irritated that Money 2005 removed this option and provided no way for a user to change this behavior short of a Registery hack.

On the 2nd problem, my ability to 'Transfer' amounts to different account was resolved once I split my subcategory lists from my category lists using the above Registery hack.  Now, transfers operate as they did in Money 2003, which is the last version I was using.

On the 3rd problem, one financial institution has, for the 2nd time, downloaded duplicate accounts.  I hope it's an anomoly, but we'll see.  Other accounts operate fine.

I haven't explored the strengths of 2005 yet -- this was just post-upgrade issues I've wrestled with over the New Year's weekend.  On the surface, doesn't look like much new is useful to me.

On the matter of online bill payment, I already had that through Wachovia bank (formerly First Union).  I guess what's new is that Microsoft now makes bill payment through Money work with many institutions.  Since Wachovia already provided this function, I don't think I'm adversely affected...or benefitted (though Wachovia dropped the $6 monthly fee for using Money's bill payment function).

One final piece of advice:  after you install, don't open your Money data file unless/until you have had Money perform all its software updates.  For me, I opened my Money 2003 file, was prompted to convert to Money 2005 file format, and then Money 2005 automatically downloaded software patches afterwards.  Wondering whether my conversion worked right nor not, I chose to open a backup of my Money 2003 data file using the patched copy of Money 2005, so any software bug fixes related to data conversion were already installed in Money 2005.

1845,345,911,"This is my 12th review and completed adventure in the Nancy Drew series.

First, I'd like to start by dividing my review into two factions.
1) The game itself
2) My personal detective work.

* PART 1 *

PLOT: Nancy is asked to involve herself in her first International mystery! This lady detective heads on over to a 14th century English manor  reputed to hold a startling family history of intrigue, chaos, and scandal! Also, in recent events, a full-fledged curse involving a dangerous beast marauding the moors!  But to get down to business, she seeks why her neighbors' daughter is suffering from a strange case of [lycanthropy?}

INITIAL SCORE: 93

CHARACTERS:

Linda Penvellyn : I love a mysterious woman, but this is ridiculous! I really don't get the anger issues now that the plot reveal indicates the TRUE source of her ailments.  Was this just a woman who cannot handle stress or does she have other deep-seeded issues?
I still have no idea what she looks like and I am not buying the game cover art because she was not involved in any real part of the storyline.

Jane Penvellyn : I really loved playing those games with her and I spanked her more times than not.  I sensed a little attitude with her at the end. I didn't know how to take that...

Mrs. Drake: I thought I would see more of her than I did especially since she was a main presence in the day-to-day events of the manor.  Then again, I never really enjoyed talking to her so I guess it was for the best.

Nigel Mookerjee:  A writer that was hired by Mrs. Drake to finally throw an encompassing tell-all [in a positive light] book revealing the exploits of the Penvellyn name.  I thought he was okay in general, but the typing test he had me perform was idiotic.

Ethel Bosinny: I really wanted to learn more about her and the fact that she startled me a couple time was really laughable. I probably never jumped in a ND game before, but they GOT me! :)  I wanted to learn more about what rituals/customs she was intent on passing down through the family lineage with Jane.

Ned Nickerson : Supportive as always.

Loulou: A parrot that really DID get on your nerves after awhile. The voice was poorly-acted [sounding like a human mimicking a parrot] by whatever actor was in charge of that performance.  Also, if you were going to add catch-phrases, try adding at least TEN more. ""We are going to need a bigger boat."" only goes so far after the 12th time heard.

CUMUL SCORE: - 4 = 89

SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:
One of the best scores I have heard in a ND game to date! Very enticing and it got you into the spirit of the adventure. Graphics, although not top-notch as the others, had designers working 24/7 because the immensity of what they had to  accomplish. So many areas of the manor were majestically done!

CUMUL SCORE: + 4 = 93

PUZZLES/MINI-GAMES:  I agree with past reviewers that there was a certain level of puzzle-solving that made it too hard for the casual gamer.  Mindlessly strutting around looking for leads would have added an extra five hours to my gameplay NEEDLESSLY, if I didn't short-cut with a walkthrough [didn't cheat the actual puzzles mind you]. I think they were too difficult for their own good and am trying very hard to remember if I actually enjoyed any of them.  The only thing that comes to mind is Skull & Bones and how Jane would ask "" Do you have any SPY-dehs??"" in her english accent. :) Go Dig!

CUMUL SCORE: + 1 = 94

ADVENTURE ENDING: Now I don't mind not getting the culprit right, but when the set-up doesn't equal the payoff, I can get pretty upset. Why was I bothered to learn about this family in a historical sense? Okay, I forgive that, but here is what is NOT forgivable....absolutely no character  resolutions for the player.
1) What was that wolf thing in the bushes? Was it real? If not, explain how it was faked! Same poor excuse like in SAWE
2) Could Linda's ailments actually happen according to the explanation? No!
3) What became of Linda except ""the family [Hugh/Linda/Jane] learned to grow together"". I want instant reactions to what happened immediately when the culprit was revealed...not a flimsy gloss-over going forward.
4) No TRUE culprit punishment after all I invested? [13 game hours]
5) What happened to all the side characters and their finality?

CUMUL SCORE: - 10 = 84

* PART 2 *

I try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to
take weeks! Well, it took me four days  and I gave myself a
Detective Score Of : 56

My Strong Points: I battled to stay interested to the history of the family and even  memorized their family tree! [Where did that ultimately get me? 97% useless knowledge]  I solved the difficult games, but lets face it,  I am not spending four hours monkeying around with moving walls again and again. Why did I have to CONSTANTLY maneuver the gargoyle & dragon to enter the West & East secret rooms? Couldn't the developers put it as RESOLVED instead of the tediousness of doing the steps ten times throughout the game? I punished myself nonetheless, but especially because I had the culprit all wrong.

My Weak Points: General frustration with the game interface and it clouded my judgements on the linear tasks ahead.

OVERALL GAME SCORE: 84 + 56/ 2 = 70 [ C - ]

BOTTOMLINE: I'll not begrudge HER on how they wanted to resolve the main plotline, but for God Sakes clean up the ending so the Nancy Drew fans have some resolution on the other fifteen things that were occuring. We have invested countless hours and I learned nothing of how certain tricks were done and why. Should I just accept ""Because the culprit enjoyed lying""?

1861,361,402,"Honestly, I think you should wait a year or two before you upgrade most of the new features are not really relevant to consumers, but are aimed more at businesses. I don't know if they are shipping Office XP with Service release 1, but I think most users who would like to uprgade should at least wait until it is being shipped with the bug fixes. The applications look beautiful. They are easy to use of course, but if you are just typing documents, sending e-mail, adding numbers things like that stick with Office 2000. Because in these rough times you don't want to waste money on something you are actually getting over and over and over again. I'm not saying it's the same applications but for users who are doing simple things in Office it really does not make sense to buy something that is packed up with 90% of features you are not using. Just have a little patience and wait the year or two by that time Microsoft will be releasing Office XP 2005, and trust me they are, I read in an interview, where the Microsoft Office Team manager said the next version of Office XP will be based more on collaboration and services. I am making sure you don't make any regrets, buying this product.",software
1862,362,5270,"Microsoft Office 2007 was a radical departure from the previous versions of Office:  it introduced an XML-based file format that changed files like "".doc"" and "".xls""  to "".docx"" and "".xlsx"".  More importantly, it heavily modified the user interface, changing the old way of menus to the new ""Ribbon Control"" with tabs and context-sensitive icons.

This is the Professional version of Office:  it contains Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Access and Publisher.  The Home & Business Edition subtracts Publisher and Access and the Home Edition further subtracts Outlook.

Dude, Where's my Stuff?
While Office 2010 isn't as radical a departure as 2007 was, it is definitely different.  Users who have just gotten used to the Ribbon Control may be exasperated to find that once again features have been moved.  Gone is the circular ""Office"" button that used to be your access point for things like saving and printing--the ""File"" menu is back...but not quite.  The User Interface has been tweaked to provide more visible work surface, and yet there are now tabs in the ribbon that completely hide the work surface.  For example, the ""File"" menu will open a web-page-style layout that covers the entire window:  it offers basic menu items on the left, some large-button categorical options in the middle, and then refreshes the huge space on the right with large buttons for the basic features.  Instead of menus and sub-menus it is now more like navigating a web site.
Then there's the verbiage.  For example, ""Send...as e-mail attachment"" is now performed by choosing ""Save & Send"" on the left, then ""Send Using E-mail"" in the middle, and ""Send as Attachment"" on the right.
After a little bit of time looking at the Office 2010 Ribbon and Menus, you'll start to understand exactly what's been done to Office this time around.  Microsoft have added a huge ton of features, and then tried to put all of those as close to the navigation surface as possible.  In other words, you'll no longer be clicking *deep* into the menus, you'll be making one or two clicks and then looking at all the options that are dumped on your screen to pick which one you'll be using.  To make matters more confusing, some options (such as ""Save"" or ""Open"") drop you off the File Menu, give you the typical Open/Save dialog box you are used to, and then automatically select the ""Insert"" tab and show you the work surface before you finish making your selection.  It can get very distracting.

Return of the Feature Creep
In the past whenever Office bolted on new items (such as blogging), the typical way of dealing with it was to give you toolbars that you could show, hide, and drag around to arrange at the top of your screen.  Now what we have is:
- Tab names at the top that come and go based on what you're doing (like Office 2007)
- Changes to the workspace based on which tab you've selected
- A File Menu that is no longer a candy-like button but is another tab on the ribbon...and yet it drops every possible option onto the screen and trusts you to navigate through them.

Tuned and Tweaked
That said, Microsoft have done something under the covers that has been a blessing and a curse.  On the one hand, your programs will load lightning-quick.  On the other, if you try to keep two installations of Office on the same machine, what is supposed to work will instead work unevenly:  Word and Excel will let you open both versions, but my installations of Outlook and Project completely blocked my ability to launch the 2007 versions (despite repeatedly indicating otherwise during installation and configuration).

Future Forecast:  Bright, but Cloudy
The other feature Office 2010 places more at the forefront is the idea of The Cloud.  In Office-Speak, this means using the Internet to keep documents synced in real-time no matter where you go.  If you remember Windows Briefcase, this is everything the Briefcase should have been.  If you ever tried the File Sync Wizard, Windows Sharing and Synchronization, or ActiveSync, this is like an invisible, hands-free version of that.  There's good and bad about this and you want to be aware of what it entails before you get involved.  For example, you can create a new file and choose ""Store on Web"" or ""Save to Web"".  When you do this, you will be prompted to choose the location.  If that location is a Windows Live account, then you'll want to pay attention to whether you are saving to a private folder or a public one.  From that point forward, any time you open the document on any machine it can fetch the latest version from the web.  If you don't want your document to sync automatically it can also be done manually.

If you're used to Microsoft Office 2007, you will be impressed with Office 2010's addition of features and its performance as a program.  Expect to be frustrated from time to time when something appears to have `moved'.  If you're new to the revised Office system of 2007 and 2010, it is a complete look-and-feel overhaul and you will want to spend some time getting to know it.",software

It guides you through exercises very well, it asks you after each segment if you want to practice more or if you want to go forward.  There are quizzes to check your progress that give you your typing speed and accuracy rate.
The program looks very old fashioned. The lessons are voiced by a real person, but they dictate your exercises using Windows Anna voice - very metallic robotic voice with some sounds that are hard to understand, real people just do not talk like that. You can highlight and have the Anna voice dictate you any text they present in the program, but she reads fast with no regard of how fast/accurate you are typing. I almost never use the feature except where I am forced to.
Another negative thing I experienced when I logged in for the second time. I forgot where to click and clicked on the assessment button instead of on a lesson button. The program proceeded with assessment, I could not exit out of it, and all my yesterday's lessons were erased, I had to start over again. At this point I went to the options menus and enabled taking skill checks and next lessons without having to finish previous ones. I do not understand why they put the assess/erase your work button so prominently on the page.
There is Typing forum feature, where you can either type a text they have, or you type whatever you want to type, and they tell you your speed. It is useful for later time when you are more skilled. YOu can print reports on when and what you did in the program and your speed/accuracy rates.

My problem with Norton is that it makes everything else run very slowly.  Outlook, in particular, takes forever to open and programs frequently hang.  I have an older PC desktop running Windows 7, but it handles most software without noticeable delay -- or at least, it used to.

Norton also lets a surprising number of pop-ups get through, which Trend never did.  I never realized how many of these Trend actually caught, until it was gone.

1875,375,4673,"WordPerect X5 is an office suite consisting of WordPerfect X5 (Word Processor), Quattro Pro X5 (Spreadsheet), Presentations X5 (Mutimedia Presentation), and WordPerfect Lightning  (Digital Notebook).

This review will highlight some of the features of the WordPerfect Office Suite.

WordPerfect
-----------
- QuickCorrect
QuickCorrect (called AutoCorrect in Word) is a pretty standard feature in word processors nowadays but a feature unique to WordPerfect is SpeedLinks. SpeedLinks allows you to specify a ""Link Word"" (e.g. @Amazon) and a corresponding Web address to link to (e.g. Amazon's Web address). Every time you type in @Amazon, the ""@Amazon"" will be replaced with Amazon's Web address.

- Multiple File Formats Supported
You can convert a WordPerfect file into Microsoft Word and other word processor formats such as WordStar, XyWrite, and DisplayWrite. If your document contains tables, you have to the option of converting the document into MS Excel, OfficeWriter, QuattroPro, and Lotus 123 as well.

- Frustration-Free
I used Word for many years before I gave up on it almost entirely. I usually elect instead to create my documents in a plain text editor like Editplus, copy and paste it in Word, and ten add on the finishing touches, such as underlining, italics, and bold (which a plain text editor cannot do). The reason: formatting quirks (e.g. line spacing, indentation) in Microsoft Word can be absolutely exasperating! If you use Word on a regular basis, *you know* what I'm talking about.

Word processing not only works flawlessly in WordPerfect, it is incredibly easy to incorporate, format, and manipulate tables, pictures, and multimedia. I can concentrate on creating content without having to contend with software quirks.

Quattro Pro
-----------
Quattro Pro is a full-feature spreadsheet program like Excel. However, There is a disadvantage of using Quattro Pro. Since the vast majority of people use Excel rather than Quattro Pro or any other spreadsheet programs, help resources are not as abundant as Excel. This will almost definitely not be an issue if you're using Quattro Pro for designing simple spreadsheet but it may be a concern if you're planning on designing more complex spreadsheets that involve more advanced features such as macros.

Quattro Pro is also incompatible with Excel. You cannot expect to easily migrate an Excel file in Quattro Pro and vice versa. If you're newbie on spreadsheet, my advice: go with Excel.

Presentations X5
----------------
Presentations X5 works a lot like Microsoft Powerpoint. You can easily create presentation slide shows. Presentations X5 allows you to insert pictures, sounds, spreadsheets, multimedia files (such as MPEG, AVI), and other objects.

Extras
------
- Create PDF's
New in X5 is a PDF Tool which allows you to turn any WordPerfect document into a PDF file. It can even convert image-based PDF files into editable content! Use it to add comments or mark up your PDF files. PDF files can be password-protected.

You can create high-resolution or low-resolution PDF's (high-resolution PDF's are best suited for printing and low-resolution PDF's are best suited for posting on the Web.) Note: PDF Tool is only available in the Standard and Professional versions of the WordPerfect Suite.

---
WordPerfect Office X5's forte is in its word processing program, WordPerfect. (Any wonder why Corel named its office suite after its word processing program?) I am very impressed by how easy it is to create and edit content in WordPerfect. Presentations X5 is a superb program as well. As for Quattro Pro, I do have slight reservations about recommending it to someone who uses its more advanced features, not because of any flaws inherent in the program, but because help resources are relatively scanty compared to Excel. All in all, I'm thoroughly impressed with the WordPerfect Office suite. The bottom line: if you need a word processing program and have only rudimentary spreadsheet needs, the WordPerfect Office X5 suite is definitely the way to go.",software

As far as I know, the latest (and probably last) version of Roxio Easy CD & DVD was Version 14.0.49.2.  The version number is absent from product pages as to what version is now available which is very misleading.  Even the Roxio forums are no help.

I've used Version 14 on Windows 7 and 8.1, the latter I'm still using.  I tried Windows 10, but promptly got rid of it when some of my programs would not run so I don't know if it worked in that version of Windows.

I only use Roxio for backing up files even though it also has other programs for making music and video discs.  For me it is enough.  The only problem I have had is that there's a file in Roxio that interferes with a file in my Legacy Family Tree software so I get a prompt to install Roxio.  This might be an incompatibility issue with Roxio because I don't have that problem with other software however it still performs backups without any issues.

I needed what they offer, though, so I ordered a pair and braced myself for a terrible experience.

I have to say that the ""2 Minute Installation"" note on the front of the package turned out to be a significant understatement.  It took me at least five minutes to get the adapters cabled, plugged into wall outlets, and synced.  I did exactly what the instructions said to do - six easy steps - and everything worked perfectly.  I didn't have to touch any of our network settings.

1879,379,9521,"Don't buy ""Ultimate"".  I thought that ""Face Filter"" would be a nice bonus with the ultimate version.  I'm very disappointed with FaceFilter.  First of all it is a separate program, it is NOT integrated with PaintShop Pro.  FaceFilter is also the ""standard"" version not the ""pro"" version and thus you'll be frustrated and wanting the more expensive pro version.  The standard version lacks a *lot* of the overall features and basically is *only* for tweaking faces (and they should be more or less straight on angles) and is limited to 1920x1920 resolution (pro version can handle up to 6000x6000 pixel images).

PaintShop Pro X7 itself is a very well designed and capable photo editing program.  The only serious flaw I don't like is that often when I switch from ""manage"" to ""Adjust"" to ""Edit"" modes I end up losing my edits because it has switched me back to the original photo rather than the one I was editing in another mode!

1881,381,914,"""Curse of Blackmoor Manor"" is probably one of the most revolutionary games in the Nancy Drew series. First of all, this is the first Nancy Drew game to take place somewhere outside of the continental United States, which deserves recognition in and of itself (yes - Nancy's FINALLY going out of the country to solve a case!). Secondly, Nancy's suspect list has always before been equally populated by men and women, or has had two or three men to one woman. For the first time, Nancy has a case with mostly female suspects (three females and one male). I found this very interesting, and nicely thought through. Thirdly, this is one of the most challenging and frightening Nancy Drew titles, and was advertised as the most so when it was released.

Not only is the game revolutionary, but it's also awesome. The storyline is very intense, and the history surrounding Blackmoor Manor is so richly detailed. It's amazing to see how much thought must've gone into this game, and I imagine it took more effort from the creators than ever before.

A young woman named Linda has recently married Hugh Penvellyn, a wealthy British diplomat, and has gone over to start a new life with him and his stepdaughter in England. They live together in Blackmoor Manor, where the Penvellyns have lived for hundreds of years. However, shortly after she moves in, Linda begins to feel sickly and starts behaving bizarrely. She throws fits, hides behind a bed curtain all day, and refuses to eat healthy food. Nobody knows what's caused this change in her, and in a fit of desperation, her mom (who still lives in America) calls Nancy to ask her if she could fly out to England to find out what's happening to Linda.

Once she arrives in Blackmoor Manor, Nancy hears a sinister-sounding creature call out her name. When she looks around, she sees a pair of glowing eyes staring at her. Mrs. Drake, an elderly woman who's been taking care of the manor, answers the door, but not before the creature leaves. Mrs. Drake seems skeptical of what Nancy claims to have seen, but that doesn't stop Nancy from investigating. She soon discovers that one of the Penvellyns to own Blackmoor Manor was burned at the stake for witchcraft hundreds of years ago, and a beast she's rumored to have created had been prowling the moors for years. Could this beast have now returned? And why? And what (if anything) does it have to do with Linda? The answers to all these questions and more can only be found by solving this case...

This is probably one of the most unique plots in the Nancy Drew series.  This is the first time when she's not called in to investigate high-profile crimes, like murder, threats, vandalism, kidnapping, theft, and the like. ""Curse of Blackmoor Manor"" is also the first game to feature a family struggle that's turned into a mystery that Nancy is now called to solve. I enjoyed this plot quite a bit, and felt it was quite refreshing.

Blackmoor Manor is beautifully detailed. The graphics used in this game are superb, and even though it was released way back in 2005, the gaming quality and graphics still rival many games today. I really can't complain about the graphics, save for the fact that Jane's appearance might seem a tiny bit disproportional (but she's also young, short, and sitting down on a bed, which is hard to animate).

This game featured A LOT of puzzles, but they were all very well-explained and served a purpose for being there. I liked them all, and even though others might complain, I personally cannot. I also liked exploring the manor, which is rather large and has many places and things to see. My sole complaint is that at least half of the exploration takes place in the secret passageways, and I would've liked to see more of the ""outer surface"" of Blackmoor Manor.

There were also lots of fun mini games to play, so the player can find something else fun to do in the game if they're bored with solving puzzles and want to take a break from the mystery. The character Jane has several games that Nancy can play with her. All of them have to be played at least once to progress the game in some way, but they can all be played again as much as the player wants to (Jane's always up for play!).

All of the characters were very well-developed, and all had reason for being at the manor while Nancy was staying there. They also all had something to benefit by causing the haunting and horror surrounding Blackmoor Manor, and for terrorizing poor Linda. The first suspect met is Mrs. Drake, Hugh's aunt with a self-righteous attitude and believes the British to be superior to the Americans in every way. Nigel Mookerjee is a historian who's been hired by Mrs. Drake to write a book on the Penvellyns, and is looking for something in the family history to ""spice things up"" for his book. Jane Penvellyn is Hugh's 12-year-old daughter who's been forced to return to the manor after living in the United States for awhile, and seems to miss her biological mother very much. Ethel Bosinny is Jane's private tutor who only appears every so often, and is very elusive and mysterious in the sense that she never seems to be found in the same place twice (nor can when she'll appear be predicted).

The other characters and phone friends are all pretty nicely integrated too. I absolutely loved the fact that Nancy can call Ned again (as he hadn't appeared in a game since ""The Final Scene""), and the new method of getting hints that this game employed was very unique and fun. Rather than getting her hints from her phone friends, Nancy consults with Loulou, an 80-year-old female parrot who's residing in the manor. Loulou is very smart, and has quite a lot of funny comments to make about the case and everything involved. She's very well-scripted, and I loved talking to her because of how much comedic relief she added to the game.

All and all, the characters were great. I honestly didn't know who the culprit would be for sure until the end, but I did have my greatest suspicion leaning toward one particular person. This hunch was correct, but I was glad about that, as it employed two moves that needed to be done in culprit selection (one that'd never been done before, and one that was rarely done before). I won't say anything further, as I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't played...

""Curse of Blackmoor Manor"" had a great musical score. I liked the traditional British feel of the music, and it definitely suited the location of the mystery. Every now and then, it also got more eerie, which also added to the overall fright factor.

After being voted into the top three overall games, ""Curse of Blackmoor Manor"" was released in the Collector's Edition Fan Favorites pack with ""Treasure in the Royal Tower"" and ""The Secret of Shadow Ranch"". Did it earn its spot there? For sure! This game brought a true revolution to the Nancy Drew games, and remains one of the best even to this date. I've been playing this game for years, and I still jump a bit whenever I see phantoms and monsters creeping about the manor, watch clips of nightmares that Nancy has, or Ethel pops up in the middle of the night. It's a fun fright that's perfect for those who're willing to face their fears and solve one of the most terrifying cases that adventure gaming has ever known!",software
1882,382,1933,"Power and layout are the two big advantages to this USB hub.  This hub has the power to drive not only the full USB 2.0 rated current capacities, but beyond.  It means that, for example, one of its USB ports can power up a Western Digital Passport external USB hard disk drive which is very unusual for a hub.  Since the idea of buying a USB hub is to move functions away from your limited number of computer USB ports (especially a notebook computer!), the more of those functions it can move, the better.  And this device will let you plug that Passport in where it is out of your way.  The device is well laid out, too.  The power, input USB port, and three of the seven USB output ports are on the back end of the device (above where it says ""T7Hub"" in the photograph) which makes cable routing easier for ""permanent"" devices like printers, scanners, etc., since the cables for those come from behind it (and don't clutter the front).

1889,389,3190,"Whilst trivial, the one item I liked the most on this issue of ULEAD is the  capture capability from DVDs through windvd 8. This output file was generally a bmp, and MEDIAONE editor allowed a file to be converted to a smaller file with the same quality.
The Central testing area I used is the capture area, since it has the most widespread use in media. There are 7 tools in the Capture Video Tool, and I took a music track and inserted this audio track first. Then I placed a selection of Pictures and movie files from Various sources (such as Windvd 8's capture feature, and the sample media I can gather from other DVDs) and defined the time sequences for each photo or media( The ability to  extend the picture duration out, as well as the video works well in this medium).And after the projext is complete, you can output the project to a pure digital file, or to a DVD using the system. ULEAD can capture from any digital source, and output to any digital source. About the only additional thing I would use is the free application ""Quick Media Converter"" which makes various media files available to ULEAD, as well as from ULEAD.
ULEAD makes the basis for an excellent digital editing system , and in this package the bonus of windvd 8 Silver makes for the best viewer of digital output... the audio quality alone makes the whole thing totally worthwhile, and wether you use it with Bought DVDs or DVDs you mixed down yourself, the audio quality is superb.",software

It is more reliable; and faster to give you a connection when logging into Windows. This adapter frees you from problems with sleep mode, screen savers, etc. that USB type adapters may have.  If you use Linux, Mac OS, etc. this device is a nice solution as well.  The installation program is slightly buggy, but I was able to get the device configured and it has worked flawlessly ever since.  If you have a device that has an RJ-45 Ethernet port and you want to connect it to an A, B or G wireless network this is the best way that I have found.  Internal cards that plug into the PCI or PCI express ports are also reliable and might be better for online gaming.  But I occasionally like to be able to move my adapter to other devices that have RJ-45 Ethernet ports like Game Consols, other computers, etc.  Many other companies make similar adapters that only use the B & G type networks.  This is the only device that I could find that can use type A networks that I use.  You can only connect to one router or access point at a time.  The only gripe that I have is lack of some encryption protocols.  I live in a rural area so encryption isn't too important to me.

1891,391,4170,"I have done a decent amount of printing at home using various software over the years.  Everything from banners, cards, and even cd-covers and labels.  Every type of project required me to use a specific program so I thought that Print Master would solve the confusion of having all these different programs on my computer.  Unfortunately the Print Master software has too many of its own design flaws to be usable.  First of all the installation process was a mess.  I needed to print some invitation cards so I thought I would install the program and get started but to my horror the process was still ongoing at nearly 30 minutes!  Granted my computer is very old but a printing program should not take as long as Microsoft Office to install!

Once installed, I found the program to be a bit hard to navigate and somewhat confusing.  It might be the learning curve that is involved but shouldn't software be designed so that even a new user can come in and start using the program without much fuss?

Compared to the PC version, Dragon Dictate for Mac leaves a lot to be desired. Recognition speed and accuracy are fair compared to the Windows version but still better than IBM ViaVoice.  Where Dragon Dictate 4.0 seriously falls short is with editing and correcting. You might as well be typing everything as there will be enough errors no matter how clearly you speak and how well you annunciate individual words and phrases. When using voice commands to edit and correct, Dragon makes random selections.  It also inserts text at random places after editing (i.e. not at the cursor).  It is unbelievable but true that they have shipped this product repeatedly with the same bugs. As a long-term Nuance customer, I received my copy for $99 together with Password Genie (that I see no use for) directly from Nuance. People planning to pay the full price should be at least twice as reluctant to purchase.  To be fair, I would have paid $20 for something with this level of reliability and functionality.

When I run Dragon 11, it seems to take a second or two before executing any commands.  This can be really frustrating.  When I use the MouseGrid, a command that lets you position your mouse cursor using a grid on the screen, I notice the latency the most.  It sometimes takes several seconds for the grids to appear.

One of the main reasons I use Dragon is for writing screenplays.  I've been able to use this version with FinalDraft 8 with no problems.  I can create commands for my character names, so when I speak the character name it automatically adds the character callout and moves to the dialog line.

1901,401,4818,"I tried this product more out of curiosity than out of a desire to anything in particular with it (I'm not a writer, I'm not continuously typing long documents, and even if I were, my typing is pretty good).  I was fairly impressed at first, just because I've never used speech recognition software before, and it was a delight to see what I was saying (mostly) appearing on screen.

After playing around with it for a while, however, I don't think it would be the kind of software I would want to use regularly to compose documents.  When I'm typing, I watch the screen, and correct nearly all of my errors as they appear.  It's absolute torture for me to go through and proof my work after I've typed it.  Using speech recognition software regularly would force me to do so, since I'm less likely to catch the errors in real time.  Now, proofreading is a good skill to have, and a good habit to be in, but I _hate_ doing it, so anything that would make me have to do so (like a critical boss, or speech recognition software) is something I'm not eager to embrace (I don't actually make a habit of embracing any of my bosses, but that's neither here nor there).

So, if you're lazy like me, you'll be torn between the convenience of keeping your hands in your pockets (or busy ferrying junk food from the bag to your face) while you work, and the inconvenience of proofing your work after it's dictated.  For the diligent, I guess this software would let them dictate documents while doing chin-ups, or something, but that's a lifestyle (diligence, physical fitness) that I don't know much about and can't provide a lot of useful feedback on.",software

1907,407,6843,"I've been using Paint Shop Pro since version 7. When Corel first bought it from it's shareware creators, they began to dumb it down and it really lost a great deal of its following. Fortunately, they left most of the power under the hood and those features that had been dumbed out of the menus, were still accessible for power users.

I've since upgraded to PSPX and PSP 14, so I am very familiar with the program. Lets start with the inevitable comparison to photoshop. Paint Shop Pro can do,  and has been able to do, 95%+ of what Photoshop as been able to do all along... Layers, yep had them forever, curves, yep... Color enhancement, easy one fixes and removing objects, they are all there. White balance correction, yep - in several places actually. It can read raw files from most major camera makers and will save to any format you can imagine. It can remove objects, repair old photos, make new photos look old, add frames, upload to Flickr, facebook, photobucket, etc... It really does it al.

Paint Shop Pro is powerful enough for anyone, even the snide, presumptuous photo editors that would have you believe that if your photo editing package didn't cost $500 then it isn't worth looking at... Pure elitist hogwash.

ANYTHING that you want to do with a photo can be done with this program.

So why isn't it more widely accepted?

Well, the industry likes a standard and photoshop was the standard back when PSP was still a $79 shareware program. So Photoshop became the standard. And once you learn the way a program works, you don't want to have to relearn the way another program works. Often it is as simple as which key combinations you have to press. Once you have mastered one program, you don't want to have to go back and relearn how to accomplish the same thing in another program.

There is one other big difference. Photoshop has always been far ahead of Paint Shop Pro in standardizing what colors you see on a photo no matter what monitor or computer you are using to view the photo. PSP only recently started trying to make this a priority.

For someone sending their work to LIFE magazine, this is important. For someone sending photos to Walgreens.com or making a shutterfly book for family and friends, it is not. All of the photo printers have software that corrects that sort of thing.

In the end it is fairly simple. If you need photoshop, get it. You will KNOW if you NEED it. If you aren't sure, then you don't need Photoshop. If you think you need PhotoShop, you probably DON'T need it. If $500 is chump change to you, then go ahead and get photoshop. If you make a living sending photos to major publications, get photoshop.

On the other hand, if $500 is a lot of money to you, get Paint Shop Pro. It is a super powerful photo editing program that has the power of photoshop under the hood, but with the ease of use that you would expect from a much less powerful program. You truly get the best of both worlds with Paint Shop Pro!

Low price, ease of use and many automated picture fixing options, yet you also have the power of layers, curves and white balancing no so much more if you are willing to learn how to use them. This is truly a bargain priced program that does virtually everything PS does (and some things it does better) at a fraction of the cost.",software

Browsing Symantec website I realized that they added product activation to their 2004 software like Norton Antivirus, System Works, and Internet Security. I'm a legitimate System Works and Internet Security user. Every year in September I upgrade to the new version. This would have been the fourth upgrade since I already own Norton Internet Security and System Works for 2001, 2002, and 2003. This new activation scheme is outrageous!!! I did not use any pirated software and I don't intend to start now but I change my hardware a lot and reinstall applications and I find that by requiring product activation Symantec hits me as a legitimate user since the product allows only 5 activations. In 4 months I will be unable to use it if I reinstall the OS 5 times, and here I am, a legitimate user and a loyal customer who paid Symantec for 4 years unable to use software I paid for.

That said, this Norton Internet Security 2004 goes back to the store and this is the last time I buy Symantec Products.

1910,410,450,"I recently upgraded form Windows 98 to XP on my home PC.  I use Windows 2000 at work and I have to say that XP is by far the best choice for the home PC.  I did the XP Upgrade and I must say that is was extremely easy to convert my 98 system to XP.  I takes A L-O-N-G time to do the install (a single cd, yet prepare to spend about 2 hours once you hit ""go"").
MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER....
If you do nothing else to prepare for the upgrade; take the time to run the hardware & software compatibility check before you commit yourself to the install.  This is most critical & here's a good example.  The driver for my PC's modem/chipset was incompatible with XP.  This was highlighted when I ran the test and it allowed me to retrieve the updated driver before launching the upgrade.  If I had not done this, then I would have been toast.  After the upgrade I would not have been able to use my modem to access the internet to get the new driver after the fact.  So do yourself a favor, run the test, print it out, get all your patches beforehand & you'll save yourself a ton of frustration and wasted time.
Other than that it's great and very easy to load.  They did a great job with the user interface and instructions.  It was a no brainer to install.  Just remeber to read everything first, run the compatibility test, print out the important stuff (it even tells you what the important stuff is!) and get your patches before you hit ""go"".

1911,411,4445,"AVG is best known for their free antivirus though they have offered for years a full security suite. I had never bothered to try AVG Internet Security (AVG IS), mainly because it is an expensive package in comparison to most of the other offerings on the market. That said, it is a solid product and worth consideration in spite of the cost.

I should start by stating, for the record, that I had a dreadful install experience. AVG IS partially installed itself and then errored out. After a reboot, AVG IS was alive but outdated, and what was broken was the ability to update. Worse, the uninstall was also broken. After getting the uninstall ironed out, I tried to install again and this time everything was much smoother.

AVG IS is organized and clean with a very clear and easy-to-understand overview dashboard. At a glance you can tell what is active and what is not active. Double-clicking on any of the icons in this view gives access to adjustment controls by which the component in question can be manipulated and set as desired. I like this particular view. One thing that is not clear, though, is that to get to the real nuts and bolts of the various components' configurations, one must use the pull-down menus, not the icons.

AVG's firewall appears to do a good job of hiding the system on the net, locking down service ports and cutting off ping responses. I was unable to break it. However, where it gets interesting is in the control afforded the user - individual applications can be locked down, policies set for different networks, and so much more. Other firewalls do this, but AVG's organization in the interface is better than average.

AVG's track record as an antivirus vendor is well known. However, with versions prior to 9.0 their antivirus was slow, intrusive and hard to interrupt. AVG seems to have gotten the idea of how to improve this - it took about 90 minutes to scan over 1,000,000 items if you include the registry and even running at full speed I hardly noticed except for the fact that I had the task manager open and saw an occasional spike in CPU activity. I launched several applications, typed a lot, and even searched for a file on the hard drive and saw no real impact on the system. Cycles consumed seemed to be consistently under 10%.

AVG throws a lot of other things into the mix that you'd expect in a decent suite - antispam, antispyware, rootkit detection, and several other components. What surprised me was to find a process viewer that has the ability to kill processes, accessible from the dashboard under system tools. I have never worked with a security suite with that built-in as part of the package. Included is a connectivity viewer and even a startup process viewer, with the ability to manipulate the entries within. That's a very nice plus.

I've been unable to work with the antispam up to this point, as I get no spam. Even so, there are many, many settings that can be adjusted to the antispam, such as adding a blacklist server such as spamcop to assist with checking, Bayesian training and a lot more. Based on the feature set I suspect this antispam is very effective.

AVG IS includes a McAfee-style system of evaluating returns from search engines, marking unsafe links in the results window. It is not as thorough as McAfee's Site Adviser, but it is effective in giving you  heads-up when there is a possible danger ahead.

There are two things that AVG does not have that I wish were present. First, there is no parental control module. It looks like AVG made no effort at all to include a parental controls module, and while that's ok it is something that most other security suites include.  I was unable to even find a manual block list - if it's there, I cannot find it. Second, I found no ability to see the presence of other computers on the network. It is not something that I have found in a lot of suites but it's a very nice-to-have.

AVG has put together a very nice internet security suite. The main components, the antivirus and the firewall, are both very effective and all of the other components seem to be working nicely. There is room for some improvement/expansion, as is true with most security suites, but what is here is very polished and clean. AVG is a little pricey when compared to most other suites, but in spite of that cost it is very much worth consideration when looking at computer security suites. I am comfortable giving AVG IS a 5/5 stars rating - it isn't absolutely perfect, but what is there is excellent.",software

1915,415,6968,"Before working with Cyberlink PowerDirector I had not used any Cyberlink software beyond PowerDVD, an old version of which came with a computer I bought years ago. My first exposure to PowerDirector itself was version 10 and I was pleasantly surprised with the program. Version 11 makes some improvements over version 10. My review will focus mainly on version 11 independently.

Video editing and production software from most vendors works the same as music editing and production software packages. A timeline view allows the user to drag and drop content onto it and there is a plethora of special effects and transitions that can be applied to each element to make transitions easier and smoother. Users comfortable with the likes of Sony Acid or Cakewalk will feel right at home with this method of working.

PowerDirector provides a nice media manager that gives an excellent thumbnail view of all of the available content, and what comes with the package is a very good library of different types of content. The Media Room contains the actual media available immediately (though more can be imported without too much effort). The Effects Room contains a number of motion and blur effects that can be easily applied to visual elements on the timeline. The PiP (Picture in Picture) Room contains several animation elements, mostly drawing effects. The Particle Room contains a couple of motion-type effects that involve multiple embedded objects. The Title Room is for all things text and text effects. The Transition Room contains transition effects that apply to visual elements and made the change between two elements a lot smoother and/or more interesting. The Audio Mixing Room is a simple equalizer and sound balancer for audio elements. The Voice-Over Recording Room allows for direct recording into the production either through a microphone or from the sound card.

PowerDirector provides the ability to capture input from connected devices such as a webcam or a video recorder. The interface to these devices is very straightforward and simple - there's a record button that turns recording on and off, and there is the ability to change the location of captured content and resolution/bitrate settings.

PowerDirector is able to create media in a number of formats, both audio and video. Supported formats include AVI, MPEG-2, AVC, WMV, MPEG-4, MOV, and MKV files. I was unable to find MP3 file output which is a mild disappointment.

My son likes to make stop-motion videos with Legos, and for this task PowerDirector is well-suited. We have been able to import all of his photos at once (usually over 500 individual pictures) put them all on the timeline, change the display duration and create an initial cut at a video in less than 10 minutes. Cyberlink claims to have fast rendering speeds, and PowerDirector 11 seems to live up to those claims in our workings.

The Ultimate version differs from the Ultra (base) version in that it includes additional content packs and filters. These are nice-to-have additions but are certainly not required to be productive.

Comparing versions 10 and 11, while there is a speed difference and there is some minor tweaks in the interface to make it a little more aesthetically pleasing, I am not sure that there's a compelling reason to upgrade to version 11 if you already have version 10. The main considerations are the speed improvements and the content, and the content does not seem to have changed too much so it comes down to speed. If the optimizations that make version 11 faster than version 10 are crucial, then it's worth pondering the upgrade. Try the trial version first before committing to see if this is worthwhile.

I like PowerDirector. It's a powerful and easy-to-use video production application that does a nice job of allowing a user to assemble a video quickly. The interface is mostly intuitive and the inner workings are efficient. This is a good package at a very reasonable asking price.",software

A lot has changed in the last several years: improvements in voice recognition algorithms, and more powerful home computers have led to software that is impressively accurate right out of the box.  In under five minutes of reading to my computer, I found that the software was giving me near-perfect accuracy.  As a test, I read Walt Whitman's poem, ""When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer"".  I read at a very natural pace (perhaps even a bit rushed), including punctuation, and the software scored 100% for accuracy.

Besides its accuracy, Dragon NaturallySpeaking impressed me with its fairly intuitive set of commands, both for editing documents and for ""getting around"" in Windows and on the web.  Though references are provided to let you know the commands that are available, I found it pretty easy to guess correctly at the commands I needed.  For example, I said, ""search the web for computer science"".  A browser window quickly opened, and took me to the Bing search page to show me the results for ""computer science"".  Preferring Google results, I decided to try ""Search Google for computer science"".  Sure enough, it worked to (as did searching Yahoo).  Then I tried ""search computer for jpegs"" and immediately was presented with a list of jpeg files on my computer.  When I'm not sure what to say, I just need to say ""What can I say"", and Dragon NaturallySpeaking will give me a list of commands.  (And, apparently, I can teach it new commands, but I haven't tried that yet.)  All in all, I found that I could guess the right commands about 75% of the time.

A NOTE ABOUT MULTIPLE USERS: I found it interesting that the software recognized my own voice almost perfectly, but when I handed the microphone over to my 11-year-old son, the accuracy dropped to about zero percent.  Apparently, those five minutes I spent reading must have helped it ""lock in"" to my voice and speech patterns.  I wondered if it would be possible to set up a separate profile for my son.  As far as I can tell, however, the license for this software is bound to ""an individual"".  You, the user, can use the software (even on multiple machines, though not simultaneously).  However, multiple people cannot use the software on one machine unless each gets a license.  Please note that this is my understanding of the license agreement.  Don't trust my interpretation.  If you intend to allow multiple people to use the software, you may want to investigate the exact terms of the license.

One other issue: the installation process was a bit bumpy for me on my Windows 7 Professional 64-bit edition.  And, once installed, I had trouble downloading the free update from version 11 to version 11.5.  However, customer service was helpful in sending me steps to correct the issue.  Now that it's installed and updated, I find it to work very well, and is very unobtrusive.

I cannot draw or make anything resembling a realistic visualized image that has been converted for other people to view. This program however allowed me to create realistic paintings that did a better job than my hand otherwise would have if someone were to give me a paintbrush.

I'm not saying this should take the place of paint and canvas or that it was the paintbrushes' fault. No but this program allows someone with no talent in this art form, like me, to be guided a little better to what fits me as I try to recreate anything on the screen.

For instance the multifarious functions that allow you to change which kind of stroke to use or the method of the stroke (watercolors, paintbrush, pencil) acted a portable art studio with everything at my disposal. I previously had no real knowledge of the different types of things that I could use. This program had it all in front of me (with help menus I might add) that taught me along the way as I learned to use this program.

I used just a mouse (no stylus) so my precision was probably hindered a bit, although I don't think having more control would have helped me much, remember I am not a visual artist. So in essence I'm speaking for people out there that want the bare minimum of this program in that you are buying solely the program itself.

Great aspects of program:
- Has every brush stroke I could think of, with all sizes and shapes to use in an instance
- Has a color palette allowing you to choose any color or mix thereof to suit your need
- Even with a mouse, I was able to create very succinct precision, surprisingly
- Acts as an art studio and art teacher, in that if you haven't caught on to how to make paintings through conventional means this program actually acts as a guide that may be easy to learn from then other forms

Obviously you know that this review is not for the professional for I am just an average everyday software junkie who has no knowledge or art or drawing or programs thereof. I can say, however, that this program was smooth to install, extremely easy to use and taught me some things about drawing on a computer I was never aware of. For that matter, it allowed me to do things with a ""virtual"" paintbrush I never thought I could do. So if there is a budding or curious artist in your, I suggest this program will get you there quicker than a complete art studio would. Of course you are saving much more money too.",software

1938,438,5635,"I went for years without using PC protection of any sort, because I consider myself computer-savvy enough to know that the most important aspects of computer protection are just being able to recognize when something's not right with the machine, keeping personal data in safe places, and knowing where NOT to go online. However, since I have a dedicated machine just for internet access, I went ahead and started using&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AVG-Internet-Security-2011-3-User-Old-Version/dp/B003WT1KFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AVG Internet Security 2011 (3-User) [Old Version</a>]. I had a great experience with that product, and since Kaspersky is the other 'big name' in internet security, I went with this for the sake of comparison.

The good news is that Kaspersky Internet Security is very low-resource, so it doesn't hog memory or processing power. The interface is very intuitive and easy to use, and all the major tools (Firewall, scanning tools) are user-friendly, easily modifiable, and easy to access. One of the things I appreciate about this software is that even when detecting threats, it doesn't automatically make changes to the system or to problematic files, instead giving the user the option to take action- something EVERY protection program should do, and something that distinguishes Kaspersky (and AVG, which operates the same way) from the 'lesser' security products (Norton, McAfee, etc.).

Unfortunately, my practical experience with Kaspersky left a lot to be desired. Firstly, I had to uninstall and reinstall because on the first take, there were a few modules that didn't operate as they should have. I won't go into technical details, but I encountered other instances of the problems I had on the Kaspersky help forums, and reinstallation was Kaspersky's recommended solution.

Secondly (and more importantly), I found the protection to be weak. My first move after installing was to 'test' the protection by exposing my machine to files and online locations that I knew should trigger responses (daring, yes, but I know what I'm doing enough to be able to trigger protection response without actually putting my machine at risk). I was very disappointed in the performance- several items that should trigger ANY protection program simply did not, and several files with known threats scanned clean. Although none of these things were actually threats, I don't like knowing that POTENTIAL threats are going unnoticed, especially when the same threats were recognized by AVG. I had the same experience with several 'hot' online sites- sites that run suspect scripts weren't flagged, and they should have been.

In no way can I say that this will be every user's experience. Kaspersky has a great reputation as a top-shelf product, and I'm hesitant to say that someone who's looking at a security program shouldn't buy this. All I can do is offer MY experience and compare it to my experience with AVG, which was always 'on the ball' in terms of catching potential threats. In the end, I uninstalled Kapsersky and renewed my AVG subscription.

As always, prospective buyers should take my review into consideration along with the reviews of others and try to make an informed decision, but in light of my experience, I can't recommend this product and would instead recommend the latest version of AVG's internet security, which has continued to serve me well.",software

TaxCut software also wins if compared to the free on-line options. I don't like using the on-line tax programs for two reasons (1) I don't want my financial data to be on someone's web site (2) free offers include the Federal tax only.

H&R Block tax software does a good job despite having a few flaws, my two pain complaints:

1. Some forms (such foreign tax credit over the limit to be directly on 1040) require entering data manually. For some reason the software does not do this form automatically. This form is not that hard to do manually as this form does not change year to year.

2. Copy and Paste from Interview screens is not possible. Sometimes I wish to do it for some issue as a reminder to myself. My solution is to do PrintScreen (holding ctl key, shift key, and printscreen key at the same time).

1949,449,9435,"I actually have the previous version loaded on my computer as well, but having so many interruptions this year, I never used it.  I went to a video learning company to see how this version 7 works, about two weeks ago, so I could give this review a better shot.

1. The reason I wanted it in the first place:  I bought a video of a man painting a portrait in Corel Painter.  He uses a transparent background in SketchBook, to do a very (blacks, greys, and whites) lifelike rendering of a man with curly hair, a long, scraggly beard, and amazing features that make artists drool.  He showed how he imports the sketch into Painter, and with layers, he paints the man, lifelike, while erasing the sketch a bit at a time.

2. I wanted software to do renderings (just sketching with black, grey, and white values), and under-paintings, on a less memory-intensive app.  This is a big deal, because I leave a lot of apps running (Photoshop, Painter, Browser with tabs, my calender, and sometimes videos with stop action to remind myself to watch them on my iMac.

3. I was told it is very easy to draw with; I have shaky hands, and, even with a large tablet and pen, I cannot draw a decent curve or straight line.

It is very easy, relatively to draw portraits, or other symmetrical, and semi-symmetrical renderings from life.  As others may have done, I will try to not use technical terms, because I intend to describe their functions, and what they result in (what the results look like), because I get so lost when I hear software-specific technical terms.

This app has traditional-like tools that Photoshop and Painter do not have, like a french curve, for example (which is what artists use to make perfect curves). If you wanted to draw a perfect rounded corner rectangle - to make the rounded edges have perspective.

Let's say you have to make the rectangle, and you want all sides to be the same - there is a tool that will let you draw one part, while the other part draws it's self.  Very cool.

There is a mechanism in the app that lets you draw, not only horizontal and vertical straight lines in either direction, but it enables you to draw a perfect diagonal line.

Let's say you wanted to put an oval or circle with a straight line through the middle; it can be done with the app, without worrying about shaky hands.

If you draw, you would likely know how handy this is.  And a time-saver as well.

It's a pretty intuitive interface - if you realize that some tools are sort of hidden, as on the top-right of the vertical toolbox on the left side of the screen (as it is positioned right after you load it for the first time), there is a small box, you will find the special pens there in all their vibrant colors, that Anime and Mange characters have been created with from where they originated.  (If you want SketchBook just for these type of pens you can download it for free - just search for it.  I don't see any reason, though, to deny yourself all these traditional-like drawing and coloring tools, unless the price point is too steep for you. Flexible pay-as-you-go, and Cloud-based services are available on your desktop for a lower up-front price.

There are all kinds of pens, markers, erasers, pencils that you can customize, and save special as you wish.  It might take you awhile though, to start customizing, as you will have a whole lot of tools already!  Don't forget there are tool tips when you hover over tools and drawing media. You can find a whole bunch of features listed if you go to preferences.  I forget hearing about this in the educational video, but I think the mark-making tools like brushes, etc. are pressure-sensitive with something like a Wacom Tablet.  There are inexpensive ones, and not just Wacom is compatible.  Drawing with a mouse plain old doesn't work well with these types of apps.

Much like in other illustration or design apps, colors can be altered in many ways - or should I say, manipulated.  If you go to preferences you will see how opaque or as rich and bright your colors can be.  You will also find other features that you will most likely find in Photoshop or Painter.  Of course, you can change how many undos, there are selection tools, move, edit, rotate, and scale layers, and so many more features.

There is a toolbar at the top as well as a semicircle of tools - making a total of 5 ways to control the app - if you include your top menu bar, and the preferences.  Click around.  It is impressive for the money.  You can even control where your toolbars go.  Of course, you can push the TAB key on your keyboard and hide everything except the image you are working on.

There is a way to set your image size and, the default file format is tiff., which is a smaller, but decent quality file.  This can be exported into a .tiff, jpeg, .bmp, Pixir PSD, or of course an Adobe Photoshop PSD, which imports nicely into Painter or PS.

Of course - layers to build your sketches, making each layer a different part of the sketch.  To newbies, read documentation of some kind. Search for it online.

And more below:

New features -

There are Perspective Guides to easily lay down perfect 1-point, 2-point, 3-point, and fisheye perspective (if you don't know about artistic perspective - search online)
Also,the flipbook animation tool for expressing motion in sketches - WOW!
And, there is an enhanced layer editor, including expanded blend modes and layer grouping. Blend modes are  effects that you can make specific to separate layers; and, if you want, you can separate a group of layers from other layers to save you time, scrolling to organize and streamline layers.
The dynamic flood fills with solid, linear, and radial gradients - Gradients are two or more colors blending into each other.  Nice fill for backgrounds, making painted-looking drawings look nice - like making a sun look like it is white hot in the center, radiating out to yellow and maybe orange.  Sunsets.  Skies.
The distort transform tool to adjust and position perspective - you can reshape your graphics.
And, finally, improved selection control with polyline and magic wand selection - this means if you want to isolate and manipulate one part of your image, there are tools to do it better.

Highly recommended ""lighter"", but powerful software, with a very attractive interface, workable between multiple apps.  Highly recommended.",software
1950,450,9918,"Ive been using TurboTax since it was first published. Some years I find fault with the program but most of the time it just works. My major complaint is the self-advertising for an endless array of other paid offerings, but I seem to be not even noticing them anymore.

 Since Intuit makes only incremental changes and my tax situation is not complex, it seems to take me a few minutes less each year to complete my taxes because I know the parts of the program I need to use.

 A lot of people have complained of price increases for the program and being forced to buy different, more expensive versions. I find no reason to complain.

 TurboTax has a slight learning curve for new users, but if you follow their guided input and are willing to read the directions (both Intuits and the IRS), everything gets done.

 So TurboTax 2014 looks and feels a lot like TurboTax 2013 and 2012, 2011 and years before that.

 And thats a compliment. I use TurboTax every year because it works. Its that simple.

For me, SM was a god-send ... it breathed new life into an aging machine and allowed me to keep it up and running for 4 more years. I love the product so much that I've used the trial version on my elder parents' machines. I also use it on my DH's machine ... and he's an IT professional. I now have new machine, and one of my first installs was ... you guessed it, SM 9 for Win7.

That said, some words of advice when using SM.

--> Back-up your registry & system before the first install.
--> Check online for updates, especially after the first install.
--> Always, always, always back-up your system & registry before any major changes to you computer, including the ones that SM makes/suggests.
--> Don't use Active Care. Instead, use the individual tools or tool groups.
--> Make changes incrementally. Reboot after making a change & re-analyze for recommendations. Evaluate.
--> Before you make a change, do some research and understand a bit about what the change/fix is. Just because a program suggests a change/fix, doesn't mean that you should make it.
--> SM Standard is probably sufficient. I've previously owned SM Pro and never used the additional features. However, SM Pro is non-subscription pricing but SM Standard is yearly subscription (at least as of the last I checked).
--> Price the SM 3-PC license versions. I've found this to be one of the best values -- only problem, the clock on all the licenses starts ticking on the first install & activation.

That said, SM is a great all-in-one maintenance utility -- it's a worthwhile investment in your computer, and it just might improve your knowledge about PCs. That's what it's done for me.

The reason they will never get me back again is that they tried to conceal those changes, which caused me to have to return the product after I'd bought it instead of just not buying it in the first place.  But I didn't really expect TaxCut to be as easy to use as it has been.  I imported last year's info from TurboTax without difficulty.  The entry of this year's information is just as easy as TurboTax was but, just out of personal preferences, I like TaxCut better.

Simple installation occurred on PC's running Windows 7 64-bit.  The program isn't a terrible resource hog, but after using many, many brands of security suites in the past, to me there was a noticeable slow down in performance.

Malware detection worked great (scanning prior to installation with most current updates - this program found some 'treats' on one of my PC's...), but scans were sluggish once the program was installed.

1957,457,7845,"The latest version of Kaspersky Internet Security offers highly rated protection, including an effective banner ad blocker, which most security suites no longer offer. To me this is a significant feature which has led me for several years to choose Kaspersky software over it's competitors. The reason I couldn't give it 5 stars this time is that it has become less flexible, taking some decisions out of the hands of the user. While for some users this may be preferred (fewer decisions to make), I would rather have more input into how certain situations are handled. Another weak point is the anti-spam utility, which seems to miss certain types of spam and it flags some non-spam e-mails until it has built up a whitelist of OK senders. Having recently reviewed Norton's 360, it does a better job of spam control out of the box. Once trained, Kaspersky does a good job, but this takes time and work on the users part. So if the banner blocker is important for you as it is for me, Kaspersky is a very capable security solution, and I can live with the weakness in anti-spam. Norton's software has better spam blocking capability, but is missing the banner ad blocker. For dealing with most malware, most technical review sites rate them pretty close in capability.",software

The only good thing about it is that it is visually appealing but that is probably part of what makes it so sloooooooooooooow.

The bad - it is sloooooooooow, it crashed right out of the box, seems to not like Flash player, Explorer crashed a number of times just browsing the web, you have to play 20 questions every time you want to install something, its sloooooooooooooooow and this computer has 2 GIGs of RAM - there just isn't that much useful stuff that an OS could have to require anywhere near 2GIGs of RAM.

As soon as I booted it up for the first time and tried to shut down from the start menu, it wouldn't shut down and it didn't say anything, just wouldn't shut down so I had to manually power it off.

The screen flickers on and off at various times when Vista is doing certain things which is strange and sloooooooow but doesn't seem to hurt anything.

The touch pad comes with default settings that make it very difficult to move the cursor while staying in the current application or web page.  If you dig a little bit you can shut that annoying feature off, otherwise your browser starts jumping from site to site if you are using the touch pad to move the pointer.

1970,470,869,"In its early years, this operating system was one of the most unsatisfactory I have ever used --- including DOS, Win 3.1, Windows 95 and Windows 98.

Aside from being incompatible with older hardware, XP Home Edition crashed frequently --- especially if you often work with several windows open at once as I do. This was particularly unhelpful. As a writer, I was forced to save documents no less than once for each new sentence, and at touchy moments, literally every few words.

Most important, the program is highly susceptible to viruses and hackers. Preventing these two problems requires expensive add-on software and hardware.

True enough, the built-in firewall OUGHT to work. But in my case, hackers got in anyway -- four times in six months. With this software, I suffered repeated break ins, the last of which cost me some primary data and several of my original poems. Even installing service pack 2 did not help.

After the last go-round, I was forced to hire an expensive data recovery guru --- another story in itself --- but was still unable to recover everything lost.

Throughout this six-month nightmare, I repeatedly reinstalled the XP program, including, more than once, service pack 2. That, however, didn't plug the security leaks. My computer was completely compromised. In the end, I had to junk the machine all together.

In my experience, Mac and Linux operating systems are both far superior.

Now I've got one Windows machine --- a laptop purchased in early 2007 at or around the release of Service Pack 3 --- to run a BioFeedback program whose authors, unfortunately, had not created a Linux version.

Admittedly, Microsoft's final XP service pack seems to have plugged XP's most serious security holes.

1971,471,2575,"I have been a long-time (and very frustrated) Roxio user who, after crash # 953, finally got fed up and decided to try the trial version of Sony Vegas Pro 8.

Vegas Pro 8, of course, is a much higher-end product than Roxio Easy Media Creator (version 8 referred to herein for comparative purposes), but here are some reasons why you may wish to reconsider:

1.  First and foremost, if you're serious about video editing and wish to explore new and creative ways to create DVD's, this one is a must.  Roxio will continue to place annoying limitations like 60 second menus.

2.  The controls are far more intuitive.  Creating a slow-motion shot in Vegas Pro 8 is as simple as ctrl+clicking and dragging a video clip to the desired length.  Roxio is a frustrating experience of playing with film speeds until the shoe fits.

3.  Playback while editing is no longer a processing problem with Vegas 8.  Roxio Easy Media Creator 8 (on a Pentium 4 2.6 GHZ Hyper-thread, 1 GB of RAM, and a 256 MB Nvidia GeForce 7800 card) has an annoying tendency to choke and run home to mommy when another process happens to run at the same time.  Vegas Pro 8 takes it all in stride.

4.  RENDERING.  OH, YES, RENDERING.  Roxio seems to think that everything needs to be re-rendered even if the edited video was already an MPEG-2 to start with.  VEGAS PRO 8 DOES NOT DO THIS - if it's already in the right format, it won't ruin the quality by recompressing.

5.  RENDER QUALITY.  Roxio offers constant bit rate encoding.  Period.  Vegas Pro 8 offers 2-pass variable bitrate encoding which allows longer videos to be placed on a DVD, while compressing it at a variable rate so that segments requiring higher quality get what they deserve and segments that are relatively static (i.e., pictures) can be compressed at a much lower rate.  Also, a 9 MBPS video encode from Vegas Pro 8 looks better than a 9 MBPS from Roxio.

6.  Capturing.  Vegas will tell me if my mini DV tape had dropped frames (and so far it has not happened at all); Roxio will not (and it HAS).  I'll make a DVD with Roxio and...surprise!!  I need to recapture that portion of the video because it's shot!!

7.  Bugs.  Roxio is buggy...VERY buggy.  Every time I try to make additional copies of a disc image that I put on my hard drive (because I don't want to live through another Roxio video encode), approximately 25-30 error messages (no, I'm not joking) will pop up that I have to repeatedly close out of before I can use the burn utility.  Not to mention that the initial install of Roxio caused my computer to forget that I had a CD-ROM or a DVD drive.  I had to edit my registry keys so that I could ""find them"" again.  Vegas Pro 8 has had ZERO issues with me.

There's more, but why go further?  If you're serious about video editing and production, don't settle for less.  This program will do it all from video editing, importing, capturing, image effects, DVD creation (including menus), and Dolby Digital AC-3 encoding (INCLUDING 5.1!!).  I have only scratched the surface of its full potential--there are plenty of tools to explore in there that can allow you to create very professional looking DVD's.

The software has become more stable over the years, not crashing quite so much.  It's also much faster at editing and rendering than ever before.

The only negative thing about PowerDirector 10 Ultra is the loss of the randomness of the Movie Magic Wizard.  In version 6, I was able to select the entire library of contents and a time frame for the movie and the wizard would spit out a movie with random photos and videos from the library cut to fit the time allotted.  In version 9, the movie wizard would cram every pic and video in the exact order they appear in the library into my movie -- sped up to a dizzying pace when I elected to have a very short movie.  Version 10 is a little better.  It does speed up the pics to fit the movie but I also noticed some videos were left out if there wasn't enough time.  I can also quickly rearrange the photos and videos after the wizard is done and have the wizard redo the movie, which is better than having to go back to the library to rearrange everything.

After making my video via the wizard, I then tamper with it in the main screen.  That's the beauty of having a powerful editor coupled with the wizard.  We get simplicity and versatility in one.  I can add and subtract from the movie.  Of course, movies can be made without the wizard.  I choose not to.

Smartsound is nice.  I've never used it before because it didn't work well, but it does now.  Basically, it's a whole library of music that plays in some sort of endless loop that I can use for my videos.  I can just tell it how long the video is and the music will automatically be adjusted to fit the timeline.  The library is fairly large, including a wide variety of music and some sound effects such as animal sounds and footsteps.  I can usually find something appropriate.  We also have the option of using our own music and capturing our own sounds.

Rendering is quick and easy.  Whereas in the past, this was where my computer would crash and burn, it no longer does.  I like being able to render the video into so many different formats.  I can even make it 3-D, and the box comes with a pair of 3-D glasses just in case I feel the desire to do so.  I can automatically publish it to YouTube or Facebook and a copy of the video stays on my hard drive.  It's so simple, I've already placed a few videos on YouTube over the last couple of days.

Overall, I like this version very much.  It's faster and more stable than ever before, and the Smartsound works.  Just hoping they'll fix the Magic Movie Wizard to be like it was in version 6 and everything would be perfect.

1983,483,3485,"I tried this software out in several languages, and found the learning process to be very easy and intuitive.  I'd recommend it for learning a language, although it will never compare to living in a foreign country and speaking only that language.

Pros:
Rosetta stone's process is a lot better than traditional ""current language word = foreign language word"" learning processes, which rely on memorization and lead to internal translation from the foreign language to one's native language while speaking.  Rosetta stone converts foreign words straight to pictures and ideas, eliminating internal translation to one's native language.  There is plenty of repetition of previous words, but at no point does the process seem like rote recitation.

The software is divided into ""lessons"" which introduce new words, and have several exercises including matching, pronouncing each part of the word, verbally filling in blanks with your new words, etc.  There is plenty to keep you interested and ensure that you learn new words and phrases.

The voice recognition was decent, a simple training has the program hearing you correctly ~90% of the time, and an adjustable slider can reduce the pickiness the software has if you're having issues, although that also controls how strictly you want to be held to pronunciation.

Cons of Rosetta Stone:
-It's expensive
-The approach in rosetta stone does not use conjugations or grammar rules, you just learn words and phrases.  Some maybe bothered by this.
-Many other reviews note technical problems, I had no issues on my PC running windows XP.",software

I use to do computer graphics and fine arts more than a decade ago, but I don't work in that field, and so I only actually need to use a high end graphics program every few months or so.  I've used Photoshop for more than 10 years, but now that Adobe has gone to Creative Cloud with a monthly rental but no purchase option, I need an alternative.  I don't do graphics often enough to justify a monthly fee on the Adobe Creative Cloud plan, and I have concerns about whether I will be able to open files years into the future unless I can own the software.  My personal alternative is the Gnu Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), but GIMP has a clunky user interface.  And, I also recommend software for a small university library where students and staff are also looking for something for occasional use.

Corel Painter 2015 has a decent user interface.  I was able to do simple edits quickly and intuitively.  I was also able to use the User Guide to quickly find and follow instructions for applying a mask.  There are a lot of options, because you can do a lot for it, so I think it's better for someone who has used a high-end graphics program before or who wants to be able to do more.  It was easy to find instructions for using the software.  There is a big long PDF User Guide, tutorials on YouTube (this is officially how Corel makes the tutorials available), and by Googling I could find websites where people talked about using the software.  So, you will be able to quickly find instructions on doing common tasks in Corel Painter.  One thing that bothers me is that the user guide is an included PDF, so I will have it as long as I have the Corel Painter CD, but the tutorials are made available as YouTube videos.  I won't necessarily be able to go back to a tutorial a few years from now, since I can't store them with the software.

I especially like the Quick Clean feature that cleans up my computer's unnecessary temporary files along with clearing the cache and history and other things that take up space and can slow down a computer.

I was hesitant this time when I bought it though, because it was for a download with a subscription code card number.  I've always used a CD for the install in prior years.  When I recently bought a new laptop, I separately bought an external disc drive since my laptop doesn't contain one.

I installed the new subscription on 3/24/2014.  It didn't extend my subscription to 3/26/2015.  Instead, it subscribed me from the date of installation, 3/24 for one year, to 3/24/2015.  So, if you still have a week or two left on your current subscription, I would advise not installing the new one before then.  It's not the worst thing in the world but, it appears you will then lose that week or two that were still remaining on your old subscription.

I do not find that my computer slows down at all on my new laptop.  On my much older PC that runs Vista, there is a noticeable slow down when McAfee is scanning of updating while I'm using the computer.  But, that computer is slow even when nothing is happening to interfere with its performance so I guess Anything that's running in the background would make it operate even slower.  On my laptop that runs Windows 8.1, I find no problem whatsoever.  I've been warned, over the years, not to open certain links or websites and because of McAfee, I've never had a virus, thank goodness.",software
1991,491,7142,"Since Microsoft Office has virtually no competition and is pretty much required for students, workers and those who partake in the 21st century, it's not especially surprising that they are now embracing the annual fee concept. With this Professional code, you don't actually have to pay an annual fee, but it's also only valid for the life of your PC. Your ONE PC. This is definitely not buy it once, have it forever software.  So, in other words, you'll probably have to buy Office code for your other computer or if one crashes. With that in mind, going Home Premium is probably the cheapest bet - and at least you can use the code on up to 5 computers - but you do have to pay up each year if you want to keep your software.

But now that I've griped about that, let me say that I am fairly impressed with the 2013 upgrade. The SkyDrive Cloud concept is obviously the most notable change, allowing you to save directly to your online storage space rather than to the hard drive. I think this is a great way keep documents updated and accessible anywhere without having to e-mail yourself the documents or trying to remember which version is which. Very cool.

Other than that, you'll find mostly cosmetic upgrades that will take some time getting used to and don't serve a lot of purpose, but do look nice. There are some really cool new templates, especially in Excel, that are worth checking out. When you type in Word there is a kind of delay or typewriter effect as the letters appear which is kinda cool I guess. At first I thought it was weird, but now I like it.

OVERALL: Although Office is going a little too far to milk the customer for every penny they're worth, I love the save-to-cloud upgrade that Office 2013 offers and am a fan of some of the new content/layouts. As everyone knows, Office is a must-have for pretty much everything we do in the world nowadays, and it is fabulous software. If you don't care about the cloud, however, don't feel like you have to rush out and upgrade. The new perks are hardly revolutionary, merely cool at best.",software
1992,492,3117,"I have been an avid Norton Symantec user for over 13 years.  This is the worst product EVER. It slows your system down so much that I had to disable most of the features, which an average user will not know how to do.

My biggest complaint is that once the ""virus update"" expires.. it renders the entire software useless. I couldn't even go in and make simple changes to the settings, nothing to do with the virus update feature. PLUS  A pop-up comes up everyday twice a day begging me to buy another year subscription. That is false. What they are really asking is that I buy the software again. Once a year is up .. you might as well throw it in the trash OR give it to someone else OR wipe your hard drive and install a fresh copy.

I am not happy with it at all! I will never buy any anti-virus or internet security software from this company again.  I have heard of complaints that it will crash your system the day it expires.

Uninstalling any Norton products are difficult and you should find a good article on the internet on how to do this.  NOTE: You must uninstall any anti-virus software if you are installing a different brand.",software
1993,493,8984,"I absolutely enjoyed using Sony Movie Studio 13 suite.  It installed without any grief and was intuitively simple to use considering I've used several similar applications and am becoming increasingly skilled with many apps included within my Adobe CC subscription.

Sony Movie Studio 13 Suite is aimed for the audience who is more into social media (it's very easy to share completed videos directly to FB!)  If you don't need some less used pro level tools of Premiere Pro (and After Effects), and want to OWN the software instead of leasing it at approximately $50 / month, then Sony Movie Studio is definitely worth a consideration.

The included Sony Sound Forge Audio Studio 10 is an added bonus for editing, mixing and blending audio tracks.

1996,496,8328,"This review is being written 4/13/2014 for the Norton Internet Security 2014 - 1 User / 3 Licenses [Download], advertised and sold by Amazon on their website.

Unfortunately, I've seen several instances of virus-infected computers that were protected using this product.  The single most important aspect of this software suite to me is to prevent a computer from becoming infected with a virus - hence the failing grade.

The users of computers infected are adults, and I'm often called in to assist with various general computer setup and usage due to my expertise in this field.  I'd characterize these users as average, and the applications they use include banking, music entertainment, social networking, voice/video over IP communications, and some games.  The vector for infection is in the downloading, particularly of games.  Norton has failed to detect these viruses.

Intuit tech indicated that display problem corrections are being worked on for the Accounts List.

Attachments. In Quicken 2006 using any version of Adobe Reader 7 or higher results in you having to manually ""end process"" the ""acrord32"" in Task Manager before you could delete or replace attachments in the registers.
Same problem in Quicken 2010, I had to revert to Adobe Reader 6 if I did not want to end process ""acrord32"" everytime.

This didn't end up being a problem for me because the supplied screws were the exact same size as the ones that were already in my Dean bass.

It would have been nice if the instructions had suggested easier tools for getting on the retaining clip.

There are a couple issues I have encountered. I have found that straplocks extend out just enough to stop my guitar and bass from fitting in the case. Of course that's easily remedied by taking of the strap (which is best to do anyways before packing up), but it's just one more step that can be annoying if you're in a hurry to pack up or get started. Also, I've found that they sometimes rattle a bit when used on my acoustic bass. At some point I'll go in and add some additional padding to remedy the looseness of the fittings.",music

2024,24,6549,"Reading through the reviews for the TU-80, it seems theres a lot of grumbling that misses the point of what a tuner should do. Above all, it should be accurate and clear in the readings it gives. Too often tuners fail to do this. The reading wanders back and forth, never quite settling on whether the note is flat, sharp, or dead on. For a tuner, this is entirely unacceptable. A tuners job is to tell us whether or not the note is in tune. If the tuner cant make up its mind, then whats the point of having it?

While I cant say Ive tried every tuner on the market, Ive tried many. Most recently I auditioned the Guitar Research JC 200, Sabine MT 9000, Korg TM-40, Fishman FT-1, Korg MA-30, and the Korg GT-3. With the exception of the Sabine, all of them more or less display the problem I described above. (The Sabine MT 9000 has a different problem: it takes too long to give a reading after you play a string.) For my taste, the Boss TU-80 was superior to all the tuners listed here. It was quick to give a reading, and the reading didn't waver about.

Currently, these are my standard tuner recommendations to my guitar students:

 For a cheap tuner, the Korg GA-1.
 For a mid-priced tuner, the Boss TU-80.
 For a higher priced tuner, the Boss TU-12.
 For gigging players, the Intellitouch PT30 or the SpeedPro Chromatic Guitar Tuner

Regarding the complaints that the TU-80 has trouble hearing a note: Most tuners have this problem to some degree, depending on the player, the instrument, and how far away the tuner is placed from the instrument. For acoustic guitarists, I suggest laying the guitar on your lap (soundboard side up) and setting the tuner directly on the soundboard. You neednt bang out the note, as doing this on the bass strings will cause the tuner to rattle against the soundboard. Just pluck the string at a medium volume, and the tuner usually will have no trouble sensing the vibration of the soundboard. Bear in mind also that some tuners have trouble hearing the bass strings. (The original Intellitouch tuner was notorious for this.) If your tuner doesnt hear the bass strings well, play the string at the 12th fret harmonic.",music

My guitar sounds more full bodied, and beefy. Crisp and in stays in tune better than the other strings. The nickel wound strings are better than other nickel wound strings I have used, including the ones mentioned above. Gibson has a technique that is unique to their strings.

Nevertheless, I'm pleasantly surprised with this capp. I have another, what I would call a ""lever-action"" capo, that I got for about the same price. I have been reasonably happy with that one, but this particular capo exerts more pressure than the G7th capo I bought for easily twice the price. In fact, I find this one to be a better capo than the G7th. MOre than likely, I will robably alternate between my new Shubb and this capo, so I am very happy with it.",music

2087,87,8959,"I know a lot of guitarists aren't near as picky about picks as I am.  So why should you be?  After all, there is no pick that will make you play better and they are all generally the same.

WRONG.  I thought that too at first.  I figured it's just a piece of plastic, how hard can it be to pick one?  I started out with fender pick because they looked pretty conventional and they were moderately priced.  I blindly went through about ten of these due to them all breaking.

If you knew me well you'd know that I thrash my guitar...a lot...  Even the thickest picks would wear down on me within a week, and most of them were too slick to stay in my sweaty hand during these crash and burn guitar playing moments.  I came to realize that I needed a heavy duty pick with a good grip that would retain it's shape for at least a couple of weeks.

At first I thought metal was the answer.  I mean, it's hard as rock and most of them come with a good grip on them.  But after playing with them I discovered the sound was not to my liking.  It sounded too buzzy with metal.  That's about the time I discovered tortex picks.  I was amazed.  They had the best grip I have ever felt and kept their shape for weeks!  I instantly bought every size I could get all the way from the thinnest read to the bulky blue one.

Months later I'm keeping a stock of these picks in my house.  For solos I prefer the green one because it's got just the right resistance for that fast picking but not too much so that it slows you down.  For strumming I use the orange.  It's just perfect...

I cannot express to you how much you need to try this pick.  Your wasting your money on anything other than Dunlop.  Get the tortex and see what I mean!",music

2107,107,45,"Can't believe this little gem. I ordered one for my wife sort of as a joke but after a week she was strumming songs on the guitar without the Chordbuddy. Last Sunday night, five weeks later, we had a picking at our church and she played along with us for two hours.
Now a couple of things, l have played guitar professionally for years and I was able to show her some shortcuts and ""tricks"". She has learned to move between most chords quickly and without difficulty. I have her using a capo for songs in the key of C as she has some trouble holding F chord but she will master that.
Also, the instruction materials that come with the system are great. She faithfully practiced for at least an hour every night sore fingers and all but after five weeks I can't believe what she has accomplished.
I don't believe that just anyone could do what she's done in five weeks because she was driven to play. I have a small recording studio and she plays piano for our recording sessions which helps her as she understands cord progression and structure.
But... If you have wanted to learn to strum a guitar using proper chords to play most any songs, don't hesitate to get the Chordbuddy. It is beyond doubt the best way to learn to play a guitar I've ever seen!",music

I can only get the 4 mics and their 4 mic clips to fit in the case, the latter in the zippered pouch in front. Not sure what I will use the internal square cut out for, it could hold another mic.

There is no storage area for ""cables"" if by cables you mean microphone cables. I removed the shoulder strap and intend to set the case inside the cable crate I take to gigs. No doubt it will provide years of dependable service.

After 30 years of hauling gear that was huge and heavy, how refreshing to get such MASSIVE sound from this small amp! I had total faith she'd sound amazingly good, and as soon as I began to play I smiled big time. A 10"" speaker putting out virtually any tone with such clarity makes this a fantastic practice amp, and one could even gig with it in a small lounge type setting, perhaps run a line to the board.
The bottom line though is this is meant to be a practice amp, yet it has more clear output than you'll need. Beautiful mellow tones, yet has the ability to deliver the ""bite"" needed. Virtually any style of music will make you smile as I did...and am.",music

The price was right for what I needed and I'm very happy.  I haven't used them for causal listening but that's not really what I bought them for.

I mainly use this pedal as a boost -  I have the drive set to about 9 o'clock, tone set to 12 o'clock, and the level set somewhere to the right of 12 o'clock (depends on my mood and the situation.)  This helps push my lead channel over the edge a bit, and it also gives a nice boost to the clean channel, helping to get that saturated tube sound at lower volumes.

For those on a budget, the Boss SD-3 Super OverDrive pedal would make a decent substitute.  It's not quite as warm, but it works.",music

My main gripe is that the rubber piece where the cable meets the connector fell out of the connector with almost no pressure whatsoever applied to it. The purpose of this piece is to keep cable bending force from getting inside the connector and damaging the connections between the wires in the cable and the connector pins (usually solder connections). With the rubber piece not serving this purpose, the cable is likely to fail much sooner than it should. I tried to force the rubber piece into the connector but was unable to. Maybe if I disassemble the connector... but hey, I shouldn't have to do that. Maybe this cable is OK for a studio where it is installed and never moved, but I would never take it out on a gig.",music

2134,134,52,"I was curious as to how the Chord Buddy would work. Actually I was curious as to IF it would actually work, and this is what I've found thus far - Once you get the Chord Buddy installed on your guitar properly it works like a charm. I installed mine on a Squier Strat and found it was very easy to adjust properly. Within a minute or so I was playing chords easily and could work on my timing & strumming. Shortly thereafter I was playing LaBamba. I believe that it is important to make sure you install it absolutely in the proper position. I did find that it fits my Squier Strat better than the acoustic I also tried it on (although it does fit the acoustic, just not quite as well - a bit of string buzz, but still playable).
I can't speak as to whether the Chord Buddy will actually help with finger dexterity (it very well could) or help actually learning to play the chords (it might) since I've had it less than a week, but it certainly helps me work on timing & strumming as I mentioned above.
I do believe the Chord Buddy will be an excellent tool to get my daughter more interested in playing the guitar and that is definitely a good thing. I think it's a great idea and time will tell how well it helps with finger dexterity. But for now I give it 4 Stars as it is easy to use and actually quite fun.",music

I gave up playing in clubs years ago and now I play primarily for my enjoyment and I write and record my original tunes in my home studio. Whether I am using an axe with single coils or hum buckers, this pedal shines. I have always felt Boss makes the best pedals and I have many Boss products. I also have some EH, Dunlop and MXR pedals. I used a Tube Screamer for a short while and never understood the hype it gets. This pedal blows the Ibanez out of the studio and off the stage.

2146,146,6402,"Some of the reviews I read are negative, which is surprising but, at the same time, something I do respect. IMHO, when it comes to sound there is nothing set on stone; it all comes down to personal taste. My very fist guitar pedal was a BOSS (actually it was a distortion pedal, but not this one), and I still have it and use it. BOSS builds quality lasting products. This company is owned now by Roland, which is mainly known for their keyboard line. I don't see any compromise in quality, though, and the tone (which is the most important aspect of getting a guitar pedal), is top notch. Again, this is for my personal taste. If you like other pedals, it's great, but trashing this product just because you don't like it, it's kind of not fair.
I specifically wanted to add this particular DS-1 pedal to my pedal board because Joe Satriani and Tom Morello, two players I am into a lot lately, use them (or have used them in the past), and I am getting exactly what I was looking for.
If there is one downside to pedals is the price. Once you buy 5 or 6 different pedals, you are looking at hundreds of dollars, and that kind of sucks, but as far as my taste goes, I like stompboxes better than other systems.",music

2156,156,99,"The other reviewers wrote some great info about this Microphone.  Some drawbacks are the relatively bulkyness of this unit as compared to others.
The sound quality is sufficiently clear when recording, but is not sensitive enough to satisfy the most demanding users such as musicians or professional reporters.  As the other reviewers have said, you need a relatively loud source as there is no sensitivity switch or zoom feature.  It does have the 90-120 degree switch, so you can toggle the range depending on what you are recording.
This microphone is very compatible with many different devices.  MD is the best though.
Here's one MD player recorder that I know has the microphone jack and works great with this microphone:
'Sony MZ-NF810CK Net MD MiniDisc Recorder with Car Kit'
However, don't be fooled.  Not every MD player has the appropriate Mic Jack.  Double Check the technical documentation to make sure.  Units that definitely do not have it are:
'Sony MZ-NE410 High Speed Net MD Walkman Recorder'
Notice the deceptive ""Recorder"" moniker in the product name.  Don't be fooled!  Very few MD ""recorders"" actually record with a microphone!
Not sure about these:
'Sony MZ-NF610 High Speed Net MD Walkman Recorder'
'Sony MZ-N510CK NetMD Walkman/Recorder with Car Kit'

I don't foresee subjecting the guitar to a situation whereby I needed a more heavy-duty case anyway.  One minor complaint is that the inside of the case had an odor upon arrival which I could not quite identify (it had a smell almost like funky beef jerky- no kidding!).  After leaving the case open for a week, the smell dissipated.

At any rate, I recommend this case and believe it provides great value for an Epi SG 400.",music

2191,191,5732,"I was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product. A work-around for the main issue follows the review. The flaws that bother me in order of significance are:

1) Quality: Very weak soft-metal screws. Using minimal force and a well aligned driver there was some damage to the screw-heads on all 4 that I worked with. 2 of them rounded out so much that I was afraid they would be hard to remove later, causing me to run to the hardware store for higher quality replacement screws.

2) Engineering : The instructions recommend, and the screws (the ones that come with the straplocks) are designed for a #2 Phillips screwdriver. However, a standard #2 driver is too big to fit into the strap-buttons. So you are likely to have to choose between grinding down a screwdriver to fit, or using a #1 which will increase the impact of the first problem above since it is the wrong tool for the job.

3) Engineering : The point of connection for the strap is 5/8th of an inch out from the guitar. The strap button has a radius about 3/16ths of an inch. Therefore any lateral stress (i.e. weight of the guitar) is magnified by more than 3x due to leverage pulling outward on the screw. A 9 pound guitar would be applying a constant 27 to 30 pounds of force on the screw and the wood around it (half that when the weight is distributed evenly on two strap buttons of course). Get a little too active on stage and the level of force could go way higher.

Realistically, if the screws weren't total crap, this might have been a 3 or 4 star review. Once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver won't fit and get the things properly installed, it would probably work out for most people. So if you are stuck with a set, here's what I recommend:

Go to a hardware store and buy #6 x 1"" oval-head stainless steel replacement screws. Note that these won't fit properly, but they are the closest match and can be modified. (They are 21 cents each at my local stores, and would have cost Dunlop maybe 10 cents more in bulk than what they paid for the crap screws that come with this.)

Put the screw into an electric drill (pointy end in) so the screw head is rotating smoothly when you operate the drill. Run the drill while using a file or a belt sander to take a fraction of the diameter off the screw head. It doesn't need much. I used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each. While you are at it, file down a cheap #2 screwdriver so it will fit into the strap button.

Install with the new screws as normal, and recommend that your friends try a different brand!",music
2192,192,3545,"The Beta 58A along with the original SM58 are industry standards, that's well known. As a general purpose workhorse for live vocals they are by far the most popular tools out there. Quality venues throughout the country commonly stock these as their go-to house mics. In fact, I noticed Betas all over the place at a small theater (with a high-end system) that I played at just recently.

I had used the old 58 for years before moving to the Beta and there is certainly a noticeable difference between the two. The Beta is definitetly hotter, with a more sensitive response. Your vocals will cut into the mix strongly and with more clarity than you might be used to. Mids and highs are picked up perfectly when singing a few inches away and there is a subtle low frequency roll-off to avoid that boomy, muddled sound you typically get when hitting low or quiet notes up close. You definitely need to stay within a close range though as the pickup pattern is very tight. This is a good thing because extraneous noise and feedback is effectively rejected.

""Built like a tank"" is probably a bit overused when describing products but Shure's vocal mics truly earn that title. They can take an enormous amount of abuse and never falter. Toss it around, drop it, bury it under other stuff, etc., NO problem. When you are maintaining a bunch of music gear, it's nice to have tools that you never worry about. For that reason, I'd highly recommend getting a used one if you can find a deal. Chances are, its in working order no matter what.",music

2194,194,3384,"This guitar stand was one of the better options compared to the cheapy stands you can buy. I don't gig with my stand, it simply sits in my practice space and holds my guitar. After owning the stand for about a year out of nowhere one of the front legs gave out and my G&L hit the floor. After inspection the plastic locking mechanism simply broke just from the constant weight of the guitar hanging on it. I contacted Ultimate and they sent me out a replacement locking mechanism and I drilled out the rivet and replaced. Worked fine for 4 months and the exact same thing happened but this time I was simply hanging the guitar and the leg gave out so my Legacy didn't hit the floor. Called Ultimate again and they are now sending me a complete new stand. Still not satisfied with the safety of my guitar on this stand old or new I again took apart the old stand and cut a piece of metal pipe ( top rail pipe of chain link fence fit perfect ) that fits super tight in the bottom hole for the locking mechanism and simply made it to where the stand will no longer collapse for transport. I really like the stand but I will no longer trust Ultimate with the safety of my instruments with the way it is manufactured.",music
2195,195,5361,"This cover is a perfect fit with room to spare. No struggling to manoeuver the  fabric onto the keyboard. I just remove the music stand, place it in a ""good"" spot on the unit and cover the whole business. Easy-peasy. The stretch makes the covered keyboard look tidy and is much more attractive than the picture. As someone else mentioned, there would be ample room for headphones to be stored under the cover as well. The cover works nicely while the piano is set up on its stand and does not compress the cord plugs, put pressure on wires and connections, etc.

The cover appears to be well-constructed of quality materials. The spandex is very stretchy and forgiving, while at the same time nicely dense and closely woven. The elastic cording is contained in a heavily-serged seam which looks as though it will stand the test of use and time.

I'm very pleased with this purchase and expect it will keep my keyboard clean, dust-free, and unattractive to curious cats.

UPDATE: I'm happy to report that the Gator cover has met my expectations on all counts and seems to have cat repellent qualities which makes me very happy. I have discovered that I can stretch the cover over the instrument without removing the music stand and have _almost_ total coverage. The back side of the keyboard is visible with two small area open areas on either side of the music stand. However, the speakers, all the little dials and buttons, as well as the keys are concealed (and protected).

An absolutely outstanding way to treat customers I would only hope that some other companies start to treat people the same way.

The Kyser Capo itself is a great Capo with just one major flaw which depending on how you look at it can be a major flaw or a minor flaw. The problem is the adjustability of the tension. There are YouTube videos out there from Kyser themselves explaining how you can actually been this into adjustability that you can work with. The problem is it doesn't exactly work is easily as they say it does. They are absolutely wonderful to deal with and they actually replaced an older capo for me free of charge. They claim that the older materials were not conducive to flexibility so they took it upon themselves to offer me a newer model. I appreciated that so much by that company that I ordered this one on Amazon just to show my support. Unfortunately it is still extremely difficult to pin this item to the desire tension that you needed for various guitar. Again I feel it is in either minor or major flaw depending on how many times you use it how many different guitars you use with it and so on. Myself, find this to be a minor flaw which is why I feel it gets an outstanding four star review. Of course with this one drawback it prevents me from giving it that final V Star which I allocate for absolutely perfect products that work flawlessly for me.

Kyser is an absolutely wonderful company to work with and they were very accommodating and I appreciate that and I will continue to support them and use their Capo happily, butt I just feel that it comes ever so sure of that 5-star because of that one option.

Now as far as the rest of the Capo goes it is of course very easy to take on and off, attached to the end of the headstock if you wish, to get enough tension on just about any acoustic 6 string guitar that you're using it on. I don't believe that weight is really that significant for CatOS in this day in age, but to be thorough it is obviously a very light unobtrusive object to keep on the neck. It doesn't make the neck heavier and does not seem to alter the way the guitar feels feels in any way shape or form. It opens and closes snugly but you should be able to get used to that rather quickly. It is made like a truck so I don't believe you will have any problems in a year or 30 years. And I believe that the parts are replaceable where there is were possible. As stated before because of the great white shark like tension on this item you will not have a problem with string buzzing because of lack of tension.",music

When I first opened it I immediately noticed that there was no strong 'new case' odor. (I usually air out a new case for a day or two before putting my guitar in it. There was no need to with this case.) I really appreciate the 'safety latch' on the opposite side from where you open it, this looks like added protection from the case inadvertently flying open. The case also has a locking latch for security, however please note that it only comes with one key - another key would be nice, just in case (no pun intended). A nice touch is the very large, well-cushioned carrying handle which allows you to maintain a comfortable grip. The metal feet on the back & the bottom of the case are also appreciated - You can actually stand the case up on the floor without leaning it on something due to the feet on the bottom (I'd be worried a pet might bump it an knock it over though). As stated, the interior is very well padded, and it features a wonderful covered compartment in which to carry accessories such as picks, a tuner, a strap or an instrument cable etc.
I really like the fact that because it is made for a specific model guitar, the Epiphone Les Paul case is no bigger than it has to be. You'll be surprised at how compact it is. Not only will this easily fit in the 'way back' of my SUV, but it will also easily fit in my convertible which I can't say for my large ABS cases that I keep my Telecaster & Stratocasters in. Granted the large ABS cases have lots of bins for storage inside, they are also heavy & more difficult to carry around, where this case is much easier to carry & has enough storage for just what you need to take along with your Les Paul Guitar.

Gator cases lists several models on their website that will accomodate an S6, but if you do a little measuring most are going to wind up either a little tight or loose in several spots.

This is imho THE BEST fitted case for a seagull s6 original, the middle bout width is nicely snug, and the body length is pretty close. No tight spots anywhere, but no movement to speak of either, maybe a half inch lengthwise.

Will doubtless also fit the electronic S6, as there is a little extra space at the bottom for the connector.

Nice padded interior, looks solid enough, latches iffy at delivery time, but I think they'll settle in, hence the 4 stars. Heavy case. Has a compartment for small items, but no pouch for books. I'd suggest a thin cloth bag to hold one or three, laid flat under the guitar...

Case a little heavy, but it's a keeper for keeping your prized guitar safe.

I'm sure that made very little sense, but it's a nice comfortable finish, a little bit like tortex picks, but not so grippy. I've just got a few pieces of info that might not be obvious from the picture.

- These picks are just slightly transparent. Light passes through, and if your finger is pressed against the back, you can tell what it is, but it isn't as transparent as glass. More like a roughed up beer bottle.

- As compared to the system a lot of pick makers use: extra light, light, medium etc etc, .73 falls somewhere between light and medium (at least as compared to fenders. These are just slightly thicker than a yellow tortex .03mm to be exact.

-The roughed finish goes away eventually, but I've usually lost them long before that happens.

Not much else to say, they're pretty much like any other guitar picks. I've never had one tare or crack on me, but that's rare in the first place. I mostly get them because I like the texture, and prefer the picture of the rhino to the turtle. Stupid, I know, but that's my reasoning.",music

Mine was shipped in a cheap cardboard box within box but somehow managed to survive the ordeal of shipping without incurring any damage (in spite of a big hole on the outer carton).  The Amazon product picture does not do the guitar any justice.  Amazon really should update it.  The guitar ""in person"" looks drop-dead gorgeous - with a glossy deep cherry finish that still allows you to see the wood grain through it.  The Amazon picture just looks flat in comparison.

The fit and finish on my guitar was absolutely flawless, as good as my multi-thousand dollar guitars!  The double cream binding on the body looks great.  The frets could probably do with a little bit of polishing/reshaping or I may just simply play the guitar until they wear in a little bit.  This is common for guitars that come from the factory.  Speaking of the factory, mine is made in Indonesia and the guitar comes with a ""set up in the USA"" label and checklist that is hand-checked and signed.  One thing you must do when you get the guitar brand new is to tighten the truss rod as it will have been loosened for shipping.  Mine was completely loose when it arrived and there was a very slight bow in the neck as a result that was easily fixed by tightening the rod until it was no longer completely loose but not too tight either.  I also lowered the bridge slightly from the factory setting.

Without plugging it in, the guitar sounds lovely - that's why I love semi-acoustics!  The natural sustain is very, very impressive.  I'd say this guitar sustains better than my Fender Stratocaster.  The stock pickups sound very good to me.  My other guitars are all equipped with single-coil pickups so I love the contrast the Epiphone Dot's stock pickups give me.  You can eaily get a great sustaining blues or jazz sound.  It can even do some nice jangly sounds on the bridge pickup if I play with the EQ on my amp.  I'm sure if I upgraded the pickups to the Gibson '57 ones the guitar would sound even better, but frankly, I'm totally happy with it stock.

Overall I'm really pleased that I got this.  It's the lowest cost guitar I own but it holds its own against the rest of my collection.  I've been wanting a ES-355 style guitar for some time now and I'm delighted with what I got.  You can't beat this value!!",music

When you then further consider the portability, functionality and performance, they are fully worth their premium price tag. I was initially sceptical about the high price, having bought them after all my others, and for more money, but I now think they may well have been my best-value purchase of the lot. I certainly use them more than all the others for convenience including outside jobs with potentially suspect weather (I got the matching outdoor speaker covers and so they can play on their stands outdoors in light rain). I remember at an outdoor gig once, the wind blew my projector screen unto my K10 speaker and stand, so that the K10 fell about 7ft to the hard asphalt ground. It suffered a small dent on the front grill (was in the cover), but did not skip a beat and kept right on playing through the incident, and have continued on with no problems ever since

2327,327,8649,"*** update after several hours of playing and practice before switching back to my Hohner Special 20 in G ***
+++ a day later ... I am liking it better ... and I will explain at the end +++

I started with a cheap Hohner Blues Band, and have (in about 6 months) tried several excellent Hohner harmonicas. They include the Golden Melody (C), Special 20 (G), and Chromonica 270 (C). I recently bought the Hohner Blues Harp in G and thought I would share a few comparative notes.

Some things I like about the Blues Harp over the other 3 are:
- The case - it allows the harmonica to breath (vital for the wood comb) and holds it firmly in place (I won't hear the harmonica tapping the sides of the case if I walk around with it inside my pants pocket as I do with the Golden Melody and Special 20)
- The hardware - the screws are solidly built (machined) for ease of dissassembly/reassembly
- The reed plates - these are thicker than on any other harmonica I've owned - they only need 2 screws plus the 2 cover plate screws to keep these in place (compared with 5 or more screws commonly seen on lighter weight plates). That shows how solid/thick these plates are.
- The wood comb - makes it seem a little more of a traditional instrument (don't get me wrong - I love plastic for its durability)
- The reeds - these things are QUALITY - Hohner has their machining process down to a science on these things and they are beautiful works of art compared to the other harmonicas I've taken apart

What's not to like? Well - some people have complained about how the reed plates jut out a little from the front of the comb - about how some models have actually been sharp (rough edge on lips). I've learned how to adjust my lips so that I can get a tighter seal because if I don't, I tend to get a little more harmony than melody going. The edges have been comfortable to play on. But it does require an ever so slightly different lip seal than I learned playing on the Golden Melody and Special 20 (both which have significantly cover styles from each other).

***
After spending a few hours playing the Blues Harp in G and trying to learn an Irish Jig, and then returning to my Special 20 (also in G), I quickly discover that on the Special 20 (with its plastic comb), it requires far less effort to maintain a seal with my lips and I get a much more solid single note sound for my efforts. I blame this on the wood comb on the Blues Harp not extending out to the front edge of the reed plates. I assume this problem exists because Hohner expects the comb to swell with time and use.
***

Who is this harmonica best for? Maybe not the beginner (consider one of the other 2 models like the Golden Melody or Special 20 which both have a plastic comb). When you get this harmonica, you will want to baby it. Slowly break it in playing softly for a week or two. Keep it in its case at all times to keep the scratches off the covers. Never try to rinse out the comb. Knock out any moisture after every playing session. This is good for the intermediate/advanced player who has learned to appreciate their instrument and takes the effort to do things like rinse/brush their teeth before playing.

Hohner considers this model to be part of their professional series. With that in mind, they sell replacement reed plates (think of it like a very expensive new set of strings for a guitar).

***
I now assume it's for professionals because they will have developed their playing technique to the point that they are more able to hit the notes regardless of the wooden comb's gap from the front of the reed plate.
***

Is there a big difference in sound between this and the others? I'm not qualified to answer that question. Well - actually I can say that every one of these Hohner's made in Germany harmonicas blow the made in China Blues Band out of the water in terms of quality and playability out of the package (I have since learned how to tweak and retune the cheap Chinese Blues Bands to make them playable, but they are significantly inferior - you truly get what you pay for). Since I have tinkered with the reeds on most of my harps (gapping on most of them for consistent playability), I feel that my experience looking inside of the few harps I have owned qualifies me to say that the Blues Harp is a high quality instrument and I am proud to own one.

***
Do I now wish I still bought the Blues Harp - I'm not sure. I will keep it just because it is beautiful plus it is too late to return it. Perhaps if I really preferred the MS series of harps with their exchangeable components, I should have tried one with a plastic comb instead. I bought it on a whim thinking it would be cool, and it was purchased from a local retailer that was not a national chain nor had a wide selection. I'm glad I supported the retailer, but I will think twice before I purchase another harmonica with a wood comb (besides the Chromonica which had a nice metal mouth piece over a wood comb - not an issue there). And - who knows - perhaps the more I play with the Blues Harp, the better my technique will improve. I think my skills are still in the beginner/intermediate range.
***

+++
I have since discovered that the small gap between the front face of the comb and the reed plates on the low end of the harp (holes 1-4) was easily fixed by loosening the two screws holding the reed plates together and pushing the comb forward between the two plates. It is now properly flush and plays better.

I like this  harp - it has its place for blues (as opposed to the Golden Melody which plays folk music better). It now bends very nicely when properly gapped (I tightened up the gap on day 1, and widened it today (day 2) until I could get a good balance between bending and playability).

This is a keeper and a great bending harp. If you want an all purpose workhorse, you might want to cut your teeth on the Special 20 and then decide if blues (Blues Harp) or folk (Golden Melody) is more for you. The Blues Harp is easier to play when I'm not playing single notes (dare I say it doesn't hurt as much).

2337,337,4940,"The ernie ball 2047 is a great string set. If you like bending notes the 10 e string is more than malleable to your every move. These strings are the brightest silk and steel I've found yet and give a really nice sound. The 50 e string on the bass end  is a bit noisy when you slide your finger down it, but its accoustic music, its supposed to have unique sounds. These last a fair amount of time and don't completely lose their tone if you play the dickens out of them and wait a bit to change them.

They offer a completely different feel and sound to the Martin silk and steel which I also use. Its amazing how much different a set of strings can change a guitars sound.

These are very easy on the fingers and have a great blues sound. Throw the empty string packaging in your  guitar case so you'll remember what to buy next time its time to change strings.
I could do a nice vibrato across 4 strings with a single finger with these strings, ala steel guitar/slide guitar using my naked index finger without grinding the skin off, I haven't found another set of string that is this accomodating as yet.

2338,338,2581,"I made the mistake of thinking I could save forty bucks and get by with the Shure PG-58.  I'm no vocalist but occasionally need to do announcements or accommodate a guest vocalist through an instrument amp (rather than a P.A.). Whatever the reason, the PG-58 simply doesn't have sufficient gain or oomph to be of much use with the Roland Cube / Peavey amps I try to employ it with (I use a 1/4"" adapter with the XLR connector that comes with the mic).  When I borrow a Shure SM-58 mic from someone, the difference is instant and dramatic--it's a far more efficient (i.e. louder) mic, producing a full, clear sound, and without additional pre-amplification, demonstrating why it's the most popular microphone in the world.  For five bucks extra, I can't fathom a reason for avoiding the SM-58S, the version with an on-off switch.  It's a small price to pay for quick solutions to feedback or the unwanted pick-up of ""private"" comments by indiscreet band members.  And even if you're an instrumentalist, it may be wiser to select the SM-58 over the SM-57.  The former mic is a little more ostentatious, but it's also slightly more adaptable, and the screen can filter out a certain amount of wind noise and unwanted non-musical sounds. Above all, the SM-58 has proven itself to be the Sherman tank of microphones, simply unparalleled for ruggedness and durability.

[I see a review cautioning the consumer to be wary of ""this seller.""  Perhaps a good point unless it's in reference to Amazon Prime, which is the Shure SM-58 of commerce: competitive prices, no postage, easy returns.  But anyone who returns an SM58 probably had no business buying it in the first place.  They are the populous drones of the industry, invariably purchased by professionals who know first-hand what they're getting--reliability and virtual indestructibility.  In fact, it's the very popularity of the SM58 that has led to all of the slightly less or more expensive imitators.  Consumers require choice, but with the Shure SM58 there need be none.]",music

2350,350,1457,"I couldn't figure out why my studio monitors were so noisy with a constant buzz, was even thinking of returning them or having them repaired. It turned out to be because I was connecting them to my audio interface with unbalanced 1/4"" TR to XLR microphone cables.

2351,351,8088,"THis is a very articulate pickup! It voices every nuance of your playing...even those you aren't aware of like string squeak and pick misalignment! I suggest you install this in a guitar that has a very warm wood species (mahogany). This is a very bright pickup and putting it in a biright sounding guitar body (basswood) would make it painfully bright sounding. I installed mine in a mahogany Ibanez RG and it sounds KILLER! Nice, bright highs and deep, ballsy low end with just enough mid range to stand out! I would have given 5 stars but the fact that the housing is plastic kind of takes away from the quality aspect slightly. Plastic will degrade and split over time... but I still love this pickup!

This gig bag looks really sharp, and has two shoulder straps for convenient carrying.",music
2356,356,1784,I use this cable to connect my ipod mp3 player to my guitar amplifier 'cd input' jack.  I prefer cables that have all metal connectors so that is why I did not give this cable a five star rating.  The cable works fine despite that it has molded plastic connectors at both ends.  The cable supports two channel audio (stereo) but since I use it to connect to a mono device (a one speaker guitar amplifier) I don't get (or need) stereo sound by using the cable.  I am happy with the performance of the cable for home use but would not advise using it where it is likely to encounter rough treatment .,music
2357,357,3809,"I don't own this guitar personally but I have spent time playing a friend's, and it's a decent guitar.  It's really not bad and it's a solid beginner's guitar with some room for improvement.  I found the neck to be decent, the pickups workable, and overall build pretty solid.  But that's it.  For nearly $300 you get a decent guitar that nearly every other beginner ever has used at some point.

All of which is fine, and I could end my review here.  But odds are, if you're seriously looking at this guitar, you're a beginner or intermediate player, perhaps looking for an upgrade from your Squier Bullet Strat or cheap Wal-Mart acoustic.  This is an extremely popular model because it's made by a subsidiary of one of the most famous guitar companies in the world.  And if you're like I was at one point, you might not have even heard of any of the comparable alternatives.

1)  Schecter
I own a Schecter Omen 6, purchased at $300 even, and it blows the Epiphone out of the water in terms of speed, playability, and sexiness.  It could have been the luck of the draw, but I do feel that Schecter makes a superior guitar at just a fraction of the cost more than this one.

2)  Rondo Music
If you are indeed a beginner, you probably haven't even heard of Rondo Music.  They aren't as well known because they spend nothing on advertising or brand naming.  All that money saved goes directly into quality, and boy does it show.  You have two general groups of options if you're looking for a Rondo alternative to the Epi LP-100:

a)  SX Callisto (or other SX) - SX guitars are made in China and can be found ridiculously cheap (the most expensive custom models top out at $200) and will likely match, if not outperform, the Epiphone and save you $100 as well.  I just ordered an SX Callisto Custom at $160 yesterday - it has a set neck compared to the Epi's bolt-on, block inlays compared to the Epi's dots, quilted maple top compared to the Epi's plain top, and at under 2/3 the cost.

b)  Agile - Rondo's Agile guitars are less common than Epiphones, but have developed quite a cult following, for good reason.  An Agile AL-2500 series guitar (see pic) costs between $250 and $300 and will typically match an Epiphone Les Paul Standard Plus top, which runs about double the cost.  Go even higher up, and an Agile AL-3200 will compete with Gibsons and Fenders - without paying for the name (or American labor costs).

This isn't to trash the Epiphone.  It's a decent guitar and generally quite solid and reliable.  If brand name means a lot to you, then by all means, get the Epiphone.  I simply feel that you're putting at least a hundred dollars into the name on the headstock, and that there are definitely better alternatives at the price that you should check out.

Quick takeaway - Unless the name on the headstock means everything to you, an Agile AL-2500 is a far superior guitar at about the same price.

(Absolutely no compensation was given from Schecter or Rondo music - I just happen to like their products and wanted to share some advice to make the world a better place!)

Hope I was able to help you out, good luck with all your guitar endeavors in the future :)

2381,381,6113,"This case was bought for my Epiphone Les Paul Black Beauty 3 which fits inside pretty well, although there is a little wiggle room. The case appears to be built well, however, the case lid is misaligned with the base section when closed shut. The lid should overlap the bottom case similar to how a shoe box lid fits on top of its box. The misalignment creates an odd gap which is only noticeable upon close inspection. I have a similar Epiphone case for my Sheraton and that case closes properly like my shoe box example. So beware production quality may not be consistant and could vary on a case to case basis (I couldn't resist that pun).

Also, I feel my guitar should fit more snugly inside the case similar to how my Gretsch G5120 Electromatic fits inside its Gretsch G6241FT Flat Top case. My Gretsch G5120 has a snug (almost tight) fit inside its G6241FT case which allows absolutely no wiggle room.

2401,401,9393,I had to send this back. Its a great concept but not well thought out. When you put your mic system in it fits snug with the foam pads. If you plan on using the short antennas then you can leave them on the unit. I use the range extension antennas that are longer and they won't fit unless you remove and put on each time you use. The other issue I have with this design is that when you unzip you can't completely remove the ends of the case. So when you are using there really isn't a good way to have it set on table. With a little adjustment on design this would be a really cool simple case to have. Unfortunately it didn't  work for me. I'm a huge fan of Gator products too. Hope this helps!,music

2410,410,7363,"I currenty use two types of capos - the Kyser one and Shubb capos.  Both are the most popular capos around but have different strengths and weaknesses.

The benefits of the Kyser is that it is the quickest changing capo I've come across, doesn't require tension adjustment, and can clip to the end of the headstock when not in use.  The primary benefit of the Shubb is that it has adjustable tension (and second, it's smaller).

The main drawback of the Kyser is the lack of adjustable tension.  Because it's designed to work across the fretboard, it will apply more force than necessary to clamp down the lower frets, causing frets to wear faster over time.  Because of this I prefer to use the Kyser on my less expensive guitar and the Shubbs on the guitar I baby.",music

2415,415,5355,I was a little skeptical about purchasing this mount. I read reviews where it snapped. Well I'll tell you I've was very carefull putting it on the first time. But when I figured out how easy it went on I try it in different places on my drums and each time it got easyer. In fact I ordered 3 more. They are a little pricey . But the material they use is very forgiving if you put it on the way the instructions shows. Just don't force it to much. It all so doesn't interfere with the drum head rim. I recommend this mount.,music
2416,416,6588,I've owned the same one for 10 years and it's still going strong after many gigs. The spring tension is just right.,music

I've still got 2 solid black ones and a ""drop d"" capo from kyser. I bought one as a backup, which I will never probably need...these capos just last...the spring, the rubber...it's all still holding up 12 years after i bought them. Now...why did I buy this one? BECAUSE IT'S BEAUTIFUL.....Same great  quality, but this rosewood version is just great, pops on stage and matches on of my guitar's finish perfectly. So, if you are in the market for a capo, grab a quality one from Kyser...if you want one that also makes your fellow musician friends jealous, grab the rosewood finish. Thanks to Kyser for the ""if it ain't broke"" approach to the function, but continuing to create new products we desire!!",music

Depending on how you use it and treat it, it will last you a long time but the pad will eventually wear out on you. Personally, I never leave mine clipped on my guitar when not in use for long periods of time since I believe it weakens the tension. Great product and quality over all. It hasn't let me down. There is not tension adjustment, which I would have to say is a negative. A Capo does have the ability to wear on your frets over time if you constantly use it and you don't have tension adjustment.",music

This is great for a guitar with an odd shaped bottom that won't sit well on those other stands. Also, the lack of that bottom piece is one less thing for your strap to get tangled up in when you need to change an instrument quickly. This stand is also tall enough for larger instruments like basses and acoustic guitars.

Sturdy enough for stage but they do take up more space than some other stands because the legs open nice and wide for more stability. They fold up compactly but are still a bit heavy to carry around and won't fit in your gig bag it that's what you need.

Second, if they do decide to stick with playing guitar and eventually own a ""better"" or more high end guitar, Mexican made teles or strats are great back up guitars for stage use. I have a couple different high end guitars and I will not get rid of my Mexy Strat because it sounds great still. I'll never pick up my first guitar which is essentially this.",music

2448,448,5912,"This pedal has managed to become the one and only delay on my board due to its sheer girth and amazing versatility.  The tone is very complementing to my desire for pristine cleans(as it does not break cause a lot of break up) and I love having the option of the tap tempo and 15 varieties of delays from vintage to modern. I returned the Boss DD20 which for me left a lot to be desired (due to its very flat sounds--many of the tones where indiscernible), for this wonder green pedal and so far I am quite satisfied.  I noticed on the feed back that everyone loves the loop option--a very stunning feature!
Another issue that caught my attention was the controversy of this pedal is the charging requirements:12vAC (which is hard to get if you are running an all DC power brick).  Many individuals say that they hate using the power supply or C batteries, well my answer to them is either 1) by the charger or 2) get a T-rex Chameleon fuel tank, (which has a 12vAC option and a special cable, designated for the Line 6 DL4 and many other Line 6 models. I know this is an expensive option but the T-rex chameleon fuel tank is very useful piece of equipment that will power most all of your effects which means you can kiss those boxes of batteries goodbye.  It also helps kill the very annoying buzz that ensues when too many units are running at the same time through your signal).
The price is a bit steep but if you are like me--an individual after that tone that says ""this is me,"" then don't be scared of the price tag!

p.s. I realize that I went off on a T-Rex chameleon tangent for a good half of this review, just passionate about both devices.",music

2452,452,5319,"These are good, aestethically might not be the best for everyone, since there after installation, there remains a significative gap between the button and the mechanism on the strap. Two elements before installation:

1) Don't try, as I did, to test if the original screws are ""compatible"" with this button. I wanted to see if the original screws held the button, and they are generally shorter than the ones required by this system. To my surprise, when I tried to extract the screw, its somewhat bigger head embedded itself into the button and could not get out easily. I eventually did without damage.

2) As someone recommended, be sure that the provided screw fits easily into the guitar's original hole. If it doesn't, the screw's figure will be deformed, since it seems to be a fairly soft material. At the moment you feel any strong resistance, you better go back and carefully try to widen the hole. It wouldn't be a good thing if you are stuck with a strap button only halfway inserted, and with a busted screw that you will not be able to easily get out.

2458,458,9768,"The MD-2 Mega Distortion was not released by BOSS until September 2001.  By that time, the grunge, detuned, and seven-string culture BOSS was trying to cater to was already starting to die out, and experienced players had well-set impression of what a BOSS distortion sounded like - largely from the venerable, yet flawed DS-1 Distortion.

But a funny thing happened when I plugged in the MD-2 Mega Distortion: it actually kinda rocks!  While the tone of this pedal probably isn't a complete reinvention of the DS-1, the ""bottom"" control gives it considerably more bass.  In fact, this might be the only BOSS distortion pedal that gives you the low end control of a MT-2 Metal Zone without getting stuck into the niche tone of a ""metal"" pedal.  While pedals like the MI Audio Crunch Box, Marshall Guv'nor, and others are referred to as ""Marshall-in-a-box"" pedals, the MD-2 actually does a brilliant job on smaller combo amps of simulating the ""whomp"" of a large cabinet pushing air with bass notes.

Also, there's a very cool interplay going on between the ""Distortion"" knob and the ""Gain Boost"" knob.  Turning up only the Gain Boost actually creates a more vintage/overdriven sound.  It's punchy, but not super saturated.  The Distortion knob seems to dial in the more saturated heavy gain settings targeting nu metal and other modern players.  But neither of those options sound ""metal"" - this is a rock pedal through and through.

It may look like a DS-1, but the MD-2 really is its own beast, and I like it.  Some people may prefer the more fashionable ST-2 Power Stack, but I think the MD-2 is underappreciated, especially for bedroom/casual players who want some thickness to their tone.",music

While the 10 may have some features that are better than the 3, I cannot discern them. As a notable downside, the recording level at the same gain setting in the H1 for the 10 is just far lower.  I am planning to use the lapel mic system with the Zoom H1 when I give talks that I want to record my voice in a consistent manner rather than having the zoom H1 mic recording from table top. So, I will put the Zoom H1 in my pocket and use the lapel mic. The sound on the ECMCS3 seems really superb to me, and the sound level is so much lower on the 10 that I think it's inadequate.

2466,466,6502,"From Greg Abrams review, entitled ""For all but the tone snobs,"" a review further down on this product's page:

""Alright, so you want to get a good (if somewhat ""basic"") distortion sound for less than $100? This is your deal.""

I strongly disagree.  You can find MUCH BETTER distortions for $100 or less, even a few near or under the $40 mark the DS-1 is currently priced at.

I've played guitar for over 10 years.  Like many people one of my first pedal purchases was the DS-1.  Afterall, everyone talks about them, they're available at any given music store in the nation, you hear about all these famous musicians using them, plus a DS-1 is actually pretty cheap!  So I snapped one up just like everyone else.  Come to find out that just because something is POPULAR, that doesn't always mean its GOOD (see: Nickelback, the Transformers movie franchise, the Kardashian family, etc...).

So I plugged it in and didn't really care for it.  The distortion was harsh, thin, artificial sounding and always noisy.  I tried it on both my amps (My practic amp: a solid state Fender Frontman 25R, and my big amp, the B-52 AT100, which is a 100w tube halfstack) It was was not very diverse, and the basic sound was not very likeable to me.  I've read the Japanese made DS-1's are better in sound than the newer, made in Taiwan models but, either way, the DS-1 is just not a great pedal in my mind.

But, like many newer players, I didn't know any better at the time.  Fast forward a few years and I've bought and sold literally dozens of pedals.  There is a whole world of great tones to be found out there if you keep your eyes open.

So here are some pedals I currently own that I like much better than the DS-1.  All of them are great general purpose distortions, easy enough to find new and used in most guitar shops, and can, at the time of this writing, be bought brand new for $75 or less here on good ol' Amazon.com, and are rugged enough to last for years:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boss-DS-2-Turbo-Distortion/dp/B0002CZV8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boss DS-2 Turbo Distortion</a>:  Lest I catch any flames from people thinking I'm a Boss hater (I'm certainly not, I loved the TU-3, the ODB-3, the MD-2, and the XT-2, among others) I'll start with the DS-1's big brother.  This pedal has a much nicer tone to it, not to mention 2 distinct distortion modes.  The I setting is pretty much a higher quality DS-1, the II setting is a brighter, richer tone.  As the DS-1 completely overshadows the DS-2 in popularity, you can find DS-2's all over ebay for very cheap prices.  A very worthy pedal, unfortunately overlooked by many.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pro-Co-RAT2/dp/B0002MSQVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pro Co RAT2</a>:  Great dirty distortion pedal.  Probably my personal favorite.  You've heard this box used on literally hundreds if not thousands of songs in the last 30 years, its used by just a ridiculous amount of guitarists.  Its a rich, full distortion that at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy.  I've never heard a bad tone out of mine. Its great for getting a ""big amp"" kind of sound out of a small practice amp.  Its also great for pushing a big amp with too much headroom into the overdriven sweet spot without having to crank the amp volume.  A truly excellent pedal.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/EHX-Little-Big-Muff/dp/B000T517Y4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">EHX Little Big Muff</a>:  The Big Muff is another pedal you've heard on hundreds of songs.  Its kind of a fuzz, kind of a distortion, but definitely owns its own sonic territory.  Very big, saturated and warm.  Used heavily in the 70's for classic rock tones, also in the 90's and beyond for tons of grunge and garage.  Used by everyone from Carlos Santana and David Gilmour to the Smashing Pumpkins, Dinosaur Jr. and Jack White.  I personally reccomend the Little Big Muff, not only is it a touch creamier in tone than the recent NYC reissue, its smaller, uses a regular 9v adapter and its CHEAPER!  A great pedal.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MXR-Distortion/dp/B0002E520C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MXR Distortion +</a>:  The Distortion + is a great first distortion, and can usually be found pretty cheap.  Whats nice about the Distortion + is that it sounds great on anything, and the lack of a tone knob helps keep it somewhat transparent, i.e. you can more easily hear the natural tone of your guitar and amp, it doesn't cover over your equipments sound.  Used by quite a few famous folks, including the Greatful Deads Jerry Garcia, Randy Rhoads (Ozzy's famous guitarist) and Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Danelectro-CM-1-Cool-Cat-Metal/dp/B000A40NAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Danelectro CM-1 Cool Cat Metal</a>:  Make sure you get the Cool Cat Metal, NOT the Metal II.  That's a fine pedal as well, but its definitely more of a traditional metal pedal.  The Cool Cat Metal, or CM-1, is actually a very very different pedal from most metal pedals.  Basically, its a pre-amp that sits on the floor.  It has a fully adjustable EQ with tons of volume and gain through the roof.  So you can do anything from a clean boost (with the gain at minimum there is virtually NO coloration to your tone) to high gain metal stuff, with plenty of great overdrive and rock tones in between.  It works well with any amp I've tried it on, and you can find tons of great sounds.  Its an unbelievably versatile pedal, and its even true bypass.  The best part is, Danelectro seems to have made way too many of them, so you can easily find one used or even new for under $30.  A true hidden gem that's actually CHEAPER than a DS-1.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joyo-JF-03-Crunch-Distortion/dp/B005LYIW3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joyo JF-03 Crunch Distortion</a>:  This little guy surprised me.  Its supposedly a clone of the MI Audio Crunch Box, and, if so, that must be one awesome pedal too.  Its essentially a Marshall stack in a box, and boy does it ever succeed at that.  Great crunch, tons of volume and gain, it really can make your practice amp sound like a big ragin' stack!  It even sounded good going into my modeling amp (very few pedals work well with my modeling amp, and this one even sounded better than the Marshall simualtion built in), and you can get a brand new one for $40 shipped, fantastic!

Speaking of Joyo, I've had a few of their pedals as well as one or two from MOEN, another Chinese pedal maker, and I'm honestly floored by how nice they sound given their shockingly low price tag (especially the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MOEN-MO-FM-Fuzz-Moo/dp/B007L5PVI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MOEN MO-FM Fuzz Moo</a>&nbsp;which honestly out Big Muffs every Big Muff I've ever played through).  So JOYO and MOEN, they both make a variety of great sounding fuzz, od, and dirt pedals, check them out (and before anyone gets all up in arms about supporting a Chinese company, please keep in mind that NONE of the pedals listed in my review, DS-1 included, are made in America, let alone the western hemisphere).

Hopefully these suggestions give you something to look for.  Also, if you can't actually try a pedal out at the store, YouTube is great place to hear demos of what different pedals can do.

I should also mention that if you try and love the DS-1 and it suits your needs, than more power to you.  Tone is subjective, every pedal sounds different running through different guitars and amps, and just because I may share different opinions on something that you love, that's okay.  My main reason for posting this lengthy review is to give newer players some information.  You have PLENTY of options for distortion pedals, the DS-1 is NOT the only thing out there that's affordable.  Find something you truly love and buy that.  If its the DS-1, one of the pedals I've mentioned here, or anything else, the important part is that it sounds right to YOU.",music

2472,472,2121,"When comparing the Sennheiser e 835 to the popular SM58, it's a better microphone in most situations. The pickup pattern is tighter and the frequency response is fuller. It probably has the ability to handle a higher sound pressure level also, but most won't care about that.

The pickup pattern is so tight that you will usually want to be within an inch of the windscreen, but this is why you won't get feedback as easily from it. Well, you know how you have to work the mic to adjust for louder and softer, now you'll just be working it at a closer distance, just remember to roll off the lows to reduce the proximity effect. But this is probably just it's biggest benefit of many, although it also makes it a bad choice for using one mic in front of three singers.

This microphone speaks of quality and durability in your hand, it's solid and heavy. The handling noise is excellent for those of you using this as a hand held microphone, it's quiet. It's frequency response drops down to 40Hz, making it an excellent choice for an instrument mic also. This will do a good job on close up work with guitar cabs to brass, providing excellent rejection of other sounds, The bottom of a snare or anyplace that you want a high rejection ratio, and can also fit this size of microphone.

So for those of you looking for it double as a recording microphone, because where you are recording has a high noise floor, it will work out well also. Being a studio owner, I suggest the quietest possible place to record and a low noise floor, but I know that it's not always possible. It will do a great job of rejecting other sound and focusing on what it's in front of.

You'll get a good clip and an average carry bag with it.

take up the uke has been a Godsend to me!...why?....it simply occupies my fragile brain!...at 80, ya gotta keep busy son!!...

And, yes, I did check out wether I could get enough amplification by just playing into the mic with no
additiional amplification, and many of the experts I talked to said, yes, I could do that and it would
work out fine.

So, since that does not do ""diddle squat"" for any amplification, I now have to actually amplify
my ukulele, which will cost me, God Only Knows!...
