This is musically complex punk with a lot of influences and a lot of tight playing and gripping tunes.\n\nThis is an awesome concert. The only two problems are that 1) it is just 67 minutes long and 2) John Doe's bass is buried too deep in the mix.\n\nEvery X fan should get this. More importantly, anyone who doesn't know about X should get this.\n\nWhy X? Did you know, for example, that:\n- X has a different sound based on the unique harmonies between co-lead singers Exene Cervenka and John Doe that really sets them apart from anything else out there?\n- Doe, Cervenka and drummer DJ Bonebrake also play in the country punk band The Knitters?\n- Billy Zoom, the guitarist who originally formed the band, used to play rockabilly guitar for Gene Vincent and other big stars, and has been voted one of the greatest guitar players ever by Guitar Player magazine?\n- X were playing Leadbelly tunes way before Kurt Cobain?\n- Ray Manzarek, keyboard player of The Doors, produced X's first four albums? This is one of the big reasons why the band covered and generally closed its concerts with \"Soul Kitchen\" from the album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Doors\/dp\/B000MCIBE8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Doors<\/a>\n- Cervenka and Doe used to be married, before Exene later married Viggo Mortensen -- Aragorn from the Lord of the Rings movies?\n- Billy Zoom left the band from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, but during this time the band still managed to record&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/X-Live-at-the-Whisky-a-Go-Go\/dp\/B000005IRW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">X Live at the Whisky a Go-Go<\/a>, one of the greatest live rock albums ever, with guitarist Tony Gilkyson?\n\nAs this DVD proves, X is still as good as ever. Billy Zoom still plays standing in his trademark splayed-leg stance with a broad grin on his face. Did I say he is awesome? Awesome.\n\nI waited way too long before getting this one, thinking I could do without an X DVD. And I could have. But why should I? This really is worth it, and I'm sure I'll be putting this one in the player more often than a lot of my other music DVDs.

Romeo Void was a disaster due to the tiny outfit Deborah squeezed her huge body into; the audience couldn't stand to look at her even when the music was good. Devo was quite good. Then X came on stage and it was like hearing a great music system play compared to a tinny radio's sound. Man, they were great and they, unlike 99% of the other \"new wave\/punk\" bands of the era were pros.  They had it down and played it up. I loved them! Watching this excellent reunion video (yes, Billy Zoom still has that same perpetual, inane smile on his face while playing), I was surprised to see very much the same show I saw all those years ago, with some extra songs that came out later, that is. The band's still electrifying. I'd like to see them \"live\" again, but until then, this video is the next best thing. It's well filmed and has a great selection of their best songs. Sure, they aren't as \"pretty\" as they used to be, but before you say too much, check your rearview mirror to see how you look now compared to 20 some odd years ago.

His performance is quiet and subdued, not overdone as we might expect from such an intense actor.  I thought Winkler did a great job chaning out of his Fonzie image and taking on the roll of an embittered and lonely miser.\nActually the characters Winkler plays aren't all that different from each other.  Slade felt abandoned and betrayed by those he'd loved, and Fonzie was also abandoned by his parents.  Winkler's parents turned their backs on him when he was a young man because he wanted to be an actor instead of following the family business.  I believe that's why he does rolls like this so well.\nI was quite surprised to find this movie available on DVD and have gladly purchased it to add to my collection of Christmas movies.","summary":"The Fonz as Scrooge","unixReviewTime":1036195200,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

Scott and Albert Finney give detailed performances as Scrooge in their version, and the films that feature them have good production values -- and, in the case of the Finney version a couple of good songs -- but the deviations in text in the Scott version and the added material in the Finney version (Scrooge in hell -- what?) are both unnecessary and more than a little annoying.","summary":"An interesting contrast to more traditional versions","unixReviewTime":1008028800,"vote":31.0,"image":null}

He asked the viewers to let him know what we thought of him in this role as it was different from the ones most had come to know him (eg.  \"The Fonz\").  When I watched it over 30 years ago, I enjoyed it.  It wasn't until recently I sought it out and watched it again.  It is an excellent retelling of the Dicken's classic with an Americanized twist.  The lessons are timeless and Henry Winkler's Mr Slade is really well done and believable.\n\nIf you are fan of a Christmas Carol and have seen many of the cinematic variations and made for TV, this is one you really have to see.","summary":"I enjoyed it.

This version stars Henry Winkler as Scrooge and takes place during the Depression in America.  Winkler plays Scrooge as a business owner who offers home furnishings to be paid off over time.  But most people can,t pay off the entire bill due to job scarcity - etc- and Winkler ends up repossessing much of what he has \"sold\".  Soon \"ghosts\"- ( passed aquaintances in this version)- of Chistmas past, present, and future appear taking Winkler back through time and into the future showing him his past and what the future holds in store for one of his \"value system\" ,  Winkler realizes that he best become more kinder and more considerate of the needs of his town neighbors or risk dying a lonely and embittered man.

An excellent and original adaption.\n\nAn American Christmas Carol is a superb and original adaption of the Dickens Christmas classic. Henry Wrinkler stars as the Scrooge character, Benedict Slade. He does a great job as a hardnosed old man, and he does look convincing in aged make up. The story takes place in New England America, during the Great Depression.\n-An American Christmas Carol is unique in many ways. Slade doesn't believe he's evil or even a miser; he's just a practical businessman. On Christmas Eve he and his employee, Thatcher, go out in their truck to repossess items - to take back what is rightly his, Slade says. When carolers show up at Slade's door, he doesn't chase them away with a stick like Scrooge did, he congratulates them on their wonderful singing and offers them a present: A small book he printed up at his own expense on how to save money and make yourself a future.\n-Slade's deceased business partner Jack Latham appears and he offers some stunning quotes.\n\n\"Hell isn't what you think it is, devils with pitchforks, fire and brimstone.\"\n\"Thank God,\" Slade responds.\n\"It's worse,\" Latham says.\n\nA short while later Slade says \"But you were a man of business, Latham. You drove a hard bargain but you never did anything evil!\"\n\"Evil isn't just what you do,\" Latham replies, \"It's also what you DON'T do.\"\n\nA wonderful sentiment. The whole movie is full of incredible quotes and comments on generosity, history, a man's life, and a man's effect on the people and world around him.\n-As a unique feature I've never seen in any other adaption, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are played by Slade's customers, the very people he just repossessed items from. Slade actually believes them to be the same people, having broken into his warehouse. Until they provide a sample of their supernatural powers. The spirits are heralded by Slade's old radio broadcasting music and news from either the past or the future, even when it's unplugged.\n-Another unique thing is once Slade has seen the light and transformed into a better man, he is still a bit of a grump. As if the transformation isn't instantaneous and is still a work in progress. He is more generous, more concerned with the welfare of others, including the town, the unemployed, his employee Thatcher and his sick son, the orphanage where he once stayed at, but he has a very nice and realistic bite to him yet.\n-The movie comments on the Dickens work frequently. \"Did you read that book, Mister Slade?\" a bookseller asks, after Slade has reformed.\n\"The ghost of hell? The ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future? Complete and utter ... what was the word he used?\"\n\"Humbug?\"","summary":"Original, Amrerican, Thought Provoking and Unique","unixReviewTime":1224892800,"vote":null,"image":null}

A Christmas Carol is a yearly read for me (at least once) and the Patrick Stewart version, being well-casted and closest to the book text, is also a yearly event, for me.  I also like the George C. Scott version, however, with reservations as other reviews mentioned - the annoying changes on some of the key points of the story.  That is to give you an idea where I am coming from with this version.  The title describes what you're getting - the Christmas Carol story with an American flavor.  Henry Winkler is excellent and, considering the time in which this was made, the production value is fairly good!!  Dorian Harewood is my favorite of the three \"ghosts\" who visit him and (SPOILER ALERT) I like the twist of having the visiting ghosts be the same people he was mistreating.  Depression-era America doesn't have nearly the \"romantic\" quality that Victorian England does, but it works well with the story.

Jamele","reviewText":"I loved this film when it was on tv when I was in High School; seeing it on DVD was an enjoyable experience, but I found an annoying problem in continuity: Winkler's character seems to be growing up in the 1890s, which is fine, but at one point we see him at a WWI War Bond Rally, and he seems to be in his early-thirties.  Yet just fifteen years later, during the Great Depression, he's a very old man.  So what's the deal?  It seems as if the film's producers just happened to have a few WWI-era cars and costumes and posters hanging around, so they decided to twist time around to fit the props.  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense for Winkler's character to be a young boy in what seems to be the early-Industrial Revolution, then a young man during WWI, then a very old man during the Depression.  Very odd.\n\nI have to believe that if they hadn't had some WWI posters and banners and cars available, they would have cut out the War Bond Rally part and kept the continuity intact.  When Slade sees his gravestone, it appears that he was born in 1876- which would make him just over forty in the War Bond scene, and in his mid-fifties in 1933, when the film is supposed to be taking place.  Maybe it's because I'm a history teacher, but this part always bugged me.  Maybe they should have had everyone excited about the Spanish American War of 1898- that would have made a lot more sense, but they would have had to save the scenes with the cars for later. They could have placed the first scene at the end of the Civil War (that would have allowed for some nice props,) making his age in 1933 more believable.  Oh well, great movie.","summary":"Fun, but odd continuity problems","unixReviewTime":1198454400,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

I can't say that I disliked the movie it just doesn't rate up there with the Christmas classics in my estimation and this is simply my own personal take on the film.\n\nIf you're looking for a Christmas movie that the whole family can enjoy together on occasion then this DVD will fit right in, but if you're looking to gather movies for your library that are the so called \"must have Christmas movies\" then pass it up for another title.","summary":"A foible adaptation but not without merit","unixReviewTime":1164412800,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

Winkler was at the height of his popularity when this ABC made for TV movie came out so I'm certain that's why he was cast.  Unfortunately you just can't see anything but Fonzie, even under layers and layers of make-up.\n\nThe scene is shifted from 1840's London to  Depression-era New England, as miserly businessman Slade receives a long-overdue attitude adjustment one Christmas eve when he is visited by three ghostly figures who resemble three of the people whose possessions Slade had seized to collect on unpaid loans. Assuming the roles of the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future from Charles Dickens' classic story, the three apparitions force Slade to face the consequences of his skinflint ways, and he becomes a caring, generous, amiable man.\n\nIn a bit of ridiculousness, the \"Ghost of Christmas Future\" is portrayed by a black man wearing gold chains, dressed in 1979 fashions and listens to disco music. Their \"Ghost of the Future\" jumped a little too far ahead, and is comical by todays standards.\n\nWinkler does an admirable job in his role and Dorian Harewood really shines.  Still...Dickens is a classic...why ABC felt a need to revise something so perfect is beyond me.  This is a good change of pace but if you really like \"A CHristmas Carol\" stick with the Alastair Sim or George C. Scott versions.","summary":"FONZIE PLAYS SCROOGE....AAAYYYYYY!!!!","unixReviewTime":1102377600,"vote":9.0,"image":null}

Martin  Landau as Jacob and Ben Kingsley as Potiphar give their usual first-rate  performances, with the role of Joseph also well-acted.  Leslie-Anne Warren is  the lustful wife of Potiphar, who unsuccessfully tries to seduce Joseph,  and lands him in the Pharoah's prison.  This film offers a very credible  depiction of life in the ancient Near East, from the desert tents of the  Hebrews, to the claustrophobic walled towns like Sichem, to the lushness of  civilized Egypt and the Pharoah's court. The film is faithful to the  Biblical account, and succeeds in making it come alive on the screen.  A  well-acted, well-scripted, and entertaining film.

They did an excellent job of staying true to the story. As you watch this movie you are reminded of the faith AND patience of Joseph. If anyone in history had a reason to throw his hands up and declare that God had forgotten him it was Joseph, yet he remained faithful. The full story is told, even the account of Judah and Tamar which ended up in the birth of the root of the kingly line of Israel. Virtually everything was portrayed and accurately so. To me, the main point they really nailed was how Joseph woke up one day, still a prisoner, and by sunset he was the second most powerful man on the face of the Earth. This led to another fantastic lesson, Joseph all of a sudden had all the power anyone could want and while today we see people desire power so they can lord it over those beneath them and settle old scores, Joseph instead showed compassion. He could have easily destroyed his brothers or a least made them suffer as he had suffered but instead he displayed true character.... a lesson many in positions of power today could learn from. The story of Joseph is one of the most remarkable in Biblical history and rightly so.\nYou can spend your hard earned dollars with confidence when you buy this movie and you will want to either loan it to others or buy it for them as a gift. It's too bad that more movies of this quality are made, especially when you consider all the technology that is available.","summary":"One of the best Biblical movies ever made!","unixReviewTime":1436572800,"vote":null,"image":null}

As Joseph he is a truly unharnessed character whose angst is so deep, visually apparent and so complete that we are free to empathize with him. The multi dimensional emotional conflict from within the character is so palpable that it\ndevelops its own spiritual presence in the hot tub seduction scene.  And, the gentle, sweet, forgiving demeanor of Joseph when he reveals\nhimself to his brothers at the end just ties the story together and brings it to a close with an all encompassing forceful power that is just so\nrefreshing.  No violence, no revenge, just powerful forgiveness mixed with a dash of gratitude for the end resulting exalted \/ elevated status\nthat resulted from his brothers' betrayal.  I love using this movie to learn languages.  The layered emotion and richness makes it, for me, a movie classic.  I think Paul Mercurio movies in general are great language learning tools.  They are so interesting that I don't mind watching them many times.  And, watching anything more than once is a rare occurrence for me.  I initially saw this movie on a religious channel so\nthe hot tub scene was edited out due to its sexy content.

It stars Paul Mercurio in the title role.\nThis is Biblical, well-acted, and the filmmakers are to be praised for the sound Biblical research. Although some of the sexually explicit scenes,it should be screened from the very young. It is an ideal platform from which teens can search out characteristics of moral uprightness in Joseph. The performances were great. Mercurio does an admirable job. The only flaw I could find in it is that it isn't powerful as other Biblical films and TV movies.

{"overall":5,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"09 3, 2014","reviewerID":"A3FS7RSDQ7JSWC","asin":"0005119367","style":{"Format:":" DVD"},"reviewerName":"Nina Kish","reviewText":"This epic, motion picture - JOSEPH, starring Actor: Paul Mercurio in the title role, is an engaging, true life, biblical drama straight from the Old Testament\/Book of Genesis within the Holy Bible (See Genesis 30:22-24; 37:1-36 & 39:1-50:26). Written for television by: Lionel Chetwynd, this 1995 film which also features... not one, but two Academy Award winning Actors: Sir Ben Kingsley as 'Potiphar' and Martin Landau as 'Jacob', also won the prestigious Emmy Award for: \"Outstanding Miniseries.\" And, although it focuses on the life of JOSEPH, it also chronicles the latter life of his father Jacob, together with his wives, his concubines, his only sister - Dinah, and the lives of his brothers, as well. From the popular \"Bible Collection\" Films of which (at this date), there are 13 available, Turner Pictures presents a Lube Production in association with Lux Beta Films and Rai Uno in presenting this disturbing yet deeply moving and climactic film: JOSEPH, in it's entirety. All, 187-minutes of it. This compelling, motion picture\/miniseries, vividly depicts the willful, calculated and brutal betrayal of 17-year old JOSEPH, the 11th son of 12 brothers. Who, was maliciously sold into slavery, to appease their jealousy of him. What are older brothers for, eh?! So why..., were they so cruel and viciously envious of JOSEPH? Because he was their father's obvious favorite (Genesis 37:3-4). Sibling rivalry? Oh yeah! And, then some!! In viewing this captivating drama, one cannot help but wonder..., how it helped JOSEPH's brother's to be so jealous of him? And what did they hope to accomplish with their continued envy, scorn and contempt towards their innocent, younger brother? It certainly wasn't going to change their father's love for him. Neither, would it change the fact, that JOSEPH was the long awaited, first-born son of Jacob's favorite wife, Rachel. Nor would it diminish their feelings of paternal rejection, deep seated inadequacies and personal insecurities from which, acute jealousy, stems. But, aside from his younger brother Benjamin, his only sibling by the same mother (Rachel), the 10 older brothers and their level of jealousy towards him escalated too such a fever pitch, that initially they literally plotted to murder JOSEPH. But, due to the sanity and shrewdness of the one brother, they opted to throw him into a cold, dry, well, complete with snakes. The following morning, they literally sold him..., to Ishmaelite Slave Traders for 20 pieces of silver. Talk about betrayal, treachery, deviousness, jealousy and abject hatred! Again, was there any brotherly love, here? No way! And, they all made a profit from literally..., selling out his person. So how, did their acute jealousy help anything? It didn't. From the on-set, jealousy of another breeds resentment and hostility. Unbridled, it only suffices to kill and destroy. In this particular case, blatant deceit combined with needless treachery together with their murderous envy, sheer hatred and concealment of their vile crime, manifested itself in a heinous betrayal against their own brother. And, as if that weren't enough, they further added insult to injury by deliberately lying too their father, Jacob. How? By corporately telling him the tale, that JOSEPH was dead and gone. Because he supposedly, was killed by a wild animal. And, they 'offered' his blood stained coat which Jacob had made for him, as \"proof.\" Meanwhile, JOSEPH... who was very much alive, was re-sold in Egypt by the Ishmaelite Slave Traders, to Potiphar - the Captain of the Pharaoh's Guard. So, as far as the envious brother's were concerned, JOSEPH was seemingly out of the picture and doomed to the wretched existence of a slave. And for years, such was the case. And Jacob, having lost his favorite son, along with his pride and joy upon whom all of his hopes of leading the family clan were founded, continued to grieve for his thought to be dead, son. Because when you truly love someone, their absence only makes the heart grow fonder. The years wore on..., and JOSEPH grew to become very handsome. He was a man of excellence and integrity, who knew how to read and write (most slaves didn't), and one who carried himself in a humble manner. As was pleasing to his master, Potiphar. However, for as much as Potiphar trusted JOSEPH... to the point that he elevated him to be his personal assistant and household accountant, so too, did Potiphar's' promiscuous wife (as portrayed by Actress: Lesley Ann Warren) decide, that she would take advantage of the situation and use JOSEPH's strong, attractive, physique for her own sexual pleasure. But, there was only one problem. JOSEPH refused to sleep with her. And she, incensed at having her advances rejected by a mere slave, spitefully and vindictively accused him of a most heinous crime. Rape. (Yup! All of this..., sex and all, is really within the Holy Bible. And, at the beginning of this review, you were provided with: Chapter, scripture and verse(s), so you can read it for yourself). So, what happened to JOSEPH? Well, having heard that his wife was supposedly raped, Potiphar stripped JOSEPH of his position and status, and further placed him into Pharaoh's prison. Where common thieves, cut throat's and all sorts of criminals are kept. Hardly the place, for an innocent and educated man, like JOSEPH. A man of breeding and integrity. However, just as Potiphar was impressed with the way JOSEPH carried himself and handled his assigned duties, so too, was the prison warden into whose prison care, JOSEPH was placed. To the point, that he elevated JOSEPH to the position of prison overseer, who was in charge of all the other prisoners. Years went by, and then came the fateful day when two of Pharaoh's employee's - a wine bearer and a baker, were placed into prison under JOSEPH's care. Utilizing his gift that the Lord had given to him (that of interpreting dreams), JOSEPH correctly foretold the dreams of both, the baker and the wine bearer. Specifically, that the wine bearer would be reinstated into Pharaoh's employ and that the baker would die in prison. It came to pass just as JOSEPH had stated, and having been restored, the wine bearer remembered and told Pharaoh about JOSEPH, when Pharaoh's' court see's could not interpret Pharaoh's dreams. JOSEPH was summoned to Pharaoh's Court and after hearing and accurately predicting the dreams of the Pharaoh, he was rewarded and promoted to the position of Governor of all, Egypt. Second only, to Pharaoh himself. Believe it! And what, became of JOSEPH's brother's? Well, suffice it to say, that the rest of this powerful drama is a story of forgiveness, healing, reconciliation and restoration. And yes, JOSEPH's brother's got a lesson that they wouldn't soon forget! This is a deeply moving, epic, biblical drama that comes to it's audience in color, on a single-disc, DVD in spoken English in 4.0 Dolby Digital Surround Sound and also, in 2.0 Dolby Digital Spanish. With subtitles in English, Spanish and French. And shows in full screen format for approximately 187-minutes. To say the least, it is a very interesting motion picture that does much more, than just entertain. It deals with human drama in relation too the God, that created..., mankind (See Genesis 1:2-28 & 2:21-25). Nina Kish","summary":"Initially, bound and betrayed.

One word of caution, the scene where Potifar's wife tries to seduce Joseph while bathing is extremely steamy & sexual.

I'm a pastor.  Great acting; great story telling.  Pretty good regarding Biblical faithfulness.  The theology in this has nothing objectionable, and I'm a stickler on getting theology right, since that's my job.  Even the extra-Biblical stuff that's in the movie is not Biblically-off.  Great theological themes pervade the movie.  Like someone else said, I could've done without the bath scene.  There's no nudity in it, and something like this might have happened, sure; but it makes me unable to hand the DVD over to my younger daughters.  I always have to watch this with them and flip by that scene when it comes up.  Don't let that deter you from buying this, though.  This is in the series done by Ted Turner.

This is a very Biblically accurate version of the Joseph story, not changing the Biblical story but rather developing it.  (For example, in this version, Potiphar believes Joseph is innocent of immorality with his wife, and Joseph tells him about his past as a flashback, not found in the Bible.)  The massacre at Shechem in Genesis 34 is included and shows what rotten people some of Joseph's brothers were.  The actors for the brothers do very well demonstrating individuality but also a group mentality, and they show powerful character change by the end.  It's interesting that the movie shows the brothers have really changed just by showing their eager attitude in blessing the name of God with their father Jacob (\"Blessed be His name\")!  The actor for Jacob does very well, too.  (The actor for Joseph is fine, too, but the character couldn't have too much personality, because every viewer has a preconceived expectation of what he should be like.)  The movie introduced me to an interesting idea, which is that Jacob may have been involved in preserving genealogies and stories from Abraham.  The Book of Genesis does have a much more continuous account of Jacob's life, whereas stories of Abraham's life are like disconnected snapshots.  So what I got most out of this movie was the interesting idea that the Book of Genesis was recorded before Moses' time.","summary":"Stimulating","unixReviewTime":1322870400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Burton","reviewText":"There are no words accurate enough to praise this enthralling television miniseries.  \"Joseph\" is one of the most fascinating of biblical accounts, and I will not rehash the plot since it is done superbly by other reviewers here.  I will simply say that this timeless true account of a faithful and courageous young man is a wonderful tool to use with teenagers.  Satan has planted so much filth in the movie industry, and I praise God that there are filmmakers who still desire to present the truth.  \"Joseph\" presents a magnificent story of forgiveness and integrity that all teenagers can learn from.\n\nThis miniseries is one of the best biblical retellings in film fashion I've ever come across.  The story grabs you from the very beginning and is never dull.  Paul Mercurio is excellent in his portrayal of Joseph, presenting a teenager and young man with exceptional character.  Mercurio brings a vulnerability to this man that endeared him to me at once.  The scene where he cries for mercy after his brothers' betrayal moved me to tears.  Joseph struggles with temptations and is flawed like us all.  Ben Kingsley is excellent as Potipher, portraying a man of integrity and care.  The actors portraying Joseph's brothers are equally excellent.\n\nSeveral reviewers have complained about the scene with Joseph and Potipher's wife, a femme fatale portrayed with unabashed glee by Leslie Ann Warren.  This scene is sexually charged, but I believe it is accurate with Scripture.  The Bible doesn't sugarcoat things, nor should we think the Bible hereos were not susceptible to temptation.  Although God never reveals if Potipher's wife was a temptation to Joseph, I logically don't see how she could not have ben.  He was, after all, seventeen when the attempted seduction took place.  Wouldn't any of us struggle in this area at this age? Besides, seeing Joseph struggle makes the viewer empathize with his predicament.  Anyway, I say this only to encourage you not to let this one scene put you off.  Please give this wonderful film a chance.  Happy viewing, and God bless you.","summary":"Magnificent!

Murphy","reviewText":"This film is closer to the Biblical text of this account, than any we've yet seen....it's very emotional and very encouraging as well.  Long film, but not too long!  The only real problem (meaning unacceptable) is the bath-tub scene with Joseph.  He's seen from waist up, in a pool relazing\/bathing, and in comes his boss's wife who's been after him sexually.  Potiphar's wife seductively rubs up and down his chest, until (WITH MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS GOING ALONG WITH THE SEDUCTIVITY) she goes down into the water below his waist and connects with his genitals (yes, for real).  Both Joseph and her are shown to react to the moment ever so....\"slightly\" and then she leaves him alone until the next time she confronts him.  We had this film for YEARS and thought how awesomely Biblical (compared to any other film) this movie was, but never noticed this part until this year.  Why?  because we had younger children at the time, and so the inferred sexual tension of her rubbing his shoulders over the bath-tub\/pool was something we'd simply pass by w\/ the fast-fwd button a mere several seconds.  We didn't do that this year, and WHOOOAH!!  We were SHOCKED at what transpired in those few moments.  They don't show below the water, but they PLAY UP the moment big time to let you know what is happening.  For this reason, i say DON'T BUY THE MOVIE unless you can edit it.  If i had this film on VCR, i'd simply tab the \"edit\" tab on the VCR tape and i'd record a whole minute or two over that one moment (which wouldn't hurt a 3-plus hour long film!).\n\nIt's truly a shame that the film makers snuck in a scene of this degree, they simply could have ended with the woman rubbing Joseph's shoulders in flirtation (showing her constant pursuit of him) and played up the moment that way, at that time.  However, they stuck a little leaven in to satisfy Hollywood and to \"leaven the whole loaf\" with making it clear that she was touching his genitals for a bit and he was helpless to deal with the tempation for a few moments.  This cheap move by the film makers reminds me of the \"Sampson\" film put out by the Bible Collection film makers....which is TOTALLY TRASHY...taking the sexuality way OVERBOARD for the Sampson screen (don't buy it! My family was apalled!).  Again, i say if you cannot edit the movie, DON'T BUY IT.","summary":"if you can edit 1 scene, BUY THIS!","unixReviewTime":1264723200,"vote":20.0,"image":null}

The casting was great (Okay fine, Josephs former master was a white woman, so what? She played her part well I thought). Sexually explicit scenes? Give me a break. There were no sexually explicit scenes. There was a scene of Joseph in the bath being tempted by Potiphar's wife. This is no different from a man\/woman dealing with sexual thoughts\/temptations daily, and that powerful scene would give any Christian in the spirit a visual illustration of the pressure Joseph felt. I especially liked his line when he said to her \"please, you push the limits of my body to more than it can bear.\" The other added scenes did not take anything away from the movie, but gave it dimension. I will take 1 star away only because I do not think that scene where the brother slept with the \"prostitute\" who turned out to be his other brothers wife or whatever was necessary.

There were no sexually explicit scenes in the film. Everything was very \"PG-13\" if not lower. If you call that sexually explicit then you should be censoring Songs of Solomon in the Bible which gives some steamy accounts from Solomon to his \"lover,\" or better yet, you should censor Jesus Christs crucifixion, which was very R-rated (being beaten, flogged, and nailed to a cross seems R-rated to me). Christianity focuses on the heart before appearances so lets all appreciate this great adaptation of Joseph's life.

His intelligence and honest are both a curse to him and a blessing. Through God's favor, and Joseph's steadfastness, he rises to a position of immense power. When his brothers come to him, seeking help, they do not recognize him and the stage is set for either reconciliation or terrible retribution.\n\nThe story is well done and is in keeping with the scriptures.

Joseph is the most loved son of his father, and has a gift for prophecy.  His older brothers hate him because of it and sell him into slavery.  Joseph winds up in Egypt where he eventually becomes the second most powerful man in the kingdom after the Pharoah.  During a famine, Joseph's brothers come to Egypt begging for grain, not knowing that the man who will decide their fate is their brother (whom they believe to be dead).  This is one of a series of made for TV movies about important figures in the Old Testament.  I've previously reviewed several other stories in this series, but this is the best of a strong series in my view.  The acting is top notch, and I found the final confrontation between Joseph and his brothers to be particularly moving and well done.  Like many of the films in this series, it is a story about faith and perserverance.  The writer and producer did a particularly good job of fleshing out the story of Joseph from Genesis without adding lots of non-Biblical threads.  One thing that I like about this movie (and about the series as a whole) is that they are not overdone.  These aren't special effects-laden films with casts of thousands, but rely on writing and good acting to convey the tale.  The sets and the costumes are realistic and give the film a Biblical feel without being ostentatious.  The bottom line is that this is, in my opinion, the way that the Bible should be brought to film.","summary":"Superb dramatization of the Old Testament story of Joseph","unixReviewTime":1172620800,"vote":12.0,"image":null}

There is even a most erotically charged scene or two between Pontiphur's adulteress wife and a scantily clad Joseph. Most everyone already knows the story. Joseph is the favored son of his father, inspiring lethal jealousy from his other sons, Joseph's brothers. They conspire to get rid of Joseph, but can't bring themselves to actually kill him, so they sell him into slavery. He ends up in Egpyt and, over the years, thanks to his talent for explaining the meanings of dreams, rises to a position of power second only to Pharaoh. Circumstances reunite Joseph with his brothers, although they don't know who he is. The revelation of his identity to them and his reunion with his father will touch the heart of anyone who has one!

The only parts that are less than first-rate are the scenes in Pharoah's court; almost campy in costuming and acting, they can provide some amusement in the midst of all the drama. Stefano Dionisi is a most unlikely and modern looking Pharoah, and has the ultimate babe for a wife, the pulchritudinous Monica Bellucci. The entire film though, is always mentally and visually entertaining, and has much spiritual content. As with so much of the Old Testament, there are allegories that run through its narrative that point to the New Testament, and the story of Joseph has much of this symbolism.\nFilmed in Quarzazate, Morocco, with its exotic ancient structures and landscapes, the cinematography by Rafaele Mertes is wonderful; this is a way above average production for television, and a film about a man who \"does nothing against his conscience even on pain of death\" is worth watching again and again.","summary":"a man of character and faith","unixReviewTime":1077321600,"vote":102.0,"image":null}

Only Leslie Ann Warren (Potipher's wife) seems to strain as an actor, nevertheless, her performance detracts little from the drama. Especially capable are the actors portraying Joseph's wicked brothers, with Vincenzo Nicoli sterling is his performance as the wicked Simeon.\nHaving watched the film dozens of times with adults--as well as with my middle-schoolers in the classroom, I can say that the greatest of Bible stories is captured in all its power, pathos, and glory. Although creating a few anachronistic vignettes (such as Joseph's 'foreshadowing' Christ's \"My God, my God...\" speech from the Egyptian prison), the film also captures all of the great ironies of the Joseph story.\nWhen Mercurio tenderly reveals himself as the second most powerful man in the ancient world--to the brothers who hated him as a youth, the words 'I am Joseph' will not fail to bring even the most calloused heart to tears.\nAs my students synthesized the thirty or so characteristics of moral goodness extant in Joseph into an essay, one asked why no such heroes existed today. The question revealed both the effectiveness of this presentation, and the dearth of role models in our society.\n'Joseph' is both gripping in narration, and brilliant its direction. It is faithful to Scripture and well-acted. It is THE finest of the TNT productions to date, of which only one ('Jacob') was a failure.\nEveryone will appreciate this wonderful story of forgiveness, but those those who are looking for the 'hidden things of Christ' cannot miss the poignant messianic threads which are so skillfully woven through the life of Joseph.

Gleeson","reviewText":"This excellent production is without doubt the  best version of the Joseph story that I've ever seen, treating fully and thoughtfully every aspect of this greatest ever \"rags to riches\" tale. It shows very clearly  why Joseph is a truly great hero figure : Firstly, he distinguished himself  by service and respect, to God, to his human master, and to his people (in  that fixed order), putting himself a poor fourth; this contrasts sharply to  many other so-called great men of history who\ndistinguished themselves  through conquest. Secondly, he overcame all of the serious setbacks in his  troubled life, as opposed to most of us, who are overcome by our  disasters.\nThe production is basically very faithful to the Biblical  account, and even tries to explain the more puzzling aspects of the story,  such as Potiphar's ambivalent judgement after the \"rape\", or why  Joseph never sought out his father after he achieved greatness. It also  tries to show the Egyptian\/Hebrew language barrier at times. The  final  parts are somewhat paraphrased, to save running time, but are still  faithful to the essence of the story.\nThe performances of Ben Kingsley  (Potiphar) and Martin Landau (Jacob) are superb, and Paul Mercurio  (Joseph), despite his necessary youth and therefore less experience, does a  good job,  although his \"body language\" often outdoes his spoken  one.\nThere are however a few negatives, such as the below-par sets and  costumes, indicating perhaps a somewhat spartan budget. Also, Joseph's  meteoric rise to governor not only features a poorly type- cast actor for  Pharoh, but would have been far  more plausible if his achievements in  organizing  Potiphar's house and Pharoh's prison were cited. Also, the  distinction between slave and servant \/ commoner is blurred throughout; and  the chronology of the story, with all those periods of \"7 years\",  is not always the most probable one.\nBut overall this is an excellent,  well recommended telling of the story of Joseph the Patriach.","summary":"Joseph (1995)","unixReviewTime":960336000,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

You need 6 1\/2 hours to watch it. But it is well worth the time.\n\nMr. Gibson's \"The Passion\" (2004) was interesting if you want to see just to what extent Jesus suffered.  I also give Mel Gibson credit for underlining that the mass is not only a reenactment of the Last Supper, but it also embodies the sorrowful events of Good Friday and the glorious events of Easter Sunday.  (Though it's far from what I would call a child friendly version.)\n\nThis is a great version if you don't have 6 1\/2 hours to watch the phenomenal \"Jesus of Nazareth,\" or if you don't feel up to the brutal and intense \"The Passion.\"\n\nThis film is kept at a 2 hour length.  But the tradeoff is that the events in the film are ONLY from the \"Gospel According to Luke.\"  That probably won't bother everyone, but I felt obligated to point out that you can't expect the best scenes of all 4 Gospels.\n\nAlright. Onto the subject at hand. The film begins with Mary being visited by the Holy Spirit. Another thing I should point out is that to help keep the film under 2 hours, narration is used to explain the shift from event to event.\n\nI'd rather not go too much into a plot synopsis. If you have read \"Luke,\" you probably already have an idea of what is to follow. I can however say that the film is done with a beautiful style that has dignity and is not overdone. Brian Deacon (Jesus) doesn't play the role with the same intensity that Robert Powell did in \"Jesus of Nazareth.\" But Deacon gives the role a gentle dignity. He gives a real feeling of beauty to the lessons. And while he doesn't have the same fierceness during Jesus' frustrations as Robert Powell did, we can feel his frustration when he gets annoyed.\n\nThe sorrowful Good Friday scenes are certainly nowhere near as brutal as the ones in \"The Passion.\" But we still get the idea of how much Jesus is suffering. And the glorious events of Easter Sunday are beautifully done.\n\nLike I said, if you don't have 6 1\/2 hours to watch the phenomenal \"Jesus of Nazareth,\" and you don't feel quite up to the brutality of 'The Passion,\" this 1979 Brian Deacon film is a perfect alternative.\n\nAnother thing I should point out is that \"The Passion\" is NOT child friendly. \"Jesus of Nazareth\" is in the middle. It's certainly nowhere near the brutality of \"The Passion.\" But 6 1\/2 hours may be too much to show some children. One great thing about this film with Brian Deacon is that it is really child friendly. The lessons are there and drawn accurately from \"Luke.\" And the suffering of Good Friday is there, but not overdone  as in \"The Passion.\"\n\nAnother thing that makes this film good for children is that most of the footage is taken from the simply (but also beautifully) written \"Good News Bible.\"\n\nI like \"Jesus of Nazareth\" and \"The Passion.\" And I can suggest this film as well without reservation.","summary":"Beautiful Masterpiece, Yet Child Friendly Too.","unixReviewTime":1396569600,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

It is based on the Gospel of Luke.  Not every event in the film is in Luke's gospel or vice versa.  But I enjoy this film nonetheless.\n\nIt is filmed in the Holy land and most of the actors are like those you see in that land.  The acting is excellent.  I appreciate that the director allows children to play roles in the movie, for Jesus loved children.  Not like today, where people claim that \"they are for the children\" but then vote for politicians who saddle the children with an unbearable debt.  At the end of giving the parable about the good Samaritan, Jesus asks \"who acted as this man's neighbor?\" and a small child answers.  In Luke's gospel, a grown man answers, however the slight changing of events do not bother me since the message remains the same.\n\nIn the film you will often hear background voices.  For example there is the occasion where a poor old lady deposits two small copper coins into the Temple treasury, since all she had were those two coins.  As she is doing this, you can hear people in the background commenting, in cockneyed accents, \"only a mite?\" \"can't she give more?\" \"it's very little.\"  These sayings are not documented in the gospel but again, do not detract from the message; rather they emphasize our own sinful nature and our need to repent.","summary":"I am writing to you, most excellent Theophilus...","unixReviewTime":1208044800,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

The producers of this movie did painstaking research for many years, and they sought to be accurate in the little details, not only of the clothing and village life, but the ways the people talked and recited the prayers.  The filmmakers sought and succeeded in making a very accurate depiction of the life of Christ as taught in the Holy Bible.\n\nThe Jesus Film has been seen by over 4.7 billion people in 236 nations and thousands of people have accepted Christ as their personal Savior through this remarkable movie.  More people have watched this movie than any other movie in history. It is based on the Gospel of Luke and sticks very closely to the biblical text. (There is very little outside interpretation or extraneous material.)  This is its most valuable asset.  Watching this movie is like taking a picturesque tour of the Gospel of Luke.\n\nBrian Deacon is a charismatic and believable Jesus. He speaks with authority.  He also displays different emotions -- he smiles and treats children with great affection; he is stern toward the religious leaders and hypocrites.  He also displays sadness and grief.  Brian Deacon also looks like a man in his 30's, which Jesus was when He began His earthly ministry after being a carpenter for so many years.\n\nMany of the familiar scenes are depicted in this movie (The Birth, the Baptism, the Teachings, Healings, Trials, Suffering, Death and Resurrection).  There are certain scenes in the Gospel of Luke which are  depicted in this movie which don't appear in other Jesus films except the Gospel of Matthew - Visual Bible (e.g. The Transfiguration,  The healing of the Gadarene demoniac;  Jesus' praying in Gethsemane and sweating drops of blood, then being strengthened by the angel).\n\nWhat is so useful about this movie is that it is dubbed very precisely in so many languages.  This particular DVD features the spoken languages of English, Arabic, French, Japanese, Korean, Portugese, Mandarin (Chinese), and Spanish.  The subtitles are done in English, Spanish, French, Portugese, and Arabic.  If you look at the wonderful behind-the-scenes documentary of how the movie was dubbed, you'll see that they selected trained experts to read the text in the native language and they timed it to the milli-second to make it precisely right.  So, when Jesus speaks, it looks and sounds as if He is speaking the native language.\n\nThere are wonderful Special Features in this DVD:\n\nBesides Direct Scene Access, there is a documentary of Knowing Jesus Personally, where the gospel message is presented and the teachings of Jesus are explained.  There is the Behind-the-Scenes look at how the film was made.  There is also a Tribute to Jesus from people like George Bush, Larry King, David Copperfield, Billy Graham, Mother Theresa, and others.\n\nThere is also a bonus DVD of the story of Jesus for Children.\n\nEven though the acting may not be up to par as Hollywood, they do a good enough job.  The biggest plus of this movie is how faithful it is to the biblical text. An added plus at the end of the film is a complete and clear presentation of the Gospel message.\n\nI bought several copies of this DVD for my friends and church members and they have found it very useful.  I enjoy watching this movie over and over again.  I highly recommend this film, along with \"The Gospel of John.\"","summary":"One of the most accurate depictions on Jesus Christ","unixReviewTime":1175644800,"vote":39.0,"image":null}

An Italian production by the Paulines, with writer\/director Alberto Castellani and cinematographer\/director Giancarlo Cappellano, it takes us through the significant sites in the Holy Land, and also blends in exquisite works of art, from masters like Duccio and his contemporaries, and iconic treasures of Greek and Russian origin.\n\nIt delves into the archeological evidence of the Bible, including the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the many miracles of Jesus, His life as an observant Jew, historical perspectives, and much more. The mixture of music used is also good, and ranges from dramatic melodies to beautiful cantorial singing. This is a 2-sided DVD, with 5 chapters on each side, and is playable in either English or Spanish, and the Spanish narration overall has a better audio quality. It must be noted that the film does not have a Hollywood multi-million $ look, as the color reproduction in the art work is a little off at times, and it is slightly grainy, but not bothersome at all, as the content overrides its flaws. Informative, wonderfully photographed, and occasionally quite moving, this is an excellent addition to anyone's library of Christian films, and will be of interest to those of any faith who wish to learn more about Jesus, and the historical roots of Christianity.

This definitive, rigorously scriptural movie version of the life of Jesus Christ has been seen by over five billion people around the globe, reaching 236 different nations in over 800 languages.  It has helped win innumerable souls to Christ all over the world, and even now, under the aegis of Campus Crusade For Christ, local churches and individuals are coming together in an effort to send a free copy of the movie to every home in the United States.  The movie was a dream over three decades in the making, with five years of pre-production work preceding the seven-month filming that took place in 1978 at a multitude of sites in Israel.  Intense efforts, involving the collaboration of numerous scholars from the whole gamut of Christian churches, went into making Jesus as accurate as it could possibly be - from vintage pottery to historically accurate costuming to sufficient cinders residing behind burning torches, every effort was made to take the audience back to Jesus' time.  It is a non-denominational Christian film; while some churches might quibble about an omission here or a suggestion there, this movie is the story of Jesus and not the story of any particular kind of Christian religion.\nThe movie is based solely on the Gospel of Luke, and the dialogue you hear is taken straight out of the Bible.  Jesus says nothing in this film that He does not say in Luke's account of his life.  Naturally, every facet of Jesus' life could not be covered here, but the movie does a superb job of showing us who Jesus was and how He lived, taught, suffered, and died for the sins of all humanity.  Brian Deacon does a superb job playing Jesus, and Niko Nitai truly shines in his portrayal of Simon Peter.  At times, the film does seem to jump from one scene to another rather quickly, but this goes back to the authenticity upon which the film was founded.  In a sense, Jesus' ministry was spent walking toward Jerusalem and His death on the cross, so we see Jesus and his disciples walking almost continuously; furthermore, Jesus' teachings, as recorded in Luke's Gospel, are a collection of parables and religious instruction originating from many different events in the life of the Savior.  Jesus took His message to the people instead of letting the people come to Him.\nThe suffering of Jesus is handled quite well here, clearly portraying the horrific nature of death by crucifixion without making it disturbing enough to scare young children.  You do see the scourging of Jesus and the driving of the nails into his wrists and feet, but the director seemed to set just the right tone for the scenes.  It all makes for a powerful film that has won innumerable souls across the world; to tell someone of Jesus is one thing, but to show that person in such a captivating format as film exactly who Jesus was and how He suffered and died for the sins of humanity makes for a powerful missionary tool.  Even non-Christians will be impressed by the commitment, scrupulous attention to detail, and cinematic mastery that went into the making of this film.","summary":"The most widely viewed film of all time","unixReviewTime":1083196800,"vote":19.0,"image":null}

As cinema, it's just plain dull; the photography is washed-out (as it was even when the film was new), the zoom lens is overused, and the special effects, minimal as they are, get really cheesy.  Everything is exposition, and it's not terribly competent exposition at that.\nSome continuity gaffes create unintentional hilarity.  For example, when Jesus dips his head in the water for a total-immersion baptism, his hair never seems to get wet.  (This is a miracle we haven't read about, folks.)\nExtras are fun, including a short documentary about the Jesus Film Project, which carts this particular film all around the world as an evangelical tool.  Especially surreal is an hour-long compendium of pious testimonials from such luminaries as George Bush XLI and David Copperfield (huh?).\nThe soft but adequate full-frame transfer on this DVD doesn't leave out any significant information -- I suspect the film was shot open matte.  But many of the compositions are so inept that you'll swear they were cropped at the sides anyway.\nCatholics beware: This film presents a very Protestant-American Jesus, with its emphasis on a \"personal relationship with God\" and other faith concepts that Mother Church could find potentially heretical.  That's no surprise, though, considering that the film was financed by the leader of Campus Crusade for Christ.","summary":"Paved with good intentions","unixReviewTime":1064188800,"vote":17.0,"image":null}

It is a different story, and has nothing to do with the original Frosty TV Special. First of all it is made by a different studio, with different animators, directors, and voices. The director is Bill Melendez, who directed all of the Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and Peanuts specials, so it looks like a Peanuts cartoon. Made in 1992. The voice acting features Jonathon Winters, and it has John Goodman as Frosty. The songs are original and pretty fun. The plot is centered on the folks in town that want clean streets in winter by getting all the snow removed. The kids and Frosty are in a panic and fight back or else they will lose all their snow fun - and snow men. If you approach this show knowing it is not the sequel and is from the team that made the Peanuts shows, you will be OK.\n\nIF YOU ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN THE REAL SEQUEL: The studio that made the first hour long Frosty special that first aired on CBS television in 1969 is Rankin\/Bass Productions, the kings of holiday specials. That show was based on the original song written in 1951 by Steve nelson and Jack Rollins. The studio made a terrific half hour sequel in 1976 for ABC television titled \"Frosty's Winter Wonderland\".  That special starts right where the first one left off.  The basic premise of the story is that Frosty gets a wife named Crystal (played by Shelley Winters), and is sabotaged by the jealous Jack Frost. The character design was by Paul Coker Jr., who did the same work for the first special, so the visual continuity works very well and the characters have that classic Rankin\/Bass 'look'. He also did the unique lettering for the credits in both specials. The famous voice actor Paul Frees stars as Jack Frost, and the policeman. Frees was a regular in studio productions and had also voiced the policeman, ticket seller, and Santa Claus in the original. Jackie Vernon voiced Frosty just like he did before. The writer for both Rankin\/Bass shows was Romeo Muller, and Maury Laws returned as the musical director. Interestingly, while Rankin\/Bassis known for the high quality of their original songs, they used Christmas standards in their sequel.  The major change in the sequel from the original is a big one, the narrator, and it can be unsettling if you watch them back to back.  While the first show was narrated and sung by Jimmy Durante, the second time we had the voice talents of Andy Griffith. Nothing against Andy, but it is a big change.\n\nAND ANOTHER SEQUEL: Another sequel of sorts was made by Rankin\/Bass with the same production team, it is a theatrical feature length movie released in 1979 titled \"Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July\".","summary":"Not the real Frosty sequel- see \"Frosty's Winter Wonderland\" for real sequel","unixReviewTime":1133827200,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

The film stars Fred Astaire as the narrator S.D. Kluger, Mickey Rooney as Kris Kringle\/Santa Claus, Keenan Wynn as the Winter Warlock, and Paul Frees in various roles. The film tells the story of how Santa Claus and several Claus-related Christmas traditions came to be. It is based on the hit Christmas song of the same name, which was introduced on radio by Eddie Cantor in 1934, and the story of Saint Nicholas.\n\nThis special is a classic.  Some images have now been cut because of various stupid reasons.\n\nThis is still a cartoon that everyone will enjoy.

One of them was the stop motion classic Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town.  Nope, I'd never even heard of it before, but I found it pretty fun.\n\nAs the special opens, we run into a mail man (voiced by Fred Astaire) who is delivering letters to Santa.  He decides to tell us all about Santa.\n\nIt starts many years ago when a baby was left in the care of the Burgermeister Meisterburger (Paul Frees).  Being the mean guy that he is, Burgermeister throws the baby out.  But he winds up in the care of a family of elves named Kringle who happen to be toy makers.\n\nThe baby grows into a man named Kris (Mickey Rooney) who decides to deliver the toys that his family makes to share the joy with kids everywhere.  But when he returns to his home village, he finds that the Burgermeister Meisterburger has outlawed all toys.  As a result of defying the ban, Kris becomes a wanted fugitive.  Can he find a way to bring joy to the kids of the village?  And what about the Winter Warlock (Keenan Wynn) who lives between the Kringles and the village?\n\nTo be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this special, and I'm not quite sure why.  Maybe my low expectations were why this one surprised me so much.  I actually got quite caught up in the story even though I had most of it figured out early.  The characters were so great, too, from Kris to his adopted family and his love interest Jessica (Robie Lester) on the good side to the villain you love to hate, Burgermeister Meisterburger.\n\nI'm not a big fan of stop motion animation.  It looks too jerky to me most of the time.  That was certainly the case here, but I actually found it charming.  Maybe I'm softening in my old age.\n\nOne drawback to this short is the music.  Outside of the title song (which Fred Astaire sings so well), all the songs were unfamiliar to me.  Frankly, they didn't add much.  In fact, I found myself wanting to fast forward through them to get back to the story.\n\nNot helping at all was how dated the musical segments were.  This special was released in 1970, and it shows.  I got a definite flower power vibe off the animation during the songs.  There were a couple of other times I felt a bit of that crept into the story.  You might also describe it as psychedelic.  My roommate found this aspect even more annoying than I did; I was mostly able to ignore it and get lost in the story again when it was over.\n\nKids, the target audience, won't notice how dated this is.  In fact, they'll find the 50 minutes over all too quickly.  Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town, and he's doing it with plenty of charm to entertain for years to come.","summary":"Have Questions about Santa?

[1970] [Blu-ray] [UK Release] The Original Christmas Classic!\n\nFor the first time on Blu-ray, rediscover the magic of Santa Claus in the Original Christmas Classic!\n\nDo you remember when the Burgermeister Meisterburger banned toys, and Kris Kringle became Santa Claus? Share the magic of this original Christmas classic told and sung by Fred Astaire! Narrated by Fred Astaire.\n\nVoice Cast: Fred Astaire, Mickey Rooney, Keenan Wynn, Paul Frees, Joan Gardner, Robie Lester, Andrea Sacino, Dina Lynn, Gary White, Greg Thomas and The Westminster Childrens Choir (Final Chorus)\n\nDirectors: Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass\n\nProducers: Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass\n\nScreenplay: Romeo Muller\n\nComposer: Jules Bass and Maury Laws\n\nVideo Resolution: 1080p\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.33:1 [4:3]\n\nAudio: English: 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio\n\nSubtitles: None\n\nRunning Time: 48:40 minutes\n\nRegion: Region B\/2\n\nNumber of discs: 1\n\nStudio: ClassicMedia \/ Studio: Universal Pictures UK\n\nAndrew's Blu-ray Review: `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' was originally a 1970 stop motion television special, made by Rankin-Bass. The film stars actor Fred Astaire as the narrator S.D. Kluger, Mickey Rooney as Kris Kringle\/Santa Claus, Keenan Wynn as the Winter Warlock, and Paul Frees in various roles. The film tells the story of how Santa Claus and several Claus-related Christmas traditions came to be. It is based on the hit Christmas song of the same name, which was introduced on radio by Eddie Cantor in 1934, and the story of Saint Nicholas.\n\nThe special was created using stop motion animation called \"Animagic,\" in which all the characters are made out of wood and plastic and animated via stop-motion photography. The special was originally telecast December 14, 1970 by ABC and continues to air every year on sibling channel ABC Family, though both channels have at times edited the special to make room for commercials (ABC has cut two key songs, as well as two other songs in half; ABC Family has cut several scenes that might be traumatizing to younger viewers, like Kris climbing, and leaping to escape to prevent children from doing dangerous stunts, Winter Warlock knowing Kris will return, & telling him he'll never escape including the scene where the Burgermeister Meisterburger character torches the seized toys in front of the children of Sombertown).\n\n`Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' was written by Rankin-Bass' go-to writer, Romeo Muller, who explores all aspects of Santa Claus' origins. Narrated by a mailman named Kluger [Fred Astaire], this hour-long special dissects the development of Kris' selflessness, and covers the origins of his beard, hearty laugh, crew of helpers, need to go down the chimney, North Pole residency (he needs to hide from Burgermeister, after all), and pretty much everything in between, providing a hugely creative look at how Santa came to be. On top of being edifying, it's wonderfully entertaining too, full of delightful set-pieces and tender moments of humour.\n\nWhereas today's film makers use 3D computer animation, `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' was executed with stop-motion technology, using models and sets to painstakingly create each frame. It does look dated and rough at times, not to mention the pacing does occasionally drag, but there's something charming about this primitive technique, especially when you consider just how much work went into every second of screen-time. Rankin-Bass movies often featured impressive casts, with the pair securing at least one or two major names for each production. `Santa Claus is Comin' to Town' has two big names, with Mickey Rooney and Fred Astaire both lending their vocal talents to the film. Astaire is a huge asset, guiding us through the story with energy and charm. He has a great singing voice, too, which enlivens the numerous musical set-pieces. Mickey Rooney, meanwhile, submits well-judged work with plenty of heart.\n\nFor over four decades now, `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' has been part of annual Christmastime traditions in many households, but mainly in North America, and deservingly so. Romeo Muller's screenplay covers the origins of many holiday traditions - including hiding gifts in stockings and how reindeer fly, while also delivering an uplifting reminder about the real meaning of the season of giving.\n\nBlu-ray Video Quality - This 40th Anniversary Blu-Ray release of `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' features a full 1080p High Definition presentation utilising the 1.33:1 [4:3] Standard Aspect Ratio in which it was originally broadcast. The video presentation looks pretty outstanding for a TV special especially for its age and all of the colours and detail look spot on, easily the best this classic family TV special event has ever been presented. Fans of this TV special should be thrilled with this high definition video presentation and the newcomers to it couldn't possibly find a better way to experience it for the first time. Because it was original made for North America Television, you can see where the adverts were inserted, because you see it fade out, with such a Classic Christmas Special transferred to the Blu-ray format, you think they could of made and effort to edit it in a much more professional way and got hold of the original master tape? I suspect when people viewed this on the DVD format, you would not see the black strings holding up the puppets. But now seeing it in the video resolution of 1080p, you can see very clearly the black string, still after a while you forget seeing this anomaly.\n\nBlu-ray Audio Quality - While it states that the main soundtrack is 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, we are instead treated to a  5.1 channel Dolby Digital soundtrack which isn't too shabby and it's certainly a pleasant surprise to find a multichannel soundtrack of any sort present for such an old special. While as one would expect, the surround element may not provide much in the way of background effects, the special sounds are pretty great here nonetheless and I think overall most will be pretty satisfied with this 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, especially if you have not got the facility of a Home Cinema set-up.\n\nBlu-ray Special Features and Extras:\n\nSadly none has been provided.\n\nFinally, amongst Christmas specials, but particularly amongst those produced by Rankin and Bass, `Santa Claus is Comin' to Town' stands apart. It does so because it is most the most triumphantly well-told of the lot, soon I will describe the most cinematic but here we're talking strictly based on narrative. This may just be Romeo Muller's, the writer Rankin\/Bass employed, best work as he makes Santa an even more heroic figure because in this tale we learn of his past, learn to think of him as a person not just an icon, and then also have an antagonist who vilifies him and renders him an outlaw. You have, of course, the talents of Fred Astaire and Mickey Rooney in this tale and the indelible figures of the Winter Warlock and Bergermeister Meisterberger and of course another classic song. It is an absolutely unbeatable combination and one of the best options for the festive season. Highly Recommended!\n\nAndrew C.

It's funny - this Christmas special with its stop motion animation looks better, more authentic, and more believable than the current computer animated Christmas specials, which look like cartoonish video games.  Anyway, everything about Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town is perfect.  I like the fact that it's sort of a \"prequel\" of sorts, telling the story of how Santa Claus evolved.

Meanwhile, the mayor of Sombertown is determined to uphold his ban on toys, much to the chagrin of Jessica, who is falling in love with Kris Kringle (Santa). As always, the Rankin Bass specials aren't complete without a message; in this case, it's good defeating evil, goodwill and love over hate and persecution. The story is narrated by Fred Astaire, who does a fine job.

{"overall":5,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"11 27, 2011","reviewerID":"A2UBSGFCP2QFNV","asin":"0307142493","style":{"Format:":" Blu-ray"},"reviewerName":"Greg Ehrbar","reviewText":"Santa Claus is Comin' to Town came to ABC first in 1970, when Rankin\/Bass was firing on all cylinders. The visual difference between this production and that of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is considerable, especially with regard to the immense, detailed sets and more intricate characters, designed by Paul Coker, Jr. Yes, there is the same animation \"on two's and three's\" as well as a few modest effects, but everything clicks within the brisk 51 minutes, none of which seem padded.\n\nWhen I asked him to name a favorite special (in The Cartoon Music Book) Musical director\/composer Maury Laws called this his favorite, because he thought every element was perfect, from the cast to the script to the overall feel. Fred Astaire proved added another dimension to his legendary career as one of the best narrators in any special. Mickey Rooney's bravado was ideal for the young Kris Kringle. Keenan Wynn's Winter Warlock was memorable (especially when he gets the choo-choo). And our beloved Robie Lester (read Mouse Tracks for more about her) was the show-stopper when, as Jessica, she undid the proverbial bun and belted out her solo, a great tune in a score that hasn't a dud in the bunch (though sadly, in today's more creepy times, \"Be Prepared to Pay\" may seem to take on an odd -- thoroughly unintentional -- connotation).\n\nSanta Claus is Comin' to Town is so spectacular that it's the visual crown jewel in the trilogy with Rudolph and Frosty. And sure, it adds yet another set of myths to confuse those trying to figure out the origin of Santa.\n\nIn this case, the story springs from the mind of writer Romeo Muller, but I wonder if, like Rudolph, this special contains a nod to its cultural context. In 1970, Richard Nixon was president, the war was raging and the counterculture was questioning. Kris and Jessica become outlaws and get married in a forest like hippies (since no town would welcome them), and the Burgermeister does resemble Nixon a little. I even noticed that, when Kris says \"It's not even safe here,\" they're standing among the burned remains of what might have been their small camp -- we get a quick glimpse and then it's gone with no other mention. This is the story of Santa as a revolutionary against political oppression.\n\nOkay, enough with the term paper hypotheses. This is Rankin\/Bass at their best and glows like a shimmering holiday display on Blu-Ray. For more about Rankin\/Bass and Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, check out the books and blog of author\/expert Rick Goldschmidt, who helped save the peppermint mine scene.\n\nNOTE: If you have the original DVD of Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, you may want to hang onto to it, though, because the Blu-ray contains no extras.","summary":"Santa Claus comes to Blu-ray","unixReviewTime":1322352000,"vote":17.0,"image":null}

Here we have Fred Astaire narrating and singing a couple of songs in this 1970 stop-motion retelling of the origins of Santa Claus.  Fred's a mailman delivering letters from kids to Santa, and he stops to answer some questions in the charming opening credits sequence which quotes most of the musical themes from the 50 minute TV special, first broadcast when I was 5.  Santa was an orphan left on the doorstep of the mean Burgermeister Meisterburger (I still love that name) in Sombretown (ok that's a little corny) with merely the word \"Claus\" on a chain around his neck.  The Burgermeister is a mean old dude and doesn't want him, and through mysterious, fortuitous circumstances he ends up with the Kringle elves in the Mountains of the Whispering Winds.  He grows up learning to make toys, befriends all the animals of the forest, and goes back to Sombretown to give toys to the kids - but is met by the Burgermeister's opposition.  Along the way the reasons for the red suit, the flying reindeer, the belly laugh, etc, are all explained, with the voices of kids breaking into Astaire's narration at times to ask him to verify that this was, in fact, how it happened.  Kinda cool even for this adult.\n\nThis was along with RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER my favorite holiday special as a kid, though it has faded for me somewhat over the years; I guess I remember the romance between Santa and schoolteacher Jessica (Mrs Claus eventually, of course) as more mawkish and sappy than it was, and I'd forgotten that the fairly dreadful \"My World is Beginning Today\" is full of cool 60s hippie\/flower people imagery.  The early parts of the story are really fairly dark and bleak, and it's interesting that, though the Burgermeister has a moment where he harks back to childhood, he never reforms and we leave him still villainous, like Potter in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  The story - original to this film I think - seems a bit influenced by L. Frank Baum's \"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus\" in the pagan\/natural nature of Santa as we see him early on; but at the end a specifically Christian element enters the picture.  Apart from the love song I already mentioned, the rest of the music is pretty good, with \"Put One Foot In Front of the Other\" probably the most memorable; it still gives me a lump in my throat.\n\nIn addition to Astaire, the voice talents include Keenan Wynn as Winter, the magician who rules the mountains and tries to stop Claus but is quickly befriended by him; professional voice actor Paul Frees as the Burgermeister and others; and Mickey Rooney as Kringle\/Santa Claus, a role he would repeat in THE YEAR WITHOUT A SANTA CLAUS.  All are very solid, especially Wynn, an underrated actor and a great vocal talent.  Overall this was definitely more fun than I remembered it from my last viewing, probably a decade ago - though RUDOLPH I suspect will always rule my inner child's heart.","summary":"Rankin\/Bass classic is near the top of their game","unixReviewTime":1261612800,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

One hour TV specials from the sixties and seventies have gone through some edits over the years, most notably the Rankin Bass specials, such as Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer, and this: Santa Claus is Comin To Town.\n\nI watched this one on TV the other night with my kid. He really enjoyed it, as it is one of those timeless Christmas shows that every kid loves at Christmas.\n\nBut there was an entire musical number cut from the TV presentation. Perhaps you remember when Jessica (the sexy puppet, who eventually becomes Mrs. Claus) has to free Kris Kringle from jail. And in doing this, she is struck with intense liberation and sexual feelings for him, that cause her to let her hair down out of it's bun for the first time ever (she was kind of a stuck up school teacher at the beggining, remember?) and dance around and sing in this psychedelic flower garden-fantasy sequence.\n\nIt is the most out of place scene in the movie, and I guess I can understand the network execs desicion in leaving it out (ABC is Disney owned these days) it's probably considered either too controversial, or just too dated,... or the fact that it looks like most cartoon animators in the seventies were on tons of acid, I'm not sure. But at any rate, as somewhat of an obsessive when it comes to small details, I couldn't get over the fact that the scene was just gone. This happens alot lately on TV. I watched Willy Wonka on TV with my kid one time and noticed that the entire psychedelic boat ride scene was chopped.\n\nBut thats what really makes the DVDs a good bet with these spcials. I'm a kid of the eighties. I have no real recollection of what the sixties\/seventies were all about but I like the style. For you peeps out there that do remember, you should appreciate the uncut renditions of these specials found on DVD. It is the only way to ensure that your kids, and your kids kids, never forget just how flipping strange you people were in the seventies. Thank you. Much love and Merry Christmas.

It will always keep the whole family entertained.  A young man named Kris is determined that the children in a drab village will finally have fun.\n\nUnder dictatorial rule of the Burgermeister Meisterburger (obviously hammed by Paul Frees), all forms of fun have been outlawed in Sombertown. Consequently it is a really bleak place for people to grow up. This is reinforced by everything being painted in greys and blacks. Kris believes that children's living in this harsh environment is unjust--and plans to do something about it.\n\nVarious facets of the Santa Claus legend have come about (at least according to this particular screenplay) from strategies which Kris and his friends had to develop in order to triumph over the oppressive government.  In this version of the story, Santa Claus is a countercultural radical (also in keeping with the 1960's anti-authoritarian motif which original audiences were themselves living through). The future Santa Claus is a thoughtful young man who was raised by elves as one of their own. They did not even mind he was human!\n\nDetermined to reach the children of Sombertown, Kris is aided by his girlfriend turned wife Jessica, who is also innovative and brave. Also opposing cruelty and facism, Jessica is no shrinking violet herself. She is the perfect partner for Kris because both want a world of love, happiness, and fairness. Again, keeping with the era this special was made, Santa Claus is presented as a free-spirit instead of an excuse for rampant commercialism.\n\nWhether this screenplay is actually true, seeing Santa Claus as a young man has always been very interesting. It's a perspective which so many other people have not addressed. This remains one of the more original holiday specials.","summary":"Santa Claus: Behind the legend","unixReviewTime":1134000000,"vote":null,"image":null}

It all has to do with the evil Burgermeister Meisterburger (voiced by Paul Frees) of Sombertown, who had outlawed toys. Of course, that is heresy to Kris Kringle, the abandoned baby who was left with the toy making Kringle family. With the help of a penguin, the Winter Warlock (Keenan Wynn), and Jessica (Robie Lester), the local school marm, Kris saves the day and comes up with all of the symbols that have been associated with the legend of Santa Claus.\n\nProduced by Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin Jr., \"Santa Claus is Comin' to Town\" features an above average songs by Maury Laws to go along with J. Fred Coots' inspirational classic \"Santa Claus is Comin' To Town.\" These include \"First Toymaker To the King,\" \"Be Prepared to Pay (Santa's Song),\" \"Put One Foot in Front of the Other,\" \"My World is Beginning Today,\" and \"What Better Way to Tell You (Christmas Carol).\" Of course, the title song is saved for last and Astaire makes you think it has always been your song.\n\nThe story is told by a mailman, effectively voiced by Fred Astaire, who takes time out from all of his holiday deliveries to set the tone for this charming holiday tale and narrate the evetns. I think of this as being a contemporary of \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\" but that actually came out six years earlier (the common denominator is that they were both clay-mation productions from Bass & Rankin). The Island of Misfit Toys makes the other one the more beloved Holiday classic, but this one is a close second, and Jessica is the cutest future Mrs. Claus of all-time.","summary":"The charming story of how Kris Kringle became Santa Claus","unixReviewTime":1070323200,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

When Santa gets to town, he befriends the town schoolteacher (education) and is branded an outlaw for giving out toys (how capitalist of him).

Remarkable!!\nBut, the show's main message is one of love and the courage to follow your heart and do what you know is right regardless of the obstacles that come in your way - so take that!....Burgermeister and Winter Warlock!

I only mention this so that readers will be able to gauge my review of this classic based on my age. While I was growing up, prior vcr tapes and dvd players, I and my friends would wait all year to view the various Christmas specials that aired each year. I remember sitting glued to the tv taking in every second of the shows. Back then if you missed part of the show or even the whole show you were border line depressed because you knew you couldn't see it again for a whole year. In some ways anticipation made the viewing of Christmas specials that much better.\nSANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN(SCICTT) is in my top five Rankin\/Bass specials. Right along with RUDOLPH, FROSTY and The Year WITHOUT SANTA CLAUS. I enjoy the 1970's feel this classic has. The flowers that appear when Jessica sings, the simple toys the kids play with and the songs that are sung throughout this show. I can only imagine what a modern version of this show would sound like with its boy band sounding songs and electric toys and video games. Instead of watching Kris and Jessica court each other and wed we would probably see them live together while they consider marriage.\nThis was a scary classic. The Winter Warlock was very scary when I viewed this as a kid. No matter how many times I saw this as a kid I would always wonder if Kris would make it past the warlock.\nI suppose the best thing about this type of Christmas classic is that when people my age view it they can escape back to their innocent youth for a short while. Even though I now own the vhs of SCICTT and soon will purchase the DVD I make myself and my kids wait until Christmas season to watch it. It's not quite the same as when I was a kid but anticipation still increases the viewing pleasure once we do watch it.","summary":"Timeless Classic!!","unixReviewTime":1003190400,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

How did he come to bring toys to children by going down the chimey and why is his workshop at the North Pole?

It is STOP MOTION animation. Claymation has figures made of clay that are filmed one frame at a time. Stop motion has 3 dimentional puppets that are animated one frame at a time like the Ray Harryhousen figures in King Kong, Jason and the Argonaughts etc. There is a vast differance in the techniques.\nThis fact aside, \"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\" is the very best of the wonderful Rankin\/Bass specials. The designer for the series of holiday specials, Paul Coker, has done an exceptional job with these delightful wooden and plastic creations. We see Kris Kringle develope from a foundling baby to the Santa figure so well known today. Each stage of his development is wonderful. But then, each of the characters is designed and executed perfectly. Watch the delightful changes of the Winter Worlock from mean and evil to mellow and fun.\nAll the animation is smooth and precise giving the excellent illusion that these figures are actually alive.\nThe songs are excellent, from the familiar \"Santa Claus is Coming To Town\" to the lovely \"My World Is Beginning Today\" sung by Jessica, the future Mrs. Santa. (For some strange reason, this delightful song is often cut when this production is shown on TV, luckily it is included in the tape.)\nThe script couldn't be better giving explanations for most of the Santa legends such as how he got his name, how reindeer can fly, why he comes down chimneys and fills stockings. It can make a believer out of even Ebenezer Scrooge.\nThis has been my absolute favorite Christmas video since I first saw it many years ago on TV. It was one of the reasons I bought my first VCR so I could make a tape of it before it was commercially available. I even have an old LP recording of the complete show.

We all agreed some were better presented than others, videos number 2 and 6 stand out as being quite exceptional, but overall every one of the segments had merit.\n\nThe viewer must get used to the format.  Each videos starts out with the host appearing soewhere in the holy land.  Then they transition to a biblical scholar based somewhere in the US.  The host only appears for a couple of minutes at the start of each lesson then plasy no further role.  Once we break away from the host, theme music runs again as if we're beginning something new.  After the second set of theme music the video will cite the Biblical reference then transition to the presenter.

Each volume contains three episodes for a total of 85-90 minutes.\n\nTypical of Dave Stotts, he brings history to life with his intriguing historical facts and well-done visual effects. And let's not forget his quirky humor! This time he drives through Israel in a Fiat, traveling the roads to the places of Jerusalem, Masada, Samaria, Shiloh, and Beersheeba, just to name a few.\n\nAs I watched these movies, I had several \"ah hah\" moments, as I connected the words of the Bible with the places Dave visited. I was able to put a visual with the accounts in the Bible, including the place where David slayed Goliath and the place where Jesus met the Samaritan woman at the well.

There is nothing objectionable in either volume, although young children may not yet be interested.

Our cable provider listed out Holiday shows in the Kids Section during the Season and I found it one year so I got the family together and we watched it. I ended up purchasing it on DVD since it wasn't on the following Christmas and I didn't have Prime at that time. Anyway, on to the review ...\n\nThe show has a couple musical numbers in it which is not a normal feature of the kid's series. They're cute and provide a nice touch. The usual cast of characters are there and we learn a little more about each of them and what they do during their own Holiday celebrations. Every Holiday is covered which has become the norm for many Christmas shows; making sure no one feels left out. As such, you'll learn a little bit about each of those Holidays throughout the vignette of the storyline. Sadly, they keep Christmas focused on the commercial end of it and do not touch upon the sacred core about Christ's birth. But, that isn't distracting or forced, it just is. Arthur's dad does insert a nod to Biblical times when he decides to ditch the usual turkey and taters for first century foods. Neither are the other Holiday celebrations forced into the storyline. They flow naturally and overall the whole show highlights themes such sacrifice, friendship, love, togetherness, etc.\n\nMarc Brown's characters are true-to-life in that he does a fine job having them mirror how kids act in the real world. As such, their reactions provide lots of opportunities to talk to your kids about what is happening during the show. At least, that's how we watch shows. : )\n\nFinal analysis, enjoyable Holiday fare; fun for the whole family.","summary":"You'll learn some new things about each character and have lots to talk about with your kids","unixReviewTime":1382832000,"vote":null,"image":null}

It is reasonably enjoyable but not much more.  There are quite a few story lines going on at once (Buster's mom and her emotional issues at Christmas, Arthur's search for the perfect Christmas present for mom, DW's anxiety over whether or not she'll get what she really wants from Santa, etc) so it isn't really focused enough to command much of an identity.  It's hard to capture much magic with a few too many varied story lines shifting back and forth.  My biggest complaint is the very forced multicultural element - not surprising since this is a PBS program, but it felt too educational & preachy in its covering of all the faith bases.  I'd prefer they make some unique holiday shows about Hanukkah and Kwanza instead of forcing the politically correct gamut at the expense of a more engaging story.\nI imagine if your kids are fans of Arthur they'll enjoy this one just fine.  There's nothing especially wrong with it, but there's also nothing especially memorable about it either.

Created by Marc Brown and based on his books, Arthur Read is an aardvark who shares adventures (and misadventures!) with friends like Buster Baxter (a rabbit), Francine Frensky (a monkey), Binky Barnes (a bulldog), Muffy Crosswire (a very RICH monkey), and others. Arthur is often at odds with his little sister D.W. (Dora Winifred) which makes for much of the shows comedic moments.\n\nIn Arthur's Perfect Christmas, the scene begins with Arthur sitting at the piano, softly playing Pachebel's Canon. This movie, like the TV show, uses day-dream sequences--and Arthur plunges into a snazzy song called \"Perfect Christmas\". You see, this holiday, Aruthur wants it to be absolutely PERFECT...but things go wrong in the town of Elwood City, for both Arthur AND his friends!\n\nFor example, Muffy expects Francine to attend her big Christmas party, but Francine has told Muffy REPEATEDLY that her family is having a Hannukah gathering the same night. What happens when Francine doesn't show up for the party to receive her present?\n\nBuster Baxter worries about his Mom who seems to obsess over having a perfect Christmas for her son, especially since the divorce. Buster comes up with \"Baxter Day\" which takes the pressure of his Mom and displays the true meaning of the holidays--love and kindness.\n\nArthur searches the mall for presents for his parents, D.W. is desperate for a Tina the Talking Tabby (whose theme song haunts Arthur everywhere he goes!), Uncle Fred makes an unexpected visit on his way to a Floridian Christmas, and Arthur's Dad insists on making an \"authentic\" dinner that was likely served in Bethlehem over 2000 years ago.\n\nHolidays such as Kwanzaa and Hanukkah are also highlighted making this a fun and informative DVD.\n\nI bought the Arthur's Perfect Christmas DVD for my son several years ago and it's STILL his favorite. I just brought out the Christmas DVD's and VHS's and he plays this one several times a day. It's filled with fun songs (24 of them!), witty banter, and clever wordplay. Not only that, there's a great message that expectations often disappoint and that a wonderful experience can arise out of mishaps and situations not going as planned.\n\nThis 60 minute DVD doesn't have any extras (except for previews of other Arthur DVD's), but this excellent movie is well worth the price in my opinion. My husband and I get a kick out of the cleverness shown in Arthur TV series and this movie is no exception. And as I said, it's my son's favorite holiday movie.\n\nHighly recommended for kids and parents alike!","summary":"Excellent Holiday Movie!","unixReviewTime":1132704000,"vote":28.0,"image":null}

I already knew that I was having problems with a nervous bladder, but when I experienced a prolapse, I was frightened.

I decided I'd rather do this in the privacy and comfort of my own home. Tasha Mulligan is a PT and specialized in this area. The anatomy and explanations are well done and well presented for visualization. This was important - and helpful - to me. Also helpful, is the quiet, matter of fact voice, the pace of the workouts, and her counting. I can't count, concentrate and exercise at the same time - I need someone else counting!  It took a full month of using this on the FIRST set of workouts, before I could slightly feel the muscles move.  It was in the second month that I began noticing the improvement of bladder issues, with the other nice side effect of seeing a slightly thinner waist and stomach muscles. The third month, the prolapse was not bothering me.  I have followed up with my OBGYN who let me know I was doing the right thing and encouraged me to keep it up.  I'm still only doing the first and part of the second sets of workouts.

After watching this 10 minute Star Wars\/Shakespeare spoof, I'm not sure I want to.  I'm sure it's a fine movie, but what \"George Lucas in Love\" accomplished in only 10 minutes surely can't be improved over the course of a 2-hour movie (perhaps I'm also still bitter that it beat \"Saving Private Ryan\" for best picture of 1998.. grrrrr).  That little rant aside, Star Wars is probably the most frequently spoofed movie or cultural phenomenon of all time (with Star Trek running a close second).  This current incarnation takes its inspiration from \"Shakespeare in Love\" and finds a college-age George Lucas struggling to find his inspiration to write an 'agricultural space opera' for his final project.  As he walks across campus to meet with his advisor, you see many quirky schoolmates who seem to have inspired different characters and plots in Star Wars, from Han Solo to Jabba the Hutt.  Even his advisor engages in the backward speak that defines Yoda.  George finds his inspiration in the form of an attractive co-ed who's hairstyle seems vaguely familiar.  There is even a little twist that romance that I dare not mention.  This is a hilarious send up of two very successful movies and definitely worth the 9 minutes you will spend watching it.","summary":"I think I like this better than Shakespeare in Love","unixReviewTime":1023148800,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

He's trying to write a great agricultural space epic, but can't seem to put anything together until he meets a beautiful girl with big hair in the student theatre. She encourages him to write what he knows and from there it's movie history.\nThe DVD version of this short film includes a short commentary by the film's creators, an enhanced version of the film (basically a pop-up video trivia veiwing), a short \"making of\" documentary, chapter search, and a \"special\" secret feature (the code number is 1138). For being a short film, a lot of these features seem redundant. However, they fit in with the spirit of the film and make the DVD that much more entertaining.\nAlso included on the DVD are three other shorts. EVIL HILL is a parody of the Austin Powers films and the movie NOTTING HILL. A young Mr. Evil (he's not a doctor yet) is treated like a monster by the people in his small town in Bavaria. However, one day Marilyn Monroe wanders into his children's book store and his life is changed forever.\nFILM CLUB is a parody of the movie FIGHT CLUB. If you haven't seen the movie, this short parody will make no sense whatsoever. The final short is SWING BLADE, a parody of SLING BLADE and SWINGERS. That short is filmed as a coming attraction and shows what would happen if Karl from SLING BLADE moves to L.A. and hooks up with the gang from SWINGERS.\nOverall, a highly entertaining DVD that fans of STAR WARS and\/or film buffs will enjoy.","summary":"Unusual.","unixReviewTime":1016150400,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

Mical","reviewText":"George Lucas in Love may very well be the \"Form\" of a short film - what the perfect short film should be, in a higher realm of understanding.  A low-budget, well-shot, beautifully scored, and endlessly engaging piece of work, Joe Nussbaum's clever little feature never falls into film-school pretentiousness or short-film stupidity.  Although it is a one-joke premise, the directing and editing manage to keep things moving fast enough that it doesn't get old.\nThe 8-minute short opens with George Lucas, in his last semester at film school, unable to finish his final project, Space Wheat, which begins \"Not Long Ago in a Nearby Galaxy.\"  His teacher (a stubby guy who talks like a certain Jedi Master) is no real help, and it isn't until he meets a girl with hair wrapped tightly in donut-buns (a stunning Lisa Jakob, of Independence Day fame) that he finds a muse who encourages the young Lucas to \"write what he knows.\"  What he knows is the dozens of Star Wars references surrounding him, and the rest, as they say, is history.\nAs much an homage as it is a parody, Lucas in Love succeeds where so many others fail.  A review of the three other shorts on the DVD - \"Evil Hill\" (Dr. Evil meets Notting Hill), Film Club (Fight Club in a film school), and Swing Blade (Sling Blade mixed with Swingers) easily demonstrates how this type of experiment can fall flat on its face, turning into a gigglefest by filmmakers and audiences with the kinds of noses that stick up in the air.  Thankfully, Lucas in Love is never reduced to this insipid level of \"didja get it?  didja?  aren't we CLEVER!!!) that the other films on the DVD do (and, unfortunately, so many other short films available on the Internet).\nThe DVD features a commentary track by the director and producer, which reveals little about the film (there isn't much time in an 8 minute session), but there is a \"making of\" that actually lasts longer than the film itself - perhaps a first in DVD history - that has all the major players and some great behind-the-scenes stuff.  The real gem is a pop-up video version of the film that shows you all the Star Wars references - chances are, unless you are the most obsessed fan out there, you missed at least one.  There is also a secret code area where you can enter a numeric code you get from mediatrip.com, makers of this DVD.  Considering mediatrip.com is now defunct, I don't feel bad saying that the code is 1138 (as in THX-1138, one of Lucas' early films) and that the secret is a short clip of the director showing off his letter from George Lucas congratulating him on the film.\nIs it worth the money for this DVD?  Up to you.  Basically, it's a question of how big of a Star Wars fan you are.  You can download the film from several places on the net, and the SciFi channel runs it every now and then, but if you want the interviews and a crystal-clear transfer, then it's probably worth it.  Besides, it's great to roll out for your friends and show them without boring them.","summary":"Wow and Wow Again!","unixReviewTime":999388800,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

This film is less than 10 minutes long, but manages to cram joke after joke in, alluding  to many of the characters George Lucas has created for his films (not  limited to the STAR WARS films).\nThe filming, acting, and score is  superb.  My complaint is similar to others: it wasn't long enough.  I also  feel like the script could have used a little more polish.  However, this  short film is a fun and diverting fantasy, adding another dimension of  folklore to the layered theories surrounding the STAR WARS series and its  much-revered creator.","summary":"High quality film short","unixReviewTime":963360000,"vote":12.0,"image":null}

White","reviewText":"Several reviewers around here really seem to want a lot from a 9 minute film.\n'George Lucas In Love' was a very fun short. From Lucas' roommate Benji talking about an 'all powerful force' to his friends Hal & Chuck  working on Hal's 'fastest thing on campus' to a professor whose speech  patterns resembled a well known Jedi Master, this film has a heck of a lot  crammed into it's 9 minutes.  If anything, the filmmakers should have done  a 15-20 minute film! The film was very clever and enjoyable. Maybe just a  tad bit funnier than 'Hardware Wars'.\nThe music, cinematography, and  acting are all very good, indeed.  Anyone who didn't enjoy this at least a  little really needs to get a sense of humor.  Of course, it's a bit cheesy,  but it's meant to be that way.  It's presented in the slightly corny,  overblown way that 'Hardware Wars' or the 'Naked Gun' films were. The same  people who didn't understand those films probably won't understand 'George  Lucas In Love'.  It's not a 'great' film, but who cares?  It's a fun little  short by a guy who really loves 'Star Wars'.  Some have condemned the  filmmakers doing this just for the money. I seriously doubt that Mr.  Nussbaum will make a huge fortune from this film and if he does, big deal.  Nothing wrong with making money from doing what you love or making money at  all. Surely, none of the people who reviewed this film would go and work at  their jobs for free and live in a cardboard box under a bridge somewhere!  Anyway, GLIL is great fun and a great to watch before your next screening  of 'Phantom Menace' or the original trilogy.","summary":"A very enjoyable 9 minutes..","unixReviewTime":961459200,"vote":39.0,"image":null}

Now that I have a four year old son, I love finding \"pre-Elmo\" Sesame Street productions for him to watch. This is a fun special - In a nutshell, thanks to Big Bird, the Sesame Street folks find themselves locked overnight in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. At this point, various characters start having their own adventures: Oscar becomes enamored with the museum's collection of ancient Greek statues, believing them to be beautiful \"trash\" because they are missing limbs, noses, heads, etc.; Bob is forced to thwart Cookie Monster's desire to eat a painting by Paul Cezanne and other works of art; Super Grover tries to make friends with a suit of armor, thinking that it's a real person; and Big Bird along with Mr. Snuffleupagus help a 4006 and one-half year old, cursed Egyptian boy (who presumably lives by day as a mummy in the museum) solve an ancient riddle so that he can transform into a star and live with his parents in the night sky.\nAdmittedly, the Egyptian portion of the special is a bit odd; they continually make reference to the \"demon\" (played by actor James Mason) that arrives at stroke of midnight to pose the riddle's question to the Egyptian boy, as well as Osiris (the god of the underworld) who poses the final challenge to the boy's ascension. I thought this segment was great, but I never thought I would hear the word \"demon\" uttered by Big Bird - Maybe they should start having him call Elmo a \"little red demon!\" (Just Kidding).\nAs with nearly everyone else who reviewed this special, I really wish that it was available on DVD.

My sister and I were allowed to stay up late on a Sunday night just to watch it. Then I didn't see it again for many years until I found it for sale on Amazon.\n\nIt's such a cute video. The adults of Sesame Street take Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Grover, and some of the kids to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC. Just as the museum is about to close, Big Bird says that Snuffy was supposed to meet him. Of course this draws a lot of moans and groans from the adults, as Snuffy wouldn't make his debut for two more years. Big Bird sneaks away to find Snuffy just as the museum is closing! It becomes a game of cat and mouse as the night guard is sure that something weird is going on and the gang just slips by him. But the biggest story is that Snuffy and Big Bird meet an ancient Egyptian prince named Sahou. Sahou has been trying to get into Heaven for 3,000 years but he can't because he can't answer a riddle. Big Bird and Snuffy come to the rescue to come up with the answer.\n\nThere are also some cute little songs in here, like \"Mothers and Children,\" sung by Olivia, \"Don't eat the Pictures,\" done by Cookie Monster and the Girls, and \"You'll get Home Soon,\" by Big Bird and Sahou. I liked this video and I plan to share it with my own children someday because it opens up the world of art appreciation to them. Very well done.

It begins with Ernie finding a room key from the Furry Arms Hotel and he proceeds there to return it. Once there, he engages in some banter with Benny the Bunny, the hotel owner and some hotel staff. This goes on for several minutes and becomes tedious before some short Sesame Street segments are able to offer a brief respite. Some of these are good, though the song with three blackbirds is not very good and lasts too long. Also, the MC Elmo song about the Number Five is also on The Best of Elmo DVD; so, if you are looking for exclusive Elmo material for your child, this is not your best bet. Now, I like Ernie as much as the next person, but I'm not certain what they were thinking when they decided to feature so much interaction with other, practically unknown characters.

The opening song \"That's How The Numbers Go\" could easily become the numerical version of the ABC song; its jazzy and singable and goes all the way to twenty.  The setup is that Ernie stops by the Furry Arms Hotel to return a lost room key, where he shows bumbling hotel owners Humphrey and Ingrid that things (like room keys) can be organized with numbers.  I also like that this video isn't scrubbed clean of any conflict - the much-maligned bellhop, Benny the Bunny, is one of Kevin Clash's best characters, and he's terrific in this video; he and Ernie show how to return a sour face with a smile (and some innocent teasing!)\nAlthough there is one good clip - \"Martian Beauty #9,\" unfortunately, this doesn't include some of the ingenious and artistic number clips from Sesame Street past:  no bakers falling down stairs, no pinball machine, no counting marble machines.

Your alternate picking should already be very controlled\/synchronized and you should be experienced with string skipping.  It also contains some extreme finger stretches\/intervals that a lot of people might never be able to do (a shorter scale neck or extraordinary long fingers will come in handy here).\n\nIf you don't already have the skills mentioned above, I highly recommend Don Latarski's \"Guitar Theory Basics\" and Frank Gambale's \"Chopbuilder\" be bought first.

There is not a lot of sculpting performed in the practice, although her Yoga routine can provide some toning. She provides very little instruction or beginner options so I would not recommend it if you're looking for a beginner's stretching routine. For instance, during Chaturanga (slow downward movement plank), she does not give the option to lower your knees first, then goes into the full upward dog position. She does bridge pose (an advanced yoga posture) with very little instruction and poor form.\n\nAlso, if you're looking for a non-demoninational practice, this is not the DVD for you. She talks specifically about God, Jesus, and Repenting and includes quotes from the bible during what's called the \"Spritual Warm-Up\", which assumes all spiritual practitioners believe in God and follow the Bible.

This turned me off, specifically since it's marketed as a regular \"stretching\" video.\n\nThe practice is somewhat weak, Tonya's voice is too soft and she does not provide clear enough queues so you have to look up quite often to follow her routine. Moveover, the music is too load and has church-based singing which even more overpowers her delicate voice.\n\nThe introduction video section has Tonya and her single student showing their new babies. It is commendable that they both just gave birth and have made a video. All the proceeds go to \"Acres 4 Life\" which helps people in Africa learn to farm their land, which is awesome! I really appreciate their efforts and work helping people with their loving kindness, but again, it would be better to be straight forward in their marketing that their efforts have religious undertones. It's not that I don't support them, but they should be clear on the cover of the DVD that the proceeds will be used for religious-based projects.\n\nIf you're looking for a couple excellent (non-demoninational) well produced stretching DVD's, I would recommend the following:\nFull Body Stretch by Karen Voight\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Full-Body-Stretch\/dp\/B00467182C\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Full Body Stretch<\/a>\n\nCool it Off by Mary Schaefer\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Cool-It-Off-Debbie-Siebers-Slim-Series-Stretch-Recovery-Workout-DVD\/dp\/B000A3XER8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Cool It Off - Debbie Siebers' Slim Series: Stretch\/Recovery Workout ( DVD)<\/a>\n\nTotal Body Stretching by Cathe Friedrich\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Cathe-Friedrich-s-Total-Body-Stretching-DVD\/dp\/B000B872PC\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Cathe Friedrich's Total Body Stretching DVD<\/a>\nand Stretch Max\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Stretch-Max-with-Cathe-Friedrich\/dp\/B001E65A8G\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Stretch Max with Cathe Friedrich<\/a>\n\nDeep Stretch with Mimi Solaire\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Deep-Stretch-Yin-Yoga-with-Mimi-Solaire\/dp\/B001JT6Y8S\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Deep Stretch\/ Yin Yoga with Mimi Solaire<\/a>\nand Back in Shape\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Back-in-Shape\/dp\/B0001BRMUE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Back in Shape<\/a>\n\nSave Your Lower Back with Annetee Fletcher\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Save-Your-Lower-Back-Release-Strengthen-Stretch-with-Annette-Fletcher\/dp\/B00097C4B2\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Save Your Lower Back - Release, Strengthen, Stretch with Annette Fletcher<\/a>\nand Stretch & Joint Mobility\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Stretch-and-Joint-Mobility-Therapy\/dp\/B00095MBNK\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Stretch and Joint Mobility Therapy<\/a>\n\nPilates for Flexibility by Amy Brown\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Pilates-for-Life-Pilates-for-Flexibility\/dp\/B000BNKB14\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pilates for Life: Pilates for Flexibility<\/a>","summary":"Postpartum Yoga-Lite and Prayer","unixReviewTime":1339372800,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

He starts the reader off with basic scales and simple patterns for playing over changes. From there it's on through more complex scales and  patterns and finally, soloing, illustrated with a number of transcribed classics.\nCombine this book with the Simandl book for basic technique (and a good library of jazz albums), and you have just about everything needed to guide the beginning bass player through the intermediate stage.

Buy this, and it will keep you busy for a very long time, whether you study double or electric bass.\n\nRufus Reid is a jazz bass player, and this book teaches you through jazz. It goes from the most basic whole, half, quataer, eighth and sixteenth note exercises, and slowly shows you how to build walking lines. These increase in complication, and if you hit the end of this book, no easy task, you will be at least a good jazz player, ready to play whatever type of music you want.\n\nI never did get there- I and my spastic little ten appendages  went to university and learned two more instruments--a typewriter and, later, a computer. You judge the results.\n\nI did, however, get to both see and meet Reid: he taught at what was then William Paterson College-now university, and used to play there on Sunday afternoons.

The companion DVD (available separately and highly recommended) is a gem in which Rufus jams with two of the finest contemporary musicians illustrating various aspects of the text.  The DVD is worth the price just as a performance video.\n\nWhile loosely defined as a method, the \"Evolving Bassist\" is really more of a well thought out approach to playing the instrument.  The skills taught follow several threads of theory and practice, but it's not a beginner tutorial even though very early players will benefit from the material...and continue to benefit throughout their playing career.  If one is desirous of a more basic text in the jazz genre then you must get \"The Michael Moore Bass Method\", probably the best tutorial currently available; the classical  \"Simandl\" material notwithstanding.

A better photographer and a better director could have done wonders with just that.\n\nThe first event in an Istanbul cafe is quite close to a Clouseau movie, but it quickly distances itself from that feel.\n\nThe film was quite ambitious for that Disney period, with lots of potentially exciting chases (which never quite get there,) we get custom spy cars & a Rolls-Royce chase, laser shooting speedboats, a sky lift escape, a helicopter and a mechanical wing contraption, which sometimes works and sometimes does not.\n\nOliver Reed as the villain is an absolute mess, but the two male leads (Michael Crawford and James Hampton) have a quirky relationship that brings to mind The Greatest American Hero (also 1981) down to even having a toothy lead with curly blond hair. Too bad there is no chemistry with Barbara Carrera.\n\nWhile the description might superficially resemble Kick-Ass (2010), the movie features a comic book artist living out his heroic fantasies, one has really nothing to do with the other.\n\nThe animated title sequence is by Richard Williams?

(1985), with an American civilian mixed up in international intrigue. And as much as I still like Gotcha!, Condorman is the superior movie. Gotcha! is all nerdy hormones and awkwardness, while Condorman just rolls out fantastic comic book surprises one after the next.\n\nFor an actor whose career apparently peaked with this movie, Michael Crawford does a great job and is very likeable. James Hampton is a guy with not a ton of name recognition, but has a ton of face recognition, and is great in this movie. Barbara Carrera went on to be a Bond girl opposite Sean Connery 2 years later, and is very much a Bond girl here and Oliver Reed plays a menacing villain.\n\nEven though The Cat From Outer Space (1978) has more than 6 actors with speaking lines, and a cast filled with recognizable stars from TV and Disney movies, Condorman is just as much fun.\n\nThe Region 2 Disney UK DVD comes with no special features. Audio options are English, French and German. With Subtitles options being English, French and German as well. The credits all come at the beginning of the movie, which was how credits were done until George Lucas changed the industry with Star Wars, so the lack of end credits seems a bit jarring. When I played this on my computer with the VLC player, there was black bars both below and on the side of the image. But in my multiregion Blu Ray player, the image wiled my widescreen TV.\n\nSeveral UK sellers on Amazon are selling this for under $10 plus shipping and at that price, you can't go wrong with this DVD, if you have the ability to play other region DVDs.","summary":"Still holds up great - Great Fun!!!","unixReviewTime":1429315200,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

Bala","reviewText":"CONDORMAN was a childhood favorite of mine, and, brother, I have been waiting impatiently for a Region 1 DVD to get my mitts on. So it's about time (but now I'm cheesed with the DVD's lack of special features). I find it really hard to be objective with CONDORMAN, this film being such a cherished memory. Having seen it again very recently, I can't help but note the datedness, the laughably rendered laser beam effects, and that hokey theme song and the cheesy cartoon Condorman in the opening credits. But mostly I happen to think that the film does stand the test of time, in terms of its watchability, its humor, and its sense of wonder and adventure.\n\nSome SPOILERS now, peppered throughout.\n\nA conscientious comic book artist, Woody Wilkins won't put anything in his comics which his characters couldn't do in real life. As such, the movie opens in Paris with Woody gigged out in full Condorman regalia and leaping off the Eiffel Tower to test his Condorman wings. It sucks for him that the wings malfunction and he ends up diving into the Seine river. So right away you get a sense of what this cat is like: an adventurous dreamer.\n\nWoody thinks that his friend Harry's job in the CIA is fraught with excitement and skullduggery, even as Harry insists that he's merely a file clerk. But when Harry is tasked with finding a civilian to handle a simple courier assignment in Istanbul, he taps Woody for the mission. In Istanbul Woody meets the mysterious Natalia and impresses her when, in a pretty hilarious scene, he inadvertently takes out several enemy agents.\n\nCut to some time later, and we finally get to the central plot. The CIA learns that a Soviet KGB operative codenamed the Bear wants to defect, but that the Bear wants only the agent known as Condorman to act as the primary facilitator. Woody is initially reluctant, but caves when he learns that the Bear is actually Natalia (who's mistaken Woody for a top agent) and that the CIA has agreed to bring his comic book designs to life. The rest of the film treats us to more globetrotting exploits, zany secret agent and superhero antics, and a whiff of romance.\n\nSo, if you're a kid at heart, CONDORMAN should be right up your alley. One of its strongest points is that it does a good job of massaging your sense of wish fulfillment. Because who hasn't daydreamed of accomplishing daring deeds, of coming out the hero and winning that girl? CONDORMAN is awesomely nerdtacular.\n\nMichael Crawford, if you remember him at all, is more famous for stuff like HELLO, DOLLY and for playing the Phantom of the Opera on stage (for which, to give him his just due, he garnered massive props). Crawford is skinny, gangly, boasts a non-heroic voice, and isn't who you first think of when drawing up the prototypical intrepid man of action. But he's good as the comic book creator\/nerd with aspirations of derring-do. This is a Disney flick, so, it's certainly wholesome enough and its sensibilities lean toward the youngsters. A  film like this can get away with a character like Woody Wilkins, a \"foolish dreamer who draws comic books\" who then takes on the identity of one of his creations.\n\nIt helps that Condorman has a supporting cast who mostly plays it straight, notably Oliver Reed as the sinister Russian masterspy Krakov, Barbara Carrera as the exotic femme fatale Natalia, and James Hampton who plays Woody's amiable pal and CIA contact Harry Oslo. Jean-Pierre Kalfon, the sorta scary one-eyed Russian hitman Morovich, does it over-the-top, but, really, what else can you do when you're sporting a menacing glass eye and tearing down the Yugoslavian roads in an intimidating black Porsche? And, man, watching this film again just brings back those good old days, when the Iron Curtain was still up and the U.S. and the USSR were still kicking it Cold War. The prevailing thought back then was that the Russian Bear would be a superpower forever...\n\nCONDORMAN is loosely based on Robert Sheckley's novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Game-of-X\/dp\/0441273084\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Game of X<\/a>, which I haven't read but have just now ordered online because I hear good things about it. Catering to Woody's intent that Condorman be an international crime fighter, his plan to help Natalia defect involves their navigating a circuitous route, from Yugoslavia to the Swiss Alps to a final showdown in Monte Carlo. Considering that they end up running a gauntlet of enemy operatives in all their stops, they might as well have taken a direct flight home. But where's the fun in that, right? I thought it a perfect touch that Krakov is able to anticipate Condorman and Natalia's itinerary simply by reading Woody's comic books.\n\nWhen I saw this as a kid, I was totally enthralled by the James Bond-type gadgetry. Even now, I still get a kick out of watching the sluggish Gypsy conveyance transform into the sleek Condormobile and then into a hovercraft. The laser guns, however, sucketh big. Note that CONDORMAN is more a lighthearted spy thriller than a superhero caper. Woody as Condorman appears briefly in the opening sequence and then in the last act. And, as Condorman, he doesn't really indulge in hands on fighty fights but instead settles for foiling the bad guys from a distance, soaring on wings from above and then firing off missiles at them from his Condorboat. I dug the costume, though, and as an L.A. Dodger fan, I'm glad the film closes out in Dodgers stadium, even as Woody receives his next cloak & dagger assignment. I wish, though, that we'd seen something of Woody's other creations. I can't help being intrigued by the likes of Gopher Boy, Bazooka Boy, and Laser Girl. Where oh where can I get me some of those fun Zowie Comics?","summary":"CONDORMAN - how a nerdy comic book artist became the Vulture of the Western World","unixReviewTime":1243123200,"vote":null,"image":null}

About Woody (Crawford) who is a comic book writer who's best friend Harry (Michael J Fox's father in Teen Wolf\/Longest Yard (original) guy who dies) is a file clerk for a spy company, who when left in charge to send a civilian to Istanbul to deliver some spy papers, he bumbled his way into making a top KGB agent (Natalia) believe he is a top agent and she later wishes to have him help her defect to America.\n\nWoody takes on the challenge and finds himself being chased by Natalia's boss\/lover or whatever and his team of henchmen while Woody pulls out all his toys and gadgets to help aid their escape, in the fashion of Woody bringing his comic book super hero character to life.\n\nSeeing this again many years later, I can see why it is more of a cult classic then a very popular action\/adventure comedy. But, it is still a lot better then most of the **** that floods the shelves these days, and this one is very underrated as a b grade comedy.\n\nThe character of Woody reminds me of Maxwell Smart, a bumbling secret agent who doesn't always escape by skill or outsmarting the bad guys, but by unintentional luck, but gets the girl in the end. Just try to imagine Maxwell Smart wants to be Batman at the same time, and that is about what Condorman is.\n\nA lot of humor, zany antics, car chases and star wars lasers.. all blended in for a fun ride.\n\nIgnore anyone selling this second hand on amazon or anywhere else for over 20 bucks... they are ripping you off hard. The DVD quality is not that great, it kind of looks like it was done straight from an old VHS to DVD without bothering to clean it up. And there is no bonus features. This DVD deserves more respect then this, and I hope Disney decide to do a special edition of it someday.\n\nOh yeah, not to forget, the second hand sellers are selling the out of print region 1 version... the DVD is still in print in region 4 for about 10 bucks, and includes another film with it too. And don't worry about the region stuff, they play in any old computers DVD player. So I'd recommend doing the smart thing and finding the ones still in print and pay a whole heap less then these clowns prices.\n\nand to the person who is selling it for 500 bucks, BWUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH, you have a b grade movie there, not the holey grail.","summary":"169,,,, 500 bucks? hahahahahahhahahahaha","unixReviewTime":1198454400,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

It was 1981 and I had saved up my pocket money to pay for the bus ride into the city and the admission for a matinee to a movie that seemed so exciting and lively to me.\n\nI had read the book 'The Game of X' by Robert Sheckley as well as the adaptation of the movie by Heather Simon and imagined every scene in my head as I had gone through it. The movie was everything a young boy could have hoped for - a rollicking, comedic adventure with a very beautiful female Russian agent (Carrera) and a sinister KGB chief (played by Oliver Reed).\n\nThe only problem I have with this movie is the miscasting of Michael Crawford as Woody Wilkins, the cartoonist who helps out a friend of his at the CIA office in Paris. Englishman Crawford puts on the most exaggerated American accent imagineable, although admittedly he has the brilliant comedic timing necessary to pull off this role.\n\nThe CIA in France has a problem. They need a civilian to act as a courier to Istanbul. Of course Woody gets the job, but right from the start it's obvious he is taking his role just a little too seriously. By the time he arrives to meet his KGB contact in Turkey he has fully assumed the role of his cartoon creation - top CIA agent and superhero Condorman.\n\nBarbara Carrera (who two years later would get to play a Bond girl - the very movies this one attempts to lampoon) plays KGB agent Natalia. Later, when she makes the decision to defect, the impressive Condorman comes to mind as the only CIA agent she will trust to handle her defection.\n\nThe only problem is the CIA does not have an agent with the codename Condorman.\n\nWhat follows is an adventure filled race across Europe with enough gadgets to fill several Bond movies. There is some great car chases (performed by legendary French stunt driver Remy Julienne and his 16-man crew of drivers and mechanics), boat chases and along the way Crawford sports some of the most outrageous disguises in cinema history.

Wheeler","reviewText":"For some reason it seems fashionable to criticize this production, mainly because it carries old footage from Masterpiece Theatre, hosted by Russell Baker.  Further, this film was sponsored by Mobil Oil Co. and produced by the BBC.  In addition, some reviewers may see it competing with the classic starring John Mills and Alec Guinness from 1947.  Moreover, since this 1999 film was made, weve had the 2011 production starring Gillian Anderson and other versions, as well.  But viewers who fail to see this 3-hour epic from 1999 are really missing the best rendition of what may be Charles Dickens best novel.  The story is timeless and inspiring; the romance, touching and well-portrayed.  TV simply cant be better than this.\n\nCasting is almost perfect with a young Ioan Gruffudd playing the grown up Pip and Gabriel Thomson the young Pip.  They look so much alike youd swear they're related in real life.  Beyond this, Charlotte Rampling seems an ideal choice for the quirky Miss Havisham, as does Justine Waddell playing the wounded Estella.  Other cast members, like those playing Magwich, Jaggers, Herbert Pocket, Joe, Wemmick, Molly, et al are equally well-chosen.\n\nThe ending of this story is not really a happy one.  Abel Magwich meets a grisly end, Miss Havisham is burned alive, and the romance between Pip and Estella seems to be in limbo.  One has to be reminded that Charles Dickens wrote the story and did two versions of the ending.  This is the happier of the two.\n\nI don't know what other reviewers are talking about when they find fault with how dark and grim this production seems.  Im sure its exactly what Dickens would have wanted and exactly right for 1999.  No, I wouldnt object if the video were re-mastered into true HD-widescreen but I felt Id waited long enough to see this flim again.  No sign of a re-generation was found from BBC so I purchased it at a decent price on the secondary market.  If and when a re-mastered version of this classic appears I will want to buy it.\n\nSumming up, those who haven't seen this version of Great Expectations shouldnt wait any longer.  Go and buy a copy from one of the Amazon re-sellers like I did.  This is the best version you will find and its production values are fine for now.  When a re-mastered version is released, Ill buy it.","summary":"The Best of Charles Dickens","unixReviewTime":1390694400,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

There were a lot of close-up shots as you would expect from a movie made for television. Charles Dickens's story tells how riches can make an average man into a gentleman, and no one seems to care as to the origin of these riches. Could someone who becomes wealthy through illegal or unethical means become a respected gentleman? Yes, it has happened many times.

Dickens is so cruel we cannot imagine he is a man, what's more a humane human being.\n\nA poor orphan, Pip, is raised by a poor blacksmith. A life of rough and tough luck. Take it or leave it, but there is no way out, except the radical one. And he dreams of being a gentleman one day. An aberration of course, morally wrong and bad taste.\n\nHe is selected and invited by Miss Havisham, a deranged rich woman who is mourning in total decay and sorrow after the failure of her wedding when the bridegroom did not come, twenty years before. Her objective is to provide a male companion and eventually husband to her adopted daughter, Estella.\n\nBut one night on the moor Pip is \"accosted\" by an prison escapee of some kind who asks for food and the boy of six or seven, maybe eight provides in the night, including a file for him to get rid of his manacles. He will turn up as his benefactor.\n\nLuck, luck and luck. But then systematically Dickens shatters every single opportunity and hope on the side of the boy, Pip, who ends up in prison for unpaid debts, on the side of his benefactor, Abel, who will die in prison holding Pip's hand after his final arrest, on the side of Miss Havisham who will achieve none of her plans, on the side of Estella who will marry the rich and noble young man, will be brutalized and will end up alone in Miss Havisham's house, on the side of Biddy who will marry Joe the Blacksmith when Pip finally realizes she had been his closest ever friend, and even on the side of Estella who will refuse to requite Pip's love, though she will accept to make him her platonic companion in Miss Havisham's.redecorated house.\n\nThat cruelty is so extreme that we just wonder if Dickens then is not going through a phase of complete social rejection, rejection of the upper classes, rejection of the lower classes, rejection of justice, rejection of any discourse about the possible improvement of individuals and society. Absolute resignation and pessimistic submission to a totally inhumane world that only has some small pockets of satisfaction, but never for yourself, always for some rare others. He did not even salvage the exiled criminal who became Pip's benefactor, as Victor Hugo did in Les Misrables, and makes him die a solitary, nearly solitary death in prison with the sole company of the young man he tried and failed to help, and unaware of his daughter's fate, which does not seem to be particularly brilliant anyway, since she is Estella, daughter of a female assassin and a male exiled criminal condemned to absolute reclusion for life.\n\nI just wonder if here Dickens does not reach Zola's pessimism who considered that anyone born in a criminal circle could only be that and drag everyone around him down into that criminal circle. No salvation for those who are badly born. The belief in an elected people turned into a savage and wild social Darwinism: some have been elected to be crushed and powdered by life as slowly as possible for them to regret ever being born but absolutely unable to shorten the ordeal.\n\nSad and sad and sad.\n\nDr Jacques COULARDEAU","summary":"One of Dickens's stories that have no happy ending at all","unixReviewTime":1301356800,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

Therefore, my eyes are just as content to watch the 1981 version, which develops the characters much better (even if it drags on at times.)\n\n- This production does not develop Orick's character, or Estella's character early in the production. In fact, Mr. Pumblechook and other characters are also not as developed as I would have wished.\n\n- Dickens' novel drags on in the middle. This production greatly contracts the plot in the central half of the novel. For example, Bentley Drummel and Matthew Pocket's characters are not developed very well in the middle part of this work. Matthew's father is nearly eliminated.\n\n- This words spoken in this production have been updated from the 1981 adaptation and the novel. In fact, the 1974 adaptation is more accurate than this 1999 production as pertains to including famous quotes from the novel.\n\nOne positive of this adaptation is that the mood (the psychology) of this adaptation is better than the 1981 version or any other version I have seen. A second positive is that the acting is this production is just as good as the 1981 adaptation.\n\nIn summary:\nI prefer the 1981 version best (even though I would only give it a 4 star). However, this production is better than the 1974 Michael York\/Sarah Miles adaptation, which completely eliminates the character of Orlick.\n\nFor people who want a film to watch for pleasure (rather than to prepare for a major content examination), this adaptation may be the most interesting and best choice.

They were together 21-years, and had ten children. During his marriage Dickens wrote his brilliant novels: \"Oliver Twist\" 1839, \"A Christmas Carol\" 1843, and \"David Copperfield\" 1850. Mr. Dickens divorced his wife in 1858. Mr. Dickens wrote the story \"Great Expectations\" after his divorce in 1861. Divorce affects everyone no matter the circumstances.

Mobile Masterpiece Theatre's telling of Great Expectations accounts for many of the most important parts of the story, and those who have never read the book (or, those who chose not to read it in high school), will have an easy time understanding the story of Pip's rise and fall in both love and status. Certainly this is not some cheesy modern remake that tries to be hip and cool; instead it modernizes the tale in a way that is very \"Dickenseque.\"\n\nOne of the greatest strengths of the film is characterization. Some may see Estella and Miss Havisham as being a little more \"sensitive and kind\" in this version compared to the novel, but overall they fit their roles well. Ioan Gruffudd does a superb job of Pip as an adult, who learns of his great expectations and tries to use these to gain a better status in life .Abel Magwitch, who is the convict who helps Pip earn a better life, is also played very similar to the character in the novel. I also felt that Joe was depicted essentially as the character in the book, and he really brings to life his love for Pip despite the fact that Pip at times resents him. Some of the other minor characters are also fun to watch: Mr. Jaggers, Mr. Wemmick, Mr. Pumblechook, Herbert Pocket, Biddy. The great thing about Dickens' characters is that they are unique and, at times, eccentric and, as a viewer, you can readily identify those characteristics as they come up in the film.\n\nAnother aspect of the film that was refreshing was just the scenery. The scene at the beginning with Pip encountering the convict in the cemetery, the grassland scene at the beginning and the end of the movie, and the dreariness of London (as Pip first arrives) all seem to be very illustrative of the attitude of the film.\n\nOne disappointing aspect of the film was that, at times, it was too obvious and blatant. It's almost as if the director decided that people were \"too lazy\" to understand certain parts, so they just thought they'd have a character \"fill in\" exactly what happened  rather than trying to let you decide on your own or show the scene the way it was intended. One example of this is the conflicts between Pip and Orlick.\n\nApproximately 3 hours in length, this film still manages to cut quite a bit from the book and seem relatively short in length. I highly recommend this version, and it is much better than the Ethan Hawke\/ Gwyneth Paltrow version of Great Expectations, which is very loose in its translation.\n\nIf you are looking for a modernized version of a great classic by Dickens, this is it. This film also works well for any teachers who want to do a comparison between the film and the book.\n\n4  stars","summary":"Modern, but very true to the story","unixReviewTime":1151884800,"vote":19.0,"image":null}

I really enjoy historical dramas, especially BBC tv series. In this Great Expectations, the acting was good, especially the heartless little Estella. However, what I didn't like about the movie:\n1. Too much scenery, not enough interaction. Instead of 10 seconds of Pip walking on the moors, we get 30 seconds. The same goes for birds flying, waves on the water, Pip walking through dark tunnels, Pip walking through dark streets, Pip walking up stairs, Pip rowing a boat. Pip opening doors and walking down dark hallways. Lots of extended scenes of scenery and no character conversations. Also, there're lots of scenes of Pip and Miss Haversham, Joe and the convict. But, there's next to no scenes of Pip and the love of his life, the grown-up Estella. Which leads to the next point:\n2. As a result of the lack of scenes with Pip and Estella, we hear secondhand that she's unhappy, and we only hear Pip say that he's in love. The editing\/screenplay is so choppy that we never hear why or how. I guess we are to assume from 10 minutes of the movie that Pip loves her madly because she is pretty and treats him very cooly.\nI mean, honestly, we get what's got to be a total of 30 minutes of boring scenery in the movie, and then almost none of the adult Pip falling in love with Estella, or what happens to Estella after marriage?\n3. Discontinuity. I don't understand why Estella is so heartless and cruel as a child, then comes back as a soft mannered, kindly seeming lady. Is this a gentleman-trap of some sort?\nI give this 2 stars because the acting was very good, but the storyline is super choppy, cryptic, and unbalanced.  It would have been better if more time had been spent on explaining the plot instead of long panoramas of the scenery.","summary":"Not a good movie","unixReviewTime":1087344000,"vote":11.0,"image":null}

As if to resist the Americanized version starring Ethan Hawke made the year before, this film version, as far as I know, is the least romantic one ever made.  Whether or not you like the film solely depends on this aspect, so let me tell you about it first.\nThe story is comparatively faithfiul, spending about 3 hours to cover the story of Pip, an apprentice of blacksmith who unwisely perhaps, falls in love with cold-hearted Estella.  But the film, as I said, gives more stress on darker side of the book, so the love theme is not explored as deep as other versions such as David Lean's or Alfonso Cuaron's.  Rather, the newer version seems to give more emphasis on the Pip's guilty feelings deep rooted in his contact with the runaway convict Magwitch, and the film's way of shooting the famous opening of the book, which relates their encounter on the graveyard in the marshes, gives us no time for savoring Dickensian humor.  The film uses the technique of flash-back, in order to express Pip's fear, which, I am afraid, is overdone for its own sake.\nI do not follow every details of the story (you probably have read the book), but I have to say this; like I said, this film is endowed with least amount of humor and romance.  Sure, you see Wemmick's most casual wedding; you see Biddy, Joe, Herbert (not all Pockets however), but you cannot expect to find any humorous scnes, one of Dickens' trademarks.  So, when Pip recounts how he met Miss Havisham before his sister and Pumblechook, he is literally forced to talk.  As you know, this is one of the humourous scenes of the original -- even though the humor is downplayed -- where we can see Pip makes up his own story, which gets more and more outrageous as he goes on.  But the director here didn't seem to see that way, depicting the whole incident as simply terrifying one for Pip, who must receive as much scolding and harsh words from them, as if in a tortune.\nJustine Waddle, often cast in costume dramas, is good as grown-up Estella, but before she could show something, the film goes on to follow the story of Pip, who must face bravely several darker moments of life (you know what I mean -- Orlick and Themes River), thus making least use of romance between Pip and her.  Actually, the film shows more of mud (of London and Pip's village) and decay, so the first thing Pip sees in London is the butchered cattles hanging on the hook.  It is true that Dickens' original book tells how Pip, arriveing in London for the first time in his life, wanders around Smithfield, then an open-sir cattle market, but ... do we need to know that?\nThe portrayal of Gruffudd's grown-up Pip is so-so, but the most disappointed thing about the film is Charlotte Rampling's Miss Havisham.  Not that her acting is bad, but her Havisham simply does not convince me, being too weak in her gestures.  She should be more authentic as this witch-like woman often found in fairy tales, who commands people, not just talks.  If she does not follow the flamboyant acting of Anne Bancroft, that is OK.  I just need more enticing mystery in this enigmatic, willful woman, Havisham.\nOverall not bad if you look for bleak atmosphere in Dickens.  But for those who seeks for humor and romance in him, this is not the one to see.","summary":"Beautifully Shot But the Least Romantic and Humorous Version","unixReviewTime":1045526400,"vote":7.0,"image":null}

The slipshod script is the real villain of this WWII-flavored take on THE DEFIANT ONES. If nothing else, the gorgeous South Seas location scenery is worth gawking at. Some solid bonus content adds value. The nice hi-def transfer helps make this a marginal recommend. 3 STAR film, 4 STAR Blu-ray\n\nTHOUGHTS: With a couple of top-notch stars like this film has, it should have been a singular masterpiece. Instead, the scattershot screenplay has so many inconsistencies and head-scratching lapses in logic that it makes what otherwise could have been a great motion picture merely an interesting diversion. For instance: these guys spend how many months\/years together, and yet neither one bothers to learn at least some of the other fellow's language? Basic communication is essential to increase the odds of survival and\/or rescue, not to mention simply making their co-existence more bearable. Instead, they spend the film's entire running time screaming at one another in their native tongue. For cryin' out loud, they never even bother to learn each other's names! Really?!? Sorry, not buying it. Totally unrealistic. There's also a very unfocused transition as they go from enemies who first try and kill each other, then just try to annoy each other, then capture one another and torture the other guy... to just suddenly being too exhausted to fight, so they become tolerant acquaintances. Huh??? The downbeat ending is a nice try at poignant irony, but also falls flat in its execution. (The alternate ending, equally as depressing, isn't much better.) Again, I blame ALL of this film's problems on its script, which should've had another two or three passes, at the minimum, in order to eliminate the annoying incongruities and make the narrative flow better. Both actors are excellent, the direction is steady & solid, the cinematography is outstanding and the minimalist musical score is good. However, none of that can overcome a bad script and HELL IN THE PACIFIC has a muddling, mediocre script - at best.\n\nTHE BLU-RAY: Now the good news for fans of this film. The hi-def release of HELL IN THE PACIFIC sports a really nice transfer. The picture is crisp & clean, with solid blacks, strong mid-tones, and not much in the way of artifacting, pixelation or crush (video noise). The original film grain is also wonderfully evident, (no DNR tampering\/overscrubbing!). The audio portion is clear and the soundmix is level. There are a half dozen or so bonus features, including interviews with the director and the art director, and a full-length audio commentary track, which help make this Blu-ray a solid bargain. If you love this film, this Blu-ray is a must-own. Casual viewers will still find much to admire, and lots of beautiful scenery to hold their attention. A nice hi-def effort from the crew at Kino Lorber.","summary":"OK, but could (and should) have been much, much better.

Two enemies (Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune ) on opposite sides of the war end up stranded on a deserted island together. At first they fight for resources before realizing that they need each other to escape back to civilization.\n\nBoorman does a terrific job setting up his compositions (with legendary cinematographer Conrad Hall), working with the actors. Both Mifune and Marvin were old enough to serve during World War II so, no doubt, brought some of the memories of the racist view that the Americans and Japanese had of each other during that time. I have to say that I prefer the alternate ending to the one that played in theaters as it doesn't pay off on the journey these two enemies make to becoming friends as they work towards a common goal.\n\nThe Blu-ray release from Kino does a good job of presenting the film. The film looks a bit soft in its presentation but I don't doubt this is what the film probably looked like originally during its theatrical run and the intent of Hall. It's always hard to judge because memory can be unreliable. The depth is a bit problematic at times while detail and colors are pretty good.\n\nThe audio is presented in 2.0 channel and sounds solid enough.  Lalo Schifrin's score sounds quite nice. We get subtitles in English only (although the Japanese dialog is subtitled in English as well).\n\nKino provides some interesting and very good special features. Unfortunately, we don't get a commentary track from Boorman but there is a 30 minute interview with him discussing the film. The commentary by Film Historians Travis Crawford and Bill Ackerman is quite good covering the history of the production and various tidbits. The alternate ending is seamlessly branched so you can choose that ending (which I feel is superior but you may have a different opinion if you saw this when it was originally theatrically released). Art director Anthony Pratt  weighs in the production design for the minimalist film in a 11 minute featurette. Kinko also provides five trailers (but curiously not one for \"Hell In the Pacific\").\n\n\"Hell In The Pacific\" is an exceptional film. It's a pity that we don't get any sort of surround mix for the sound (it could be that the 2.0 mix is the only remaining version of the soundtrack). I would give this 4 1\/2 stars for the alternate ending version and 4 stars for the original theatrical version.","summary":"Exceptional film from director John Borrman--Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune face off in WWII film.","unixReviewTime":1498608000,"vote":10.0,"image":null}

There are tense moments trying to discover whether it is Japanese or American, and tellingly, Marvin becomes concerned that the eagerly exploring Mifune may be shot by some American forces due to his being Japanese.\nMarvin repeatedly cries out \"Don't shoot...don't shoot....he's my FRIEND!\"\nMifune appears suddenly from the debris, frightening Marvin who exclaims \"Oh I thought you were a Japanese!\"\nThe point being that although he IS Japanese, Marvin has begun to think of him as something more than just a racial type with whom his country is at war.\n\nIt becomes clear that the base is now abandoned after what must have been some heavy fighting, but the two find clothes and saki to salvage, and also clean themselves up, then begin to enjoy some camaraderie over a few drinks.\n\nAnother weird scene ensues with Marvin drunkenly asking Mifune why the Japanese don't believe in God.\nMarvin himself, (the actor) appears very ill-at-ease performing this bit and it's not entirely successful.\nNor is the reason for this uncomfortable scene at all clear.\nThen the pair suddenly become estranged again as Mifune sees some very graphic pictures of slain Japanese in an old Life magazine and wartime hatreds emerge once more.\nThen, ...just as you think we will see if their hard-won friendship from the island and the raft journey will last or they will once again become sworn enemies......BANG! That nihilistic ending I previously mentioned happens and that's it.\n\nMany will feel they have sat through a long movie where not a lot of action has happened, only to be denied a proper denouement.\nI must admit it looked to me like they didn't quite know how to end it, and so went with the Apocalypse.\nYou may of course feel differently, but the movie as it stands remains largely a psychological study of two men, rather than any war-action piece.\n\nWARNING: Do NOT watch if the title has you hoping to see some Audie Murphy\/John Wayne heroics, with intense battle scenes.\nYou will be MAJORLY disappointed!\n\nI enjoyed it for the power struggle and the humanity emerging over the nationalism, along with the performances, but must admit to finding the ending far too sudden and a most unsatisfactory way to dispose of two characters you have come to know over such a long movie.\nDoes it all count for nothing?\nI wanted to see what they would do back in a world at war. Would they remain friends, or return to the roles that the war demanded they perform?\nI believe some copies include an alternate ending. Mine does not but it is available on You-Tube, and is only about a minute long.\nIt too is enigmatic, not really telling you all that much about what happened next.\n\nFour stars overall for me. (One off definitely for the ending.)\nI have the MRA DVD, ...transfer is good (but not brilliant) and the sound quite loud.","summary":"Hell of a way to end it!","unixReviewTime":1466467200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Both Lee Marvin (who actually served as a Marine during the war in his youth) , and Mifune, a Japanese \"star\" of quite respectable dramatic stature give fine, necessarily muted performances.  But the plot sort of drifts lazily back and forth in the Pacific Palau, in a dreamy would-be interpretation of individual land-ops which one-on-one combat most assuredly should not  (cinematically) at least) be.  To do Boorman credit, Marvin does eventually bring the subject of the (Christian) God into the confrontation, but it's pretty much too late, and the audience leaves with the somewhat dull effect of having watched a war fought between business boardrooms, one democratic and one fascist, and who really needs that kind of history, if only merely dramatic?

It was 100% pure fun and by far his most 'accessible' film for all audiences.  You will note that it had aspects of Saturday Night live and much of the comedy that we're used to.  Note that this was long before SNL and spinoffs like Animal House or Trading Places.  Woody invented some of this humor.\nThe plot is straightfoward: Woody Allen plays a chronically challenged underachiever(as always) with a long-suffering girlfriend\/spouse.  He finally holds up a bank and does it in the way only Woody could.  The sight gags, blackout sketches, and double-entendre(inside jokes) are relentless and great.  Whatever you see that's inventive and reminds you of something else, remember that it was invented here, probably.\nI recommend this film as a must-have for Woody Allen devotees and anyone who wants a good silly comedy.

Is it his piercing blue eyes, or the sense that, no matter how inscrutable his expression, there's so much more going on inside his head that we're not privy to? Green is in no way what one might consider a Hollywood-type leading man--he appears small, his hairline is receding, and he's not conventionally handsome--but the man commands the screen like nobody's business.\nI found \"Touching Evil\" to be a fantastic series, so when \"TE 2\" became available, I grabbed it. Unfortunately, it took me some time to watch all the episodes. Perhaps this was because I was so impressed with the first series that I had high expectations. Maybe it was \"sophomore slump.\" Ah, it was probably that the story arc of the first series was just plain more interesting. It is often the case that when the original creators of a series relinquish creative control to others, the quality suffers. This is also true of \"TE 2,\" which sometimes seems like a pale reflection of the original. What it still has going for it, however, is the characters. I very much appreciate the circularity of the stories, bringing characters--like Creegan's wife and kids--in and out of the story at various points throughout the series. Shaun Dingwall alternately impresses and annoys with his portrayal of the unsteady DI Rivers, and Nicola Walker--another unconventional look but undeniably powerful--just knocks my socks off when she takes Creegan to task every so often. Maybe that's the key to why I enjoy the world of \"Touching Evil\" so much: It feels like family.\nAnd although I would love to see Robson Green in more visible projects, I sort of hope Hollywood never finds out about him. They just wouldn't know what to do with him.","summary":"The second go-around is less satisfying, but still solid.","unixReviewTime":1062460800,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

DaVega","reviewText":"I greatly enjoyed 'Hell in the Pacific' and it was more than I expected. I watched this movie the other night and got a lot out of it.\n\nIt's a very involving story set during WWII about an American pilot (the great Lee Marvin) and his Japanese counterpart (the equally great Toshiro Mifune) at odds with each other after they are both unknowingly stranded on the same small, uninhabited island in the vast South Pacific Ocean. They fight and quarrel for a good first half of the movie, but ------ realizing that they are both going to have to rely on the other to get out of their situation or to even survive ------ they gradually form an uneasy alliance.\n\nI thoroughly appreciated John Boorman's obvious commitment to realism on this movie. As the film opens up, it just jumps into the story right away, beginning immediately with the image of Toshiro Mifune sitting alone near the beach and Lee Marvin in the jungle, likely just recently dropped in by parachute. The movie wastes no time with set-up or any explanation as to how they both got there. We don't know and don't need to. The editing is done at a smooth, flowing, non-hurried pace which gives the movie a definite real-time feel to it. The scenery and cinematography of the authentic Palau locations is simply stunning and I'm rather amazed by how good this movie looks for its age. The picture quality and clarity of this film is jaw-dropping for a 40 year-old movie.\nThe performances from the sole two actors in the entire film are passionate, inspired and thoroughly believable. The setting and plot is almost enough to make one forget for a moment that the two are sworn wartime enemies and we almost immediately empathize with both characters.\n\nThere are no subtitles. It puts us more inside the two's struggle since neither can understand what the other is saying. Even though those of us who don't speak Japanese can't understand what Toshiro Mifune's character is saying, we know EXACTLY what he is feeling and thinking through actions, body language, and forcefulness of expression. Watch for the scene when Toshiro Mifune's character catches a real, giant clam and proceeds to crack it open to get to the real, soft mollusk inside just for the sake of a meal. After they are finally able to put aside their differences for the sake of their mutual survival, they collaborate to build a rather impressive wooden and bamboo raft to escape the confines of the island.\n\nMy only grievance with this movie was its ending. I will not spoil it, but I will say that I did feel it was inconclusive and didn't provide me with adequate closure for the two characters' ultimate fates. Even the alternate ending still left me feeling a bit unfulfilled but I will leave it up to each individual viewer to decide for themself. The ending just didn't quite work for me and was the only element that prevented me from giving this film the full five stars.\n\nOverall though, this is still an excellent and vastly underrated 1968 gem from one of the best directors of all time, John Boorman. A unique cinematic experience in the fact that it features two prolific, unparalled actors each playing anonymous characters who are the only two in the entire movie in such a huge, isolated setting. A fasinating encapsulation of a very human story set against the backdrop of the WWII-era campaign in the Pacific.\n\n17 years later in 1985, this film would be reimagined with a science-fiction twist as 'Enemy Mine'.","summary":"40 Years Later, still an awesome movie from legendary director John Boorman.","unixReviewTime":1221350400,"vote":10.0,"image":null}

Mifune especially seeks with all his cunning to kill Marvin while the latter struggles very hard just to fill his canteen with drinking water. The tensions, very strong at the beginning slowly dissipate as both realize taking out each\nother might be very difficult but via cooperation--even despite the language barriers--two heads can equal the results of three. Mifune shows\nhis tenderness first. But both play outstanding roles. While trying to develop the peace, Marvin reads a military manual that mandates troops always to kill the enemy.  Their keen attention to the nonverbals, even as both seem not to be observing is a case study for those intererested\nin interpersonal communication.  Marvin brings in new vitality once he\nrecognizes there is bamboo on the island.  Yielding to each other in\na collaborative manner, the raft is built and launched.  Then I got the impression they had to fight high waves without food on the ocean for perhaps four days. Both are exhausted. Discovering the new island is a\ndream, that neither perhaps thought would occur.  They forage through\nthe deserted military hospital, each finding things of special interest  and then dressed neatly as military professionals toast each other\ncountlessly with a big bottle of booze.  I wasn't ready for the end but\ntried to foresee possibilities.  For those who can take a movie with very\nlimited dialogue, scores of nonverbals and two superb actors, this movie\nis a must. Those who enjoy more group drama or romantic entertainment would be bored.  I am glad to have found this movie in my collection.

It is undeniably true.  However, he was always a good actor, and even though only Kurosawa could pull the greatness from him, any Mifune performance is worth checking out.  His American-directed attempts are usually even poorer than his quickly-done super-samurai slugfests, but \"Hell in the Pacific\" is an exception to the rule.  This is good stuff.\n\nThe story is not exactly innovative.  It was done four years earlier in the Frank Sinatra flick,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/None-But-the-Brave\/dp\/B00143XE0U\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">None But the Brave<\/a>, which was also a Japanese-American collaboration.  However, whereas Sinatra had an entire platoon to back him up when making a tentative truce with the stranded Japanese castaways, in \"Hell in the Pacific\" there are only two, Lee Marvin and Mifune Toshiro.  Lost on an unpopulated island, the two enemies must first fight, then carve out a grudging respect as they realize the desperateness of their plight, and how little wars mean when there are only two people in existence.\n\nThis is a brave and innovative film.  Marvin and Mifune are the only two actors, and everything was filmed on location.  There are no mourning wives waiting for a hopeful return, no platoon of buddies still out looking, no volleyball sidekick.  We aren't even entirely sure how they both arrived there.  None of Mifune's lines are subtitled, so the frustration of communication is powerful, both for the viewer and for Marvin's character.  However, for such a sparse movie, director John Boorman is innovative in his use of location and props to suggestive a broader world.\n\nThe ending of \"Hell in the Pacific\" is a story in and of itself.  There are two versions.  One, demanded by US audiences, is a \"happy ending\", although ambiguously so.

Featuring only two characters throughout---a Japanese officer and an American officer marooned together on a otherwise unpopulated Pacific island in 1944---the film puts us immediately into the difficulties facing the two men, who are enemies by their circumstances and literally cannot understand each other. The story of how they deal with their plight unfolds in ways that make perfect sense, and both Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune as the two exiles give performances that are both believable and affecting. In fact, the only thing that keeps this from being a five-star movie for me is the very end, which, as I suspected, was grafted on at the behest of the studio heads [cf, director John Boorman's autobiography, ADVENTURES OF A SUBURBAN BOY]. The original ending, included on this DVD release as a special feature, makes much more sense and would have been better. But up until then you're watching one of the best war movies ever made.","summary":"Hell of a good movie!","unixReviewTime":1151107200,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

Telling the story of two pilots, one Japanese (Toshiro Mifune) and one American (Lee Marvin), stranded on a small, deserted tropical island during World War II it's at once fascinating and somewhat flat.  Mifune and Marvin are two of my favorite actors.  Their plight on the island, coveting or guarding precious limited resources against the `enemy', more or less drives home the point that war is a futile exercise.  Of course the question arises as to whether we can conquer our distrust before we conquer, or are conquered by, our enemy.  HELL IN THE PACIFIC is thought-provoking and beautifully photographed by master cinematographer Conrad Hall.\n\n  After a while, though, with all the attacks and counter-attacks, I got the feeling that I was in the middle of a Road Runner cartoon with no exit.  This feeling was exacerbated by such scenes as Marvin trying to teach captive Mifune (the balance of power changes a number of times) to fetch a stick like a dog.  It was an ill-conceived scene, brutishly funny if the intent was humor, but added onto the ridiculous ending HELL IN THE PACIFIC seems to have expended its creative energy well before the final credits run.  By the way, I strongly recommend watching the `Alternate Ending' in the Special Features after watching the movie.  It's the right ending for the movie, and it's a mystery why it's the `alternate' one.","summary":"Hell in the Pacific","unixReviewTime":1112918400,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

Two men stranded on a Island rather than a planet in this case. As WWII rages a Japanese and American soldier are stranded on the same small island. They try to kill each other at first. As time goes by they realize their very survival depends on a truce. Eventually they work together and build a raft. After days on the Pacific Ocean they find another larger group of islands. The uneasy truce becomes shaky again when they find remnants of Japanese and American occupation on the main island. Up to this point an excellent movie. In fact I was say close to flawless movie since the acting, sets, scenery, music, directing and all the rest are incredible. SPOILER ALERT: Now the reason I didn't give it four or five stars is because they kill them off with a single stray artillery shell in the original ending. You will be enthralled with the wonderful acting and really care for these two characters. Then to suddenly watch their lifes snuffed out just so some writer or director could make their point that war is bad didn't impress me. If someone didn't think we get that point long before the ending of this movie, they don't give much credit to the audience. Why they didn't use the alternate ending with the soldiers walking off their separate ways is beyond me. Be sure to look at the alternate ending and see if you agree this should have been the original ending.

The movie pretty much goes like this : Lee Marvin crashes into the ocean somewhere in the pacific and ends up on an island with the enemy, a Japanese soldier. Their fears and angers are played out as they both struggle to capture one another. They fight back and forth and also play mind games with one another in order to gain the upper hand. Finally, they learn that in order to survive they must put aside their animosity and work together. They slowly become friends and grow to trust one another and work together to build a small raft to escape the island. The Cinematography and acting in the movie are top notch, the only complaint I have was the original ending, but I have heard the DVD comes with alternate endings.

For a time, all the Marvin character can think to do  is pick away at the former's elaborate survival arrangements, and there is  quite a bit of humor in that.\nLeonard Maltin and the other Amazon  reviewers complain about the ending, which comes as an abrupt and  dissatisfying shock, but I think it offers the viewer a choice of  interpretations. It could be taken straight, as the objective fate of our  two heroes, or it could suggest a metaphor for their (and our) inability to  get along together, an image of humanity's potential ultimate fate --  something more in the characters' heads than on the ground....\nAnyway, a  fine, tight little movie.","summary":"A terrific psychological action picture","unixReviewTime":958521600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Even early on in his film career, Woody Allen shows genius and promise to grow much, much further than most artists ever go. The film's plot moves along at a good pace and the acting increases the quality of the movie--and the jokes.\n\nThe film, as you may well know, is a spoof of documentaries called a \"mockumentary.\" The film purports to show the life and times of a petty criminal named Virgil Starkwell (Woody Allen). We see him being bullied by his childhood peers on the streets and his failure at playing the cello signals his failure to become a successful criminal.\n\nThe film is essentially one gag after another in rapid fire. We see Virgil fail at bank robbery after bank robbery; perhaps the funniest is when Virgil and his buddies try to rob a bank when another gang wants to rob the same bank on the same day. We also see Virgil fall in love with beautiful Louise (Janet Margolin). Janet plays Louise with a great deal of realism and her matter-of fact attitude toward Virgil's bank robbing is comical as well.\n\nIn order to make Take The Money And Run feel even more like a documentary, we get \"interviews\" with Virgil's parents (who wear Groucho Marx glasses to disguise themselves) and teachers and acquaintances who knew Virgil. The acting is excellent.\n\nThe DVD doesn't offer too many extras but the movie is so well done that I will give this a five star rating anyway.\n\nTake The Money And Run is sure to give you a laugh--in fact, you'll be laughing all the way. The \"mockumentary\" style of the film enhances its comedic effect.

Neil Simon will make the list, along with Mel Brooks, and Woody Allen. There are others, of course. Together they make up one of the most remarkable flowerings of comic talent in American history. Woody's talent sprang from him fully formed. His basic gift is in full evidence in this early picture. It is debatable that he has improved with age, although it is worth noting that his exposure, like Harold Pinter's, to elegant, bourgeois life permanently altered the objects of his comic study. Mia Farrow introduced him to the good life, to aristocratic penthouse life, and there was no turning back. Still, his genius can be seen in his ability to adjust and move on. Later Woody is every bit as good as his early work, but not necessarily better, unless you happen to like posh talk and that very special boredom of the urban bourgeoisie. This early picture, though lacking in elegant settings and posh-talk, is vintage; here we having that wonderful skewering of pieties that one remembers from the Marx Brothers. Woody is wonderful at exposing pretensions, great and small. Here he plays a small-time hoodlum, a kind of Sylvester Stallone, played as a clumsy oaf, a loser, and nebbishy klutz, with eyes for the gals. Groucho, where are you? The film is a work of genius.

The world has become so much cruder and the language so much more coarse that this feels much like a family film today.  It is funny, yes, but some of it feels dated.  Comedy is often tied to its time and doesn't travel to a later time so well.  Yet, much of the movie remains terrific and classic.  There are many lines that have become part of the language (\"it is if you're doing it right\", for example).  Just go up to anyone who knows the film and say \"abt natural\" or \"I have a gub\" and they will likely begin to chuckle.  And, of course, there is the soap and shoe polish gun in the rain.\n\nIt is also nice to see Janet Margolin in one of her best roles as the female lead, Louise, Virgil's eternally loyal girlfriend.  She was taken far too young by ovarian cancer, but this role is a great one to remember her by.\n\nFor those who haven't seen the movie, Woody Allen plays Virgil Starkwell, a really down and out kid, what is a nerd called if they are also stupid?  That's Virgil.  He loves playing the cello, but without the least spark of talent.  He tries to play the cello in a marching band.  He turns to crime with even less ability than he has for the cello.  Of course, like all stupid people, he gets himself into worse trouble because he actually thinks he knows what he is doing.  However, he is also aware that nothing works out for him, but thinks it is basically bad breaks even though he understands he has no abilities whatsoever.  That mix of self-awareness and yet being completely unaware is the source of much of the humor.  It really does work and is quite funny.\n\nReviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI","summary":"A classic that is just a bit worn after nearly 40 years, but quite funny","unixReviewTime":1191801600,"vote":null,"image":null}

This fitfully funny 1969 comedy marks Allen's feature film debut as a triple threat - director, writer (with early partner Mickey Rose) and star, and it shows the earmarks of his later visual style even if the laughs are not always there.\n\nLacking an actual storyline, the movie takes us through Starkwell's life from shoplifting bubblegum machines as a youngster to bank robberies to finding the ideal woman to prison and so on and so on. This is Allen at his purest with focus on often hilarious sight gags and self-deprecating one-liners without his later forays into the complexities of the human condition. In fact, this is probably the only time that Allen has played a screen character without any intellectual pretensions. The closest he comes is pretending to be a cellist with the Philharmonic to the girl of his dreams, a pretty laundress named Louise. The best gags are probably the prison shirt-folding machine, the bank robbery where Starkwell's badly handwritten note is passed around the staff to interpret, the escaped chain gang coming into the old woman's house, the prison vaccine experiment that turns Starkwell into a Hassidic rabbi, and my favorite, the totally impossible scene where he drives a car inside a blackmailing woman's house chasing her around.\n\nOf less interest is the romance between Starkwell and Louise, who is portrayed as self-conscious and rather mealy-mouthed. Allen's usual generosity with actresses has not yet developed at this point, and Janet Margolin is forced to play Louise quite passively despite her beauty. For a movie that is supposed to take place between the 1940's through the early 1960's, it certainly looks and feels like hippie-era 1969, especially with the Austin Powers-style music over the chase scenes. Allen's first wife Louise Lasser (yes, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman) has a funny cameo as an early girlfriend. There are no extras with the 2004 MGM DVD package.","summary":"Early Woody as a Career Bank Robber Has Some Funny Sight Gags But It Just Drifts","unixReviewTime":1158537600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Check out some of the other reviews here, which recount a few of the better sight gags and funny scenarios to see what I mean.  Just be warned, though, that Woody still had a way to go before the jokes got really sharp and the storylines moved with supreme smoothness.  I don't want to overstate the criticism, as \"Take the Money and Run\" never sinks to boredom, or choppiness in the story telling.  It's just that Woody's best period was still three or four films ahead of him at this point and a certain lack of polish is still evident.  But the movie is still definitely worth a look, even though I'm not as big a fan of it as some other folks.\n\nUnfortunately, the full-frame version of \"Take the Money and Run\" is the one most easily available on DVD in this country.  On the plus side, however, I noticed no obvious and offensive cropping of the image while I watched the movie (though I guess something must have been cropped somewhere to create the full-frame image).  Also on the plus side, the print is sharp, clear, and bright.\n\nBut, alas, like most DVDs of Woody's films, there are basically no extras, just a trailer.  But we've come to expect that from Mr. Allen, haven't we?  To his credit, the man doesn't like to go on and on about his movies, preferring to let them speak for themselves.","summary":"He had better days ahead, but this is what put Woody on the map","unixReviewTime":1143849600,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

As if he would have to apologize for this instead of, say, \"The Curse of the Jade Scorpion\".  What Allen attempted here in his directorial debut is groundbreaking.  This is the first example I can recall of a director telling his film in mock-documentary style, later employed by Albert Brooks and perfected by Christopher Guest.  Allen proves himself to be not only a great comic visualist but there are great verbal puns here as well.  The conceit of the film is a gas.  We're supposed to believe that Allen's Virgil Starkwell, an inept dweeb of a criminal, if not among the FBI's most wanted does cause Mr. Hoover some sleepless nights.  The gags here are rapidfire but I wouldn't spoil it for those who are uninitiated.  My favorite being,though, is Virgil orchestrating a prison break with a gun he's fashioned out of soap during a rainstorm.  All this failed effort leaves him with is a hand full of soap lather.  Also, noteworthy in the cast is the late Janet Margolin as Virgil's faithful wife.  Margolin basically plays straight woman to Allen but it's a shame this gifted actress who was so good in \"David and Lisa\" didn't have a more substantial film career.","summary":"Auspicious First Effort by Director Allen","unixReviewTime":1138492800,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

Beusch","reviewText":"Woody Allen is a great filmmaker who has made some comedies that are also deep character studies (Annie Hall, Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters, etc.). However, there's something to be said for films like What's Up, Tiger Lily, Play it Again, Sam and Sleeper -- films that are just plain funny. Probably the best of these is Take the Money and Run which spoofs the true crime documentaries of the time. Allen plays Virgil Starkwell, a hilariously inept career criminal whose life is one misadventure after another. Using \"testimony\" from people in Starkwell's life and cinema vierte style photography, Allen peppers the audience with hilarious sight gag after sight gag. Among my favorites:\n\n1. In high school, Starkwell joins the marching band ... as a cello player. The image of Allen running up the street with chair and cello in hand, stopping for a moment to play a few bars, then getting up and running a few more feet in hysterically funny.\n\n2. Starkwell invites his girlfriend (played by Janet Margolin of \"David and Lisa\") to dinner but doesn't have the money. He breaks into several parking meters. When he tips the maitre'd, he dumps several dollars in change into his hand and all over the floor.\n\n3. Starkwell robs a bank, but the teller can't read the note he hands him, thinking that the word \"gun\" is \"gub.\"\n\n4. When entering prison, one of the guards frisks Starkwell, inducing peals of ticklish laughter.\n\nIndeed, Take the Money and Run seems a lot more like a film by Allen's former colleague on Your Show of Shows, Mel Brooks, than like one of his later films. The story is just a framework for gag after gag -- most of which are unbelievably funny. Allen did some wonderful and deep character studies later in his career, but Take the Money and Run is a hilarious comedy that should stand among his best work.","summary":"Woody in the good old days","unixReviewTime":1135036800,"vote":null,"image":null}

Marold","reviewText":"`Take the Money and Run' is the very first movie where Woody Allen is writer, director, and star, and true to the first film in any artist's series of work, it may be the his best up to `Annie Hall', his seventh film as writer\/director\/star and arguably his very best comedy. `Love and Death' and `Bananas' may a little weak. `Play It Again, Sam' has the first writing and direction where the audience develops some empathy with the characters, so it presages the more serious business of the later films. But `Take the Money and Run' is simply nonstop silliness, with some of the longest and best running gags this side of Mel Brooks.\n\nEven this very first movie has many of Allen's trademarks. For a relatively low budget movie, the quality of the music is very, very good, with original pieces contributed by the up and coming Marvin Hamlisch. Even though the supporting cast is not filled with a lot of highly recognizable actors, most of the faces such as the chain gang supervisor all seem to have a vaguely familiar look about them. Allen's female lead is Janet Margolin, for whom this is probably the highlight of her career. His `Bananas' costar, Louise Lasser, later of `Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman' appears in a very small role.\n\nTwo other trademark motifs are the flashbacks to boyhood and the cut-aways to interviews with the principle character's parents. These devices appear in `Annie Hall' and even in the relatively serious `Crimes and Misdemeanors' plus several other films.\n\nAnother typical aspect of this movie is that it is a parody of documentaries, although not with such loving artfulness as Allen does in `Zelig'.\n\nOne thing that is entirely absent is any intellectuality. I can't recall any joke for which you need to read a Russian novel or see a classic silent movie to understand. While it strikes me that poor Virgil Starkwell does have some mock heroic aspects which may have been borrowed from `Don Quixote' or `Candide', I think that may be my seeing things of which Allen had no inkling.\n\nAllen has claimed, contrary to a lot of other artists' statements, that comedy is easy. Allen is so adept in this movie at spinning off high quality jokes at such a rate that he genuinely makes it seem effortless. And yet, like the proverbial Chinese meal, you leave this movie and an hour later, you are `still hungry'. That is, you take away no warm feelings for any characters and their situations or any satisfaction that a hero succeeded in a quest or a heavy got their just deserts.\n\nSome movies have compared Allen's work to the Marx brothers. In the sense that I suspect the Marx brothers have inoculated every American comedian since their heyday, I suppose there is something there. I suggest that W. C. Fields much more directly influences Allen. While the Marx brothers used a great deal of visual humor, Fields was a true poet of the illusion of clumsiness, created with his major skill as a juggler. Allen parodies some of Fields' great moves with a pool cue. While Allen can't hold a candle to Fields' dexterity, the result is still pretty funny.\n\nMy primary recommendation for people who may like some but not all of Allen's films, this one should definitely be in your collection, whether you just like his `early, funny' movies or prefer all his styles, but want to skip over some of the darker, less well written, or less interesting works.","summary":"First triple threat from the Woodman.

He tries to stage a bank robbery, but it flops when the tellers start arguing over whether his handwritten note says \"I have a gub\" or \"I have a gun\".

I thought Take the Money and Run would be in a similar league but unfortunately it's not.\nA prescient newsreel style voiceover constitutes the narrative device of choice, putting its personal spin on events as it recounts the life of our doozy criminal, Virgil, a nerd turn notorious gangster. It is this wry commentary that lends the film its pseudo-documentary flavor, and the plot is pretty much a patchwork of such clips and thus not exactly awash with consistent humor. Certain scenes are pretty funny though, e.g., the protagonist's escape attempt at the prison that involved a bar of soap and some shoe polish, or a bizarre incident with a chain gang, etc.\nFor Allen fans, it's a no brainer: you'll see it anyway. For the rest of the viewers, I'd recommend giving other more polished comedies from Allen a try before you get to this erratic early-in-the-game cameo.

Take the Money And Run was Woody Allen's first real film to direct himself and it remains one of his funniest.  Disguised as a documentary, this 1969 film tells the hilarious story of Virgil Starkweather, the world's most inept (if stupidly optomistic) thief.  Like most of Woody Allen's early films, everything is played almost solely for the laughs it might provide and nearly forty years later, it all holds up very well.  Lots of hilarious stuff in here (at times, this film is the funniest Mel Brooks film that Mel Brooks never made) but my personal favorite bits would have to include: Virgil's parents who disguise their indentities by wearing Groucho Marx glasses but will be familiar to anyone whose seen any of Allen's films, Virgil's attempt to rob a bank is foiled when none of the clerks can read his bad handwriting, another robbery goes wrong when a rival gang decides to rob the same bank at the same time, Virgil's attempt to escape from prison by making a fake gun out of soap is ruined when it starts to rain, the sight of Woody Allen on a southern chain gang (and being punished by being locked in the hole with an insurance salesman), and especially the scene where a man Virgil attempts to mug turns out to be not only a childhood school friend but an undercover cop as well.  Directing with a wild-anything-goes-spirit, Woody Allen gives one of his first (and best) \"born loser\" performances as Virgil.  Amongst all the madness, the film also presents a bizarrely sweet love story between Virgil and his wife, who is well-played by the lovely (and the sadly no longer with us) Janet Margolin.  Always underappreciated, Margolin was one of those forgotten, at times almost painfully vulnerable actresses that one can't help but fall in love with everytime she appears on screen. Though overshadowed by the later Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow, Janet Margolin was Woody Allen's first unlikely love interest (in both film and briefly real life) and they have a strong chemistry together that adds much heart to a wild film.  Take the Money and Run remains hilarious and will be enjoyed by both fans of Woody Allen and classic film comedy.","summary":"Still one of Woody Allen's best","unixReviewTime":1012262400,"vote":47.0,"image":null}

Its only real value is as a curiosity.\nThis is Woody establishing his template for later movies, i.e., nebbishy loser, a failure at his chosen occupation, acquires an impossibly beautiful girlfriend, and tries to do right.\nThe mockumentary style he chooses to utilize for the most part works nicely. At times, though, its tone feels uneven, floating from documentary to narrative fiction and back to documentary. If he had stuck to one style the power of the satire would be much stronger. And now that I think of it, choosing to do an obviously mannered genre parody with your first film is somewhat dubious. It sent him on a path that would lead to the well-meaning but uneven films \"Bananas\" and \"Sleeper\". Not till \"Love and Death\" would he make a film where the parody serves the story rather than the story serving the parody.\nWhile most of the jokes feel forced, there are some truly hilarious proto-Woody moments. The marching band scene (with Woody gamely trying to keep up while tugging along his cello and a chair) knocked me down flat with laughter. And a moment late in the film, with Woody trying to conduct a substantive interview with a rambling subject (Woody keeps saying \"Get to the point\" from behind the camera), is a most effective moment in terms of parodying the documentary form. But other than these, and few others, I was disappointed by the humour. A running gag, where Woody's glasses repeatedly get stomped on by authority figures, was flat the first time I saw it and got flatter each subsequent time.\nThis film is definitely at the bottom of my personal list of favourite Woody Allen movies. It may be because I prefer his dexterous verbal wit to the juvenile sight gags and physical humour he employs here, or that he had yet to find his footing with this, his first outing.

For those of you who are new to the world of Upstairs Downstairs,  this series is a character driven drama which focuses on the disparate (but yet entwined) lives of the rich Bellamy's and their servants.\nCharacter growth, loss, tragedy and triumph are the themes of this season, as the characters are greatly affected by the trials of world war I.  I highly recommend this for fans of this time period, or fans of BBC drama. I particularly liked the character arc involving Edward the footman, and the arc involving Hazel Bellamy.

Several important themes, such as duty, honor, love and loss are explored through the lives of several characters.  War comes home, literally, when a Zeppelin drops a bomb on Eaton Place.  James, Edward, Georgina, and most tragically Rose and Hazel are all victims of the war's bloodlust.  There are some extremely fine moments, such as when Georgina sees some wounded soldiers and realizes her playgirl life has to stop, and some extremely funny ones, as in the episode when the Bellamy's drawingroom is commandeered for a dreary charity event.

The class structure, the changes that came with the 1914-18 war, the entrenched attitudes that resisted the changes and the frustration felt by those bringing in the new ideas.  Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is also there and made me so sad that it was not recognised for what it was.  But the most beautiful thing about all these episodes is of course, the relationship between upstairs and downstairs.  It makes one aware that the boundaries of what we consider family can stretch and stretch.  The actors are superb and I wonder where they are now.  It is just a perfect slice of England and the English with all our prejudices and funny ways of doing things - stiff upper lip, public school - but everyone just muddles along and makes their way through all the turmoil.

For one thing, I'd never have been able to get through nursing school taking time to watch TV, and for another I'd never have lived through waiting for the next episode.  I'm way too much of an immediate needs gratification sort of person!!\n\nThe setting is a period to which I have become more and more attracted, the two decades between World War I and World War II.  Times are changing, but not necessarily for the better, or at least not for everyone.  The old guard is losing its hold over society, but those newly rising to power are not necessarily better than those who wielded it before.  If anything the old guard, based as it was on a landed aristocracy with a vested interest in England as a property, had reasons to keep things from falling totally apart for the middle and lower classes.  Their pride of place came as much from their perceived obligations as from their assets.  The rising nouveaux riche are vested in money alone, a portable commodity that can be invested wherever there is profit to be had.  Their focus is on who has the most of it; without ties to anything, they take no responsibility for the society that makes their fortunes.  Theirs were the ideals upon which our present world and its predicaments are based.\n\nThe characters of the series are reflections of the changing times.  The Upstairs family sees the pater familias, an aristocratic man of conservative principles, losing ground to the younger members of the family who are going through the emotional ravages of World War I.  They question everything and challenge many of the basic principles of social behavior, including the roles of women, political power and who should wield it, and the behavior of society during war.  Below stairs, too, there is disruption.  The younger generation questions the reasons for the demand for \"gratitude\" for their position of servitude and see the efforts of the butler to prevent their adopting new ideals as repressive and patronizing.  They question the need to ask the family they serve for permission to marry, to hold a war job, to question their additional work load without commensurate compensation.\n\nUpstairs Downstairs is a world in flux, much like our own, and the efforts of the extended family to adjust to it are absolutely mesmerizing.","summary":"Mesmerizing","unixReviewTime":1282003200,"vote":null,"image":null}

I guess they thought the show had been cancelled and they took the set apart already and got rid of it-- then they were called back for one more year-- so they had to slap together a new set!  This is also why Bob isn't always physically present in every episode-- he had booked other gigs when he thought his show had been cancelled-- so they had to make due without him.  Kind of a sad way for what was a really great show to go off-- But there you have it.

Creative and involving. Sean Connery delivers a great performance as Sir August DeWynter, an maniacal genius and former British Intelligence agent (?) with an axe to grind with the Royal Empire. He has stolen control of a satellite that allows him to control the weather everywhere on the planet. He is holding the world hostage and has a hefty ransom. So British super agent John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) is called into action to stop him, and he is first advised to bring in Dr. Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), a noble prize winning physicist and the number one suspected ally of DeWynter after video footage of her surfaces implicating her in the murder of a high ranking member of the British business community. After he brings her in to meet Mother and Father, they determine she is innocent. But if so, then who is the woman on the video? They decide to team up to get some answers, and start at the home of Sir August DeWynter, where they quickly discover who their enemy is. But he is ready for their every move, and has them both at his mercy in a hurry. But they also soon discover he has a friend on the inside who gave him vital information to help him steal the weather satellite. A mole in British Intelligence. But who? This a exciting and involving action film that has every bit of the charm and charisma of the popular 60's TV series, and all the gadgets as well. It gets a 90's update, of course, but still keeps true to the show at the same time. Thurman and Fiennes have great onscreen chemistry, and as I mentioned, Connery was awesome. The idea of him being a former British agent was a bit cheesy, but still worked well. Brief nudity and mild language are all parents will have to worry about. There's a ton of action and snappy banter, as well as tea. Their was no sequel, which I felt was unfortunate. It didn't exactly kill at the box office, which might be its only downfall. I found it enjoyable and fun.","summary":"The 60's go 90's in a good way (and Bond is a bad guy!)...","unixReviewTime":1425168000,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

That said, despite some fine moments, the show begins to look tired in this season. Right away, the Hartleys move -- but only to an apartment on a different floor! So nothing really is changed except the decor and some of the off-screen layout. Howard is still THERE all the time, which becomes more and more ridiculous (even the new title sequence seems to poke fun at this) and I swear he  was made dumber and dumber as the series went on, resulting by season six  in a Howard Borden man-child personna  who is no longer a believable adult character (this man is a navigator for an airline?!?).  The plotlines and stories seem a bit shop-worn and many episodes near the end of the run  just trail off without any big topper or clear resolution.  Finally, and most unforgivable, Bob seems to be literally phoning in his appearances to the point of hardly even showing up in many episodes. Was it a sarcastic message to viewers,  how often the token Bob Newhart scene in a host of episodes is him on the phone in an airport or hotel, checking in with Emily?  Three minutes of Bob doesn't even allow for a decent \"Hi, Bob\" drinking game!\n\nEven the finale is very abrupt and undeveloped, and then, that's all folks.  Kind of a wheeze-out for a show that in its prime was the sharpest written sit-com on television and still one of the best of all time.

Baldwin","reviewText":"In the Nineties it was fashionable for Hollywood to adapt popular television series for the big screen the best being \"The Fugitive\" and the very worst, in my mind, \"Lost In Space\".  There were high hopes riding on \"The Avengers\" in the Summer of 1998 with a dream cast of Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, and the iconic Sean Connery.  Things didn't bode well for the film when the film's release date kept getting pushed back.  Things looked even worse when the film wasn't even previewed for the critics and naturally the daggers were drawn when it was seen and the public followed suit.  I saw it in the theatre and was disappointed because it didn't meet my expectations.  But what were my expectations?  Is this a bad film because it isn't the film I thought it should be?  I don't know why I revisited \"The Avengers\" but I'm glad I did.  Common criticisms of the film at the time are these.  Fiennes as John Steed and Thurman as Emma Peel had no chemistry.  Connery as Sir August De Wynter was lackluster as the villain.  London, a bustling city, is oddly bereft of people.  Eddie Izzard as one of Connery's henchmen has no dialogue which is strange for a man who makes his living as a stand-up comic.  For the first two criticisms I'll say the critics are dead wrong.  For the second two I'll say that the makers of the film were making an ironic stab at comedy that may have gone over some people's heads.  Viewing this film unbiased by the criticisms at the time of it's release I'll say it's chief virtues are not only Fiennes, Thurman, and Connery but also terrific supporting work by Jim Broadbent, Fiona Shaw, and Eileen Atkins. Patrick MacNee also has a decent cameo.  The film has decent production values and special effects but they're secondary to some cheeky dialogue notably between Fiennes and Thurman.  It's rare that I do a 180 on a film but that's the case here.  This film may have its detractors but if you go into it with an open mind you may find delight in \"The Avengers\".","summary":"Time Is The Great Avenger","unixReviewTime":1346371200,"vote":12.0,"image":null}

Quite possibly the worst Uma Thurman has been involved in.  Rating it on its own merits, it's not that bad of a movie-- just kind of silly and dumb and totally forgettable.  Comparing it to the Peel-era shows is what makes this very hard to watch.  First of all, Uma Thurman looks nothing like Diana Rigg.  Jessica Biel would make a much better Emma Peel.  Secondly, this is set in modern day.  So much of Peel's persona has to do with how she twirls her flip or wearing those white gloves.  Without that hair and clothing goes much of the essence of Emma Peel.  Sealing the tomb is a barrage of crappo CGI which makes the whole thing look like the graphics on a fast food cup set to motion.  For a dumb film of a similar flavor which actually succeeds at being a comedy, just rent \"Austin Powers\".","summary":"3 stars average rating, really??","unixReviewTime":1336262400,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

Can you accept that Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman, as Steed and Peel, are not McNee and Riggs, and are not trying to imitate the TV actors? That, as with King Lear, different actors can bring different qualities, different interpretations, to a role? If you can, yes, get this movie. Fiennes is diffident, where McNee was suave. Thurman is titillating, where Rigg was provocative. Some of the movie is silly; so was some of the TV show. (And remember, The Avengers was picked up by US TV not because it was good, but because it was the 60s, it had spies - and it was cheaper than making a show in the States.)\n\nThis will never be the definitive The Avengers. But if you have an open mind, give it a look. Better (IMHO) than another couple of hours with another 'reality' show. Then, if you haven't, watch McNee and Rigg too.

And made poorly it is. The score is over-blown & barely fits within a scene, the dialogue is atrocious, the acting is embarrassing to all involved, the plot is convoluted as all get out, and there isn't a single genuinely good moment to be found.\n\nFirst off, tone. I've never been more baffled as to what the filmmakers were going for than I was with this film. It didn't really strike me as serious, but it never struck me as a comedy or a parody either, or even campy. I've never seen the TV series, but my god, I don't think it had people dressing up in Teddy bear costumes! That's right, Sean Connery, and a bunch of other people in a board room wear teddy bear suits. Why? So they don't know who each other is. Why teddy bear suits? I have no earthly idea. In a way, it's sort of charming in the way \"Toys\" was with Robin Williams and that crazy world, but any charm is zapped by the utter incomprehensibility injected scene, after scene, after painful scene. Sean Connery gets a cane stuck through him, then lightning comes down, zaps him, and then carries him up. Why didn't this lightning bolt strike before? I mean, Sean Connery had the cane with him the whole time.\n\nThen there's the casting. Forget the fact that this is basically Mr. Freeze with weather puns instead of ice puns, and it's being said by the great Sean Connery, the real offender of this film is Uma Thurman. Yes, Uma was in Batman & Robin also, so bad picking skills on her part, but my gosh is she miscast. The actress is from Boston, but the character is from England, and speaks in an English accent, and boy does it show. Oh wait, she also gets to fight her clone named \"Evil Peel,\" and gets to say the line, \"You just saved me from myself.\" Yes, that's actual dialogue from this movie. And that's one of the \"funnier\" lines. As for Ralph Fiennes, I don't believe he's actually in the film. It's actually Joseph in Ralph's face, because that's the quality he puts into this. Granted, his character basically gets to fight with umbrellas, drink tea, and speak in a polite British accent, but my gosh, put a little emotion into it!\n\nIt's rumored that 50 minutes was cut out of this film right before release, sacrificing a lot of the coherentness to make it a bad movie. Believe me, it was always a bad movie. There's no amount of extra scenes that could make this even a decent movie. It's at its core a bad film. What, are you going to have dialogue explaining why Steed & Peel come to Wynter's fortress in plastic bubbles? Are you going to have dialogue explaining the need to create mechanical bees? The list goes on and on, and in the end, it would have just prolonged the awfulness. As is, it's too long. So stay away from these Avengers at all costs, and go watch those other Avengers. God only knows that a bunch of superheros is more believable and entertaining than those British spies.","summary":"Rain or Shine, All is Mine!","unixReviewTime":1280361600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Unfortunately, a lot of scenes which were in the trailer were deleted from the film after what are rumored to be terrible test screenings, and in the end, we wind up with what looks like an action movie trailer for the real thing (please excuse me for using Ridley Scott's descrption of his own film \"Kingdom Of Heaven\" when talking about the Director's Cut). The original length of the movie is rumored to run aywhere from 115 minutes to 2\/1\/2 hours. Frankly, I LOVED the movie, but am left feeling cheated because the Director's Cut has not been released. Warner Bros. should plan to release it, as there is a fan base, however small, for this movie. Also, there's a narrative error caused by the editing down to 86-89 minutes-SPOILER AHEAD!!!-when infiltrating Sir August De Wynter's lair, how did the real Doctor Peel know the code words (\"How now, brown cow?\") to get into the lair with John Steed, as the line is not heard in the film prior to the scene?-SPOILER OVER!!! I enjoyed the acting of everyone involved, but felt that Sean Connery was underused (and, judging by the trailer and information on another site, most of his scenes ended up on the cutting room floor). SPOILER ALERT!!! Patrick Macnee's cameo was good. I guess the reason he chose not to appear on screen (and why Ms. Rigg turned down a cameo in the film) is because they didn't want the cameos to distract the audience from the plot of the movie. It also would have been nice to see Honor Blackman, another Bond Girl, appear in the film as well. Trivia: Patrick Macnee also appeared in a Bond film: \"A View To A Kill.\" PLEASE, somebody contact Warner Bros. & urge them to release the Director's Cut of this movie and the Director's Cut of\n\"Anna Karenina\" starring Sophie Marceau, Sean Bean, James Fox, Phyllida Law and Alfred Molina.

I suspect one reason there was a negative reaction to this film was because many people missed the original series. The original series was before my time, so I had nothing to miss so to speak.\n\nMoving on, the movie tries to create a 60s feeling, and to a great deal they succeed. We see John Steed gradually walk through a series of 'obstacles' to test his spy abilities. Uma Thurman and John Steed meet, and right away, we see that Uma Thurman does not always play by the established rules. We are lead to believe that Uma Thurman has sabotaged her own project, and of course we know that that is a little too obvious. So, Mrs Peel and John end up working together to find the real problem.\n\nWe then meet Sean Connery who carries some charm and is obviously very intelligent. But he shows his dark side as well. Moving on, we see that Connery's plan is to control the world with his weather controlling device. (Alright. A bit cliche. But this is a 60s recreation, so a bit of the cliche was probably inevitable.) Also worth mentioning is that all the nations of the government are fighting and bickering at the crucial moment and accomplishing nothing. Sean Connery walks in and announces his intentions to control the world. And of course they continue to argue and bicker uselessly. There is something utterly hilarious about how Sean Connery silences the politicians very simply: \"Oh...DO SHUT UP!\"\n\nI don't want to ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen it. But there is a nice 60s charm; there is the right amount of action; the right amount of story; and a nice amount of internal trouble where we should feel safe; and the comedy is well balanced too. And the final showdown between John Steed and Sean Connery is very well done. Also worth mentioning is that John Steed and Mrs Peel work together well without stomping over each other.\n\nAnother character I feel obliged to mention is 'Mother.' Rather than being the cliche behind the scenes man, he seems to know that things aren't always what they seem; he is open to reason and the finding of the truth; and when he discovers the truth, he tries to save Mrs. Peel, even though he is old and injured. It's also worth mentioning that at one point he refuses to believe that Steed and Peel have simply vanished, and he sends out a rescue party. (The kind, benevolent, open to reason boss, who knows when he has to face the danger. And just the right touch of being fatherly.)\n\nIf you are expecting the original series, you're probably going to be disappointed. But if you are willing to see this in its own light, it's really a nice film. Also a great way to have a 60s night!\n\nMy advice is to at least give it a chance.","summary":"At Least Give It A Chance","unixReviewTime":1251676800,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

It's not the catastrophe its often portrayed, but the studio only had themselves to blame for the over-reaction by violating the quid-pro-quo relationship with the press by not screening it for the critics, a public relations disaster that lead to many publications imposing a blacklist on articles about their films for months after and picking it as their turkey of the year.\n\nWarner Bros. 75th anniversary year was certainly not good one, with flop after flop turning their planned celebrations into commiserations. Perhaps in any other year there would have been less pressure on trying to turn an always optimistically surreal cult item into a blockbuster despite increasingly bad word of mouth, but by the time it emerged from lengthy post-production, the film was covered from head to toe in self-inflicted wounds. What had started out with a two-hour plus running time went to a 101-minute compromise cut to a released version that ran only 81 minutes without credits with Michael Kamen's original score replaced by a quickie effort from Joel McNeely as they tried to unsuccessfully make it more conventional to an audience unfamiliar with the series while alienating the original fans. It's just a surprise they didn't try to edit it down further to the length of a TV episode - even the troubled movie version of The Saint only lost its last 20 minutes. In the process they simply turned an interesting misfire into a much shorter, more confusing misfire and ended up with something too surreal for mainstream audiences, and too mainstream for Avengers fans. (The BFI was offered the chance to screen and preserve the original cut in 1999, but all too typically blew it by not bothering to return the studio's calls!)\n\nThe loss of the original (and heavily trailered) opening was certainly a huge mistake. Instead of seeing Mrs Peel (or is it?) breaking into and destroying a weather station, something that triggers the plot (a variation on both the original show's A Surfeit of H20 and Our Man Flint with a weather-controlling eccentric millionaire holding the world to ransom), the film now opens with Steed taking on policemen, milkmen and machine-gun toting nannies with only his bowler and brolly - an enjoyable enough introductory scene but not as essential to understanding what's going on. That's just the first of many plot holes the film is left with, but they're still the least of the film's problems.\n\nOn the plus side, Ralph Fiennes wisely doesn't attempt a Patrick McNee impersonation as Steed, opting for a more formal, slightly reserved approach that lacks Macnee's effortless bonhomie but works well enough on its own terms. Jim Broadbent makes a good `Mother' and Eileen Atkins (in a cameo originally intended for Diana Rigg) effortlessly steals her few scenes. But if they're all on good form, just about everyone else isn't. Indeed, there's miscasting on an epic scale here - Fiona Shaw overacting for England yet again as `Father,' Eddie Izzard exuding all the menace of a fluffy kitten and Uma Thurman delivering a turn bad enough to make you sorry they didn't cast Elizabeth Hurley as Mrs Peel instead. You feel almost sorry for her and wonder how she ever got another job after this - she can't do comedy, she can't do the accent, she can't do sophisticated, she can't do the banter and most of her action scenes hit the cutting room floor, which reduces her to not much more than a clotheshorse. That there's absolutely no chemistry between her and Fiennes is just another nail in the coffin.\n\nSadly it's a performance more than matched by what originally seemed the film's great casting coup. Sean Connery, once again showing the keen commercial instinct that led him to turn down X-Men, Lord of the Rings and The Mask of Zorro, gives a career-worst performance in his first role as a villain since 1959's Tarzan's Greatest Adventure and 1984's Sword of the Valiant. Looking like Windsor Davies playing a dirty old man but without the restraint, his introductory single-entendre scene with Thurman is painful to watch as she flounders and he mistimes every line - it's the kind of thing you'd expect in a Robbie Moffat film where amateur actors only get one take and it goes in the picture whether they fluff it or not. It cannot be stressed enough just how absolutely awful he is for much of the film, and considering how often Connery's double stood in for him Peter Sellers-style even on non-action scenes because of the star's feuds with the director and producer (shades of LXG) you find yourself wondering if his better moments may not even be him.\n\nThere's a lot about it that's good - the teddy bear scene is spot on and worthy of the original show while Patrick McNee's cameo non-appearance is fun - and a lot that isn't - Roger Pratt's dour photography overcompensates for the primary colors of Stuart Craig's production design and Anthony Powell's costumes. Yet while it's a mess that often stops making sense thanks to the unsubtle re-editing, it's still surprisingly watchable, with just enough moments that do work and give a hint of what could have been to keep you soldiering on through the patches that fall flat. It's just a shame we'll probably never see the film the way it was originally intended to judge it on its own merits rather than the studio's second-guessing.\n\nNot much in the way of extras here - just  a  trailer  and som e  text notes - though the disc does have an acceptable widescreen transfer.","summary":"Not a catastrophe but certainly a mess","unixReviewTime":1232755200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Crabtree","reviewText":"Prior to 1967, \"The Avengers\" was yielded in black-and-white. Going to color was a definite improvement; however in 1968 there were three additional significant changes:\n\n1. Mrs. Peel (Diana Rigg) was traded out for Steed's new partner, Tara King (Linda Thorson).\n\n2. The producers asserted that the 1968 episodes were more [paraphrasing] \"believable\" -- in fact, just the opposite is true. The '68 episodes are more bizarre than ever, but still very good.\n\n3. There is more involvement by Steed's boss, \"Mother\" (a wheelchair-bound chubby guy who shows up in very strange places to discuss Steed's progress on respective cases).\n\nThis DVD package, (2 DVDs, individually cased and further packaged in an attractive cardboard box, this \"Set No. 4\" color-coded RED), is the fourth of FIVE sets for the 1968 episodes. The marketing of \"The Avengers\" can be quite confusing so I wanted to get that information out up front. This is also the BEST way to buy the DVDs (by the \"set\" rather than by the \"volume\") for any season, from 1963 through 1968.\n\nPatrick Macnee shrewdly plays John Steed, England's gentleman undercover agent. Linda Thorson is one of several of a line of Steed's voluptuous sidekicks. In the U.S., most of us didn't even know about Honor Blackman and Macnee's other (earlier) partners until years later when these episodes finally emerged on VHS tape. Diana Rigg can probably claim about 60% of the credit for the vast number of U.S. audience members who were glued to their TVs when \"The Avengers\" finally hit here. The other 40% (not forgetting Macnee's fine performances) had to do with the presentation of this excellent series.\n\nStarting in 1965, with Rigg, the filmscore was notably updated and played more prominently throughout the story, enhancing the action and suspense. Also, the action itself was boosted. There was never a dull moment with Steed and Mrs. Peel. And these episodes were all FUN -- one embraced a sense that Macnee and Rigg were having a great time in making these films. Now that I've seen episodes from \"The Avengers'\" earlier years, ('63 and '64), I can see that they dragged quite a bit during that earlier era and were much more soap opera-ish. The fun continued throughout the final year, 1968, even though Linda Thorson was simply never quite as dynamic or as sexy as Diana Rigg. The '68 filmscore and title scenes at the beginning and the conclusion of each episode were spiffed up a bit too.\n\nEach of these 52-minute episodes is futuristic (at least for the period) and on the cutting edge of excellent television productions. I know of no series, \"The Original Star Trek Series\" excepted, which has remained as timeless as \"The Avengers\". You'll encounter, in the 1968 episodes, every nemesis ranging from Eastern spies posing as murderous British Army officers to equally murderous hotel desk clerks.\n\nIn the 1968 Set No. 4 (which includes Vols. 7 and 8), we're talking about seven very enjoyable, action-packed, color episodes:\n\nVolume 7:\n\n\"Wish You Were Here\" - In a parody of \"The Prisoner\" Tara attempts to free her uncle from a hotel which has a firm \"no check-out early\" policy. This is a superb episode.\n\n\"Stay Tuned\" - Investigating Steed's amnesia (a returning theme from previous years), Steed and Tara uncover a plot to kill their boss, \"Mother\".\n\n\"Take Me To Your Leader\" - A briefcase stuffed with money and a bomb seems to have a mind of its own - and it's giving strange orders.\n\nVolume 8:\n\n\"Fog\" - When foreign committee members arrive in London for a meeting, they find themselves stalked by the \"Gaslight Ghoul,\" a Victorian killer with a modern motive.\n\n\"Homicide and Old Lace\" - On his birthday, Mother tells tales of an older adventure. The flashback scenes were originally filmed for the never-aired episode, \"The Great Britain Crime\".\n\n\"Love All\" - The missile department is leaking secrets but Steed and Tara sniff out the source of the indiscretion. A terrific episode.\n\n\"Get-A-Way\" - A prison is having trouble holding enemy agents. The first two escapees knock off Steed's pals... is he the next on the list?\n\nThe storylines of the various \"The Avengers\" episodes seem absurd to varying degrees as we view them today - but 1968 continued to escalate the absurdity beyond the previous years' entries. This did not diminish my enthusiasm for the \"The Avengers\" because the overall series always manifested a \"Batman\" (TV series) tongue-and-cheekness about it. I mention this only to prepare viewers for this actuality.\n\nThe casting in all episodes is spot-on, punctuated with the very best sets and scenic locations. And Linda Thorson's astounding beauty (tenoned with her great figure!) really accentuates the `60s look in her mod attire.\n\nI'll be reviewing all of the 1968 sets, (as I mentioned earlier, there are five in all, with 2 \"volumes\" per set), so be on the watch for my comments regarding the other sets at their appropriate sites on Amazon. In the meantime, while not exactly as marvelous as the 1967 episodes, this particular set still garners my highest recommendation!","summary":"More of beautiful Linda Thorson!

Sure it was campy but it was fun to watch. This movie is no such luck. It was doomed from the minute the director screamed action. The whole plot involves some asinine scheme by August De Wynter(played by Sean Connery) to control the world weather. The British secret service assign Emma Peel(Uma Thurman) and John Steed(Ralph Fiennes) to the case. The story also involves plot twist where one of the head of the secret service(affectionately called \"Mother\") is in cahoots with Sir Wynter. When you're not laughing at the cheesy dialogue, you cracking up at the hackneyed fight scenes and the overacting by Sean Connery, who seems to have more fun chewing up scenery even though he advised people not to watch it. The chemistry between Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman is non-existent. The mechanical bees and the teddy bear costumes...nice. This movie wasn't pre-screened for a reason and Sean Connery did warn people not to see this movie. You can put two and two together and see the outcome. People overact like its going out of style, the humor is on par with those Roger Moore James Bond flicks and the premise is pretty juvenile.

It was campy, perfectly synchronized with the oddities of 1960s design, worldview, and style, and told good, short stories.  It was a wonderful world unto itself.\n\nBy contrast, this film tries for camp without synching with the times, for an old-fashioned chemistry that it traduces (Emma and Steed had wonderful sexual tension, but everything else was implied, never shown), and for a weird yet believable story.  But it fails utterly.\n\nThis film is so bad that it is like making a comic book version of a comic book.  Not only do Fiennis and THurman utterly lack chemistry, in spite of their great talent, but the plot is simply and stupidly unbelievable.  I think that this is the worst tv-remake I have ever seen.  That answers the question:  you shouldn't try to exploit perfection by slapping together a stupid film.\n\nNot recommended.

The bear suit was not his finest hour...although pretty funny.\n\n And I also have to wonder just why when casting this, the \"supporting\" role of henchman (with no lines) was given to a stand up comedian, Eddie Izzard. Known for being a non-stop talker. But of course for the one and only cuss word for the whole movie...and I swear that it's not Eddie Izzard's voice in the first place, just a dubded in word.\n\n So finely, this movie does get a star because the location shots are not bad.

I was curious see if the movie still came across as bad to me as it did when I originally saw it theatrically. Did it??? Please continue reading......\n\nOn the surface, The Avengers seemed to have all the required ingredients for a surefire summer blockbuster. You had plenty of star power in the form of Sean Connery, Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes. There was a 60 million dollar budget to spend and the movie was based on a 60's cult british secret agent series of the same name that had a dedicated and pretty sizable cult following. You also had Uma Thurman strutting around in an extremely tight leather body suit. Everything seemed initially in place to deliver an updated 90's theatrical version that could have been a cool\/fun alternative to the James Bond films. But what ended up in theaters was the biggest bomb of the summer of 1998 (and of the whole year for that matter) and one of the worst films ever released by a major studio.\n\nIn its theatrical form, The Avengers was a jumbled, murky and incoherent mess that made hardly any sense no matter how hard you tried to figure out what exactly was going on. My friends and I saw it for free back in 1998 despite the fact that it had not been screened for critics (always a terrible sign) and left the theater with a very bad headache, wondering what in the hell we had just been subjected to. The worst sin that this movie commited was that besides the bizarre teddy-bear costumes (I'll get back to those later on!) this movie isn't even enjoyable on a so-bad-it's-good level.\n\nThe basic plot involves, more or less, an evil madman called Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) who has built a new weather-controlling device. The British government who has been watching his actions for quite some time. They send two of their secret agents, John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), to investigate what Sir August is up to and to thwart whatever attempts that he is making for world domination.\n\nAfter the initial introductions to the two secret agents, they begin to check out Sir August's true plans and wherabouts. The movie quickly turns into a series of badly edited action scenes that fall flat every time and a series of scenes that literally make no sense at all in the grand scheme of things.\n\nA perfect example is when John and Emma are traveling in their souped up car near the beginning (complete with a mini-coffee maker\/bar), they are suddenly chased by giant remote control robotic bees. They eventually git rid of the pests, but after exiting their car it explodes for literally no reason at all. One of our first glimpses of Sir August involves a sort of meeting with some people to show off his new weather-control device. For some inexplicable reason, everyone is wearing giant multi-colored teddy-bear costumes! It truly must be seen to believed and if the rest of the movie had been as over-the-top and campy as this scene it would have been entertaining on a purely guilty pleasure level. But unfortunately, the rest of the film has the same flat and lifeless feel to it that the opening scenes exhibit.\n\nThere's also a completely unexplained subplot involving a clone of Uma Thurman running around that culminates with the real and fake Uma's batteling it out in a poorly choreographed fight in a very slow moving hot air balloon. Actually, that's this movie's biggest problem. Almost everything that happens seems unfinished and unexplained. There are some huge gaps in logic that will surely have any unsuspecting viewer screaming for someone to cut it off.\n\nI read a while back that the original rough-cut of the movie that was test-screened with disasterous results was a little under 2 1\/2 hours. Warner Bros. then demanded that the filmmakers cut the film down considerably, which they grudgingly obliged. The producers stated that the revised cut they turned in came in at 101 minutes with credits and they were actually happy with that cut. But Warner Bros. then proceeded to cut an additional 12 minutes from the film and the result was 89 minutes of terrible action scenes and no plot and logic. Do I think that the original cut would be better? It might certainly make considerably more sense, but the movie would still be awful due to some huge problems.\n\nThe acting all around is atrocious. Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever. Ralph is stoic and just looks bored. Uma goes through the movie in a variety of tight outfits (including the previously mentioned leather body suit), but her efforts at a believable british accent are laughable. She tries her best but it is very evident that she was not comfortable with her role and the script in any way. The rest of the cast just seems embarassed to be in this movie.\n\nThe film will probably gain some sort of cult status based purely on Sean Connery's over-the-top yet terrible performance. I thought that his efforts came across as way too forced and I've always wondered if he did this movie just to pay some back-taxes or a sizable poker debt. He's been in some bad movies before, but he's still managed to turn in a solid performance (Medicine Man and Entrapment for instance). But in this movie, he's just awful in every respect.\n\nSpecial effects are laughable throughout with some particularly hilarious matte and model work during the film's climax involving a hot air balloon traveling at about 5 miles an hour and some awful CGI tornadoes tearing up an equally bad replica of London. The final battle between Ralph and Sean is also very reminiscent of Highlander 2 for some reason (in terms of how bad it is choreographed and edited).\n\nI'm not sure what Warner Bros. was thinking with this one. But then again, they did the exact same thing with 1999's equally terrible Wild Wild West (which at least made back most of its budget). While I haven't seen many of the original 60's episodes that this was based, it initially seemed that this had some great potential to be a fun little secret-agent\/spy movie, but the execution was botched from all angles. It is clear that everyone involved was hoping for an alternative to the James Bond franchise, but this movie immediately squashed any chance of that. The marketing campaign seemed to focus on Uma Thurman in that tight leather body suit, but even that isn't enough to recommend sitting through this migraine inducing disaster.\n\n(On the DVD front, I'm surprised that Warner Bros. didn't include the ton of cut footage from the original version as deleted scenes. It would have really helped to shed some light on what went wrong with this movie. Much to my surprise, there is actually a cult following for this film that have been petitioning Warner Bros. for quite some time to release the original 2 1\/2 version, or at the very least the second 101 minute producer's cut. It's scary to think that some people actually liked this movie!)\n\nThe Avengers is rated PG-13 and contains violence and language.","summary":"Terrible in every way.","unixReviewTime":1130976000,"vote":19.0,"image":null}

The tv shows' wonderful theme by Laurie Johnson is used quietly in a couple of scenes, but the main theme is another one of those preprogrammed pieces of musical nothingness.  Uma Thurman acted like she was on Prozac and Ralph Fiennes looked like he was a little boy playing like he was John Steed. And Sean, what a lousy performance..you know you could have done better.  I did like the mechanical bees sequence; the only true original touch in the movie.

Granted, the superfeminine Diana Rigg isn't playing Mrs. Peel...and yes, dapper, veddy British Patrick McNee isn't parlaying Steed, but they did pretty well with what they had, and had a plotline that you were actually able to FOLLOW, to boot! This is something I remember the TV show NOT having...most of the stories were just platforms for Emma to be stylish in, with no clues, no O. Henry, no real DISCERNIBLE plot thread to speak of...just the barest of storylines....\n\nThe story involves Steed first MEETING Emma, (again!) and Emma being a major renaissance woman...doctor, meteorologist, psychologist, etc....the woman holds more degrees than a Kelvin thermometer!! The film opens up with Steed being tested for reflexes and skills as he strolls through a mockup of a British village. Pram-pushing nannies throw knives, pub drinkers try to run him over, bobbies attack him unbidden...he comes through with flying colors. Switch to Emma Peel's fabulous flat in London...she gets the call from the elite arm of the BSS that Steed works for after it's discovered that she, or a double of her, has sabotaged her own project.\n\nWhat follows are chase scenes from hell; some VERY mannered acting; Sean Connery chewing the scenery as a megalomaniac meteorologist and businessman who wants to, what else, RULE THE WORLD...by controlling the weather. Steed and Emma go after him when it's discovered, unequivocally, that it IS a double of Emma sabotaging her project...and in fact, attempting to kill the original Mrs. Peel!\n\nThe cinematography and art direction for this film is EXCELLENT. The music, however, except for the lifts from the series, seems somewhat inappropriate and overly ponderous. There are some hair-raising chase scenes in the film, one with a fleet of mechanical, anti-personnel hornets, and Connery's acting is perfect for his role. The style of the series is recaptured nicely, especially with the villians' confab scene in teddy bear mufti in the middle of the film, and Emma wandering through what looks like M.C. Escher's summer home.\n\nAll in all, the phlegmatic bearing of Fiennes and Thurman in the face of it all remind you an AWFUL lot of the original Steed and Emma, and the climax between Steed, Emma, Connery, Eddie Izzard, Fiona Shaw, as the very teutonic-looking \"Father\", (supposedly one of the GOOD guys,) and Connery's henchmen is fairly entertaining.\n\nWhile it may never win a spot on AFI's top 100, it IS diverting. My one complaint is...why did they have to pick UMA THURMAN...Ms. Box Office Poison herself, to play Emma? Was Nicole Kidman busy? Emma Thompson? Miranda Richardson? WHY A YANK??!!

This requires a bit of historical perspective. Britain in the early\/mid-1960s was a culture in which long-accepted norms were threatened by powerful social forces. The youth movement was forever redefining attitudes toward authority and government, Britain was birthing a type of music that would soon sweep the world, and, particularly important to The Avengers, the women's rights movement saw many a woman demand more from her future than a lifetime of housewifedom.\n\nWhen Diana Rigg's character of Emma Peel was first introduced to The Avengers in 1965, the show had already been going for several years. The character of John Steed was well-established as a conservative, stiff upper lipped, tea drinking, bowler hatted, ex-military, prime example of upper crust middle-aged traditional British masculinity. Then along came his new partner Emma Peel: young, irreverent and outspoken, sexually aggressive, dressed in provocative mod fashion AND possessed of four doctorates. Bear in mind, at this time in Britain it was almost unheard of for a woman to be a doctor at all. Not only did Emma Peel defy that convention, she did it times four.\n\nTo John Steed, exemplar of the-way-things-are-and-should-be, Emma Peel was the living embodiment of forces threatening to destroy everything he held dear, everything to which he'd devoted his life, his duty, his sacred honor. To Peel, Steed was the sort of hidebound reactionary she'd been fighting against her entire life in order to be the sort of woman, the sort of whole person her sense of individuality demanded. The great thing about the John Steed\/Emma Peel Avengers episodes was watching these two very different people, each representing social forces the other had every reason to despise, over time learn to value and respect what the other had to offer, eventually even to love each other. An endless source of debate among Avengers TV fans is whether or not Steed and Peel's relationship ever became sexual or was simply platonic. Whichever opinion you embrace, there can be no doubt the love and respect were there.\n\nThe Avengers TV show was profoundly fortunate in its casting of John Steed and Emma Peel. Patrick Macnee perfectly portrayed the somewhat stuffy, exceedingly proper man of action. The heart of a noble knight in a three-piece suit and bowler hat. But as good as Macnee was, Diana Rigg's casting as Emma Peel was the masterstroke. For Emma Peel to accomplish everything she had in life before ever meeting John Steed, she must have been a high-level genius. Fortunately for the show, in real life Diana Rigg has an IQ that looks like a zip code, as well as immense class, polish, sex appeal, a strong will, and the thespic skills of a successful Shakespearean actress. When Diana Rigg played a high-level genius with multiple doctorates it was believable. I can't imagine anyone else who could have portrayed Emma Peel so well.\n\nSo that's why the original Steed\/Peel episodes of The Avengers rocked. And that's why the movie is a failure, because it has none of that going for it. It could be argued the social milieu within which the TV series existed, that provoked and informed its subtext, no longer exists and so the movie couldn't have used it anyway. Maybe. But I see no evidence the moviemakers were even aware of it. The props are there, the surface accoutrements, Steed's umbrella and bowler hat, Peel's catsuit, but the conflicts and dynamic that drove the original relationship and made it something truly special are nowhere to be found.\n\nThe casting in a problem. Ralph Fiennes tries hard but is hideously miscast. He's too young, too contemporary looking, to portray a rock-ribbed conservative like John Steed. Uma Thurman, though I respect her as an actress, was similarly a poor choice to play Emma Peel. From watching Uma Thurman in interviews I get a sense of her as an intelligent, thoughtful human being, but she simply can't convincingly portray a high-level genius like Emma Peel. Thurman's Peel is more coquettish than intellectual. When Diana Rigg says she has four doctorates you buy it. When Uma Thurman says the same thing, you can't.\n\nThere are other reasons to dislike this movie, but none as important as those just discussed. A great television show does not necessarily translate to a great movie when those making the latter fail to understand what made the former great, and the two leading roles are horribly miscast. If you want to enjoy The Avengers, check out the Patrick Macnee\/Diana Rigg originals, and give this turkey a pass.","summary":"Great TV Show, Lousy Movie","unixReviewTime":1090627200,"vote":18.0,"image":null}

The genius of Paul Taylor and Director Matthew Diamond combine to make an extraordinary documentary.\nThe first thing which struck me was the spontaneity with which Mr. Taylor was shown creating one of his new works.  Standing side-by-side with one of his dancers, the two just ... moved ... and then conjectured about what might go next:  \"you could start this way ... and then, maybe ...\"  Very interesting.  While there is a generous offering of studio footage, the recurring stereotype of the intensely driven dancemaster imploring his subjects to understand the gravity of his holy creation (you've seen this in movies) does not exist in this film.  No cinematic exaggeration here:  it's just the truest depiction of what happens as dance is created.  In reality, the emotion and interaction between Mr. Taylor and his dancers is often more characteristic of a family than of a teacher\/student relationship.\nAside from following people around, Mr. Diamond's camera gets to many places I've never seen before.  I loved the views from the wings in the opening sequence (\"Esplanade\"), and also during the performance in India when the sound system went dead and the crew was trying not to be frantic during the silence (the dancers continued on without missing a step until the sound was restored!).  I also got a kick out of the dancer in his hotel room explaining what he had to go through to wake up after a night of performing.\nThe film highlights two dance pieces, \"Aureole\" and \"Piazzolla Caldera,\" and even though they aren't seen in their entirety, there is no diminishment in their strength and beauty.  Mr. Diamond, who has also directed episodes of PBS's \"Great Performances,\" was adept at interspersing the contrasting performance film (color) with studio footage (black and white) so that the two meshed perfectly.  The editing during the dance numbers was the best I've ever seen, incorporating both the more typical audience vantage point with the more dramatic on-stage perspective from amongst the dancers.  The proximity and the viewing angles were stunning; a wonderful surprise.  There's also a fair amount of footage from the Paul Taylor Dance Archives, showing a younger Mr. Taylor and company performing signature works.\nIn maintaining the foundation of a storyline, the film incorporates a biographical aspect, showing the evolution of Mr. Taylor's role as a dancemaker as an outgrowth of his boyhood years.  The interviews with his long-time friends and associates, as well as the words of Mr. Taylor himself, are proof of the depth and seriousness with which he reveres his art.  The film also touches on the troubling business realities that weigh on dance companies:  having to remain financially solvent, and dealing with the picket lines which materialized in New York after the company hired non-union musicians.  There's even a scene involving the firing of one of his dancers (\"I just didn't want to work with her\"), a somber sequence of dialogues, but one which lends strength to the reality of this film.\nAs far as DVD features go, nothing extraordinary, but lots to read about the \"inspirations and interpretations\" behind the dances, biographies of selected dancers, and a scrolling list of the company's complete repertory (through 1999).\nOverall, this film's portrayal of the ways in which modern dance is created and portrayed make this a DVD I'd recommend to anyone.  Every minute was fascinating.","summary":"Superb; dancemaker and filmmaker choreograph wonderfully","unixReviewTime":1028246400,"vote":23.0,"image":null}

Houser","reviewText":"This film is more than a portrait of a choreographer. It is a portrait of his company. And of the small, not-for-profit arts institution in America. From beginning to end the viewer gets a glimpse of what it takes for such an institution to survive and remain creative in an environment that doesn't always appreciate innovation and creativity. Director Matthew Diamond (himself a former dancer and choreographer) has done an excellent job of interweaving rehearsal and live performances with archival footage and talking heads (dance critics, administrative staff, technical crew, dancers, former dancers, and Taylor himself all get their say). Taylor comes across, in turns, as impish (fabricating stories to please the press), vague (struggling to communicate new steps to his dancers), nervous (constantly chewing gum), fearful (\"my inspiration comes from fear\"), and autocratic (in the course of the film he fires one of his dancers). But most of all, Taylor comes across as insecure and vulnerable. One especially telling moment in the film comes when the company is performing in India and the sound system fails. The dancers continue dancing in silence while the crew busies itself trying to fix the problem. The music comes back on and the company is in perfect sync. Taylor revealingly says, \"My dance was ruined. And they were the heroes, not me. They stole the show.\" As one former company member put it when describing Taylor's origins: \"There was [Martha] Graham and then there was this big dysfunctional family, and Paul Taylor was one of them....And they all brought their own dysfunction to their own companies.\"\nThe director should be applauded for the way he avoided dance cliches and dull, straight-on filming of dance performances. Especially exciting was the from-the-wings view of the energetic \"Esplanade\" that opens the film. And the most entrancing sequence is the male solo from \"Aureole.\" For this, Diamond has intercut a current rehearsal of Patrick Corbin learning the dance with three different archival versions of Taylor performing the same work.

Watch it and simply stare in awe at how terrible it really is.  Hollywood still hasn't got the hint that you do not make movies out of old tv shows.

Because it is so bad that it actually becomes amusing, unlike Charlie's Angels or Starsky & Hutch which are just plain bad with no amusement at all.  My fascination with the Avengers is just wondering A.) What was the director thinking?  B). What were the stars thinking when they signed on for this film?  The director must be a terrific salesman, coz I don't think Sean Connery is a moron.  C).  Who gave the stamp of approval that allowed this film to be released into our neighborhood theaters?  I mean, this film had to be viewed and approved by the producers.  It was probably shown to a test audience.  How did it slip through all these cracks and make it's way out?  I think of these things as I watch this film.  You wanna see Sean Connery and his band of criminals dressed as giant teddy bears?  You wanna see America's rather shallow view of the English?(tea dispenser in car, lame attempts at British dry humor)  You want to see ZERO chemistry between the leading man and woman?  You wanna see an invisible man?  You wanna see Ralph Fiennes, normally a very good actor, trying to be cool, but actually looking and acting like a total schmuck(this goes for Uma as well)? Wanna see some of the most unexciting action sequences ever filmed?  You wanna see a 90 minute film that feels like twice the length?

Plus, he looks absolutely smashing with that suit and bowler hat.\nUma Thurman is no Diana Rigg, but does make the role of Emma Peel her own in this film with beauty and grace.  And I thought the chemistry between her and Fiennes was excellent.\nI think Sean Connery relished playing an over-the-top diabolical mastermind in this film, and you can see that he was just having a ball.\nThe special effects are awesome, and I think this film could very well be a cult classic, just as long as it isn't compared with the orignal series.

The original Avengers never shied away from the occasional flagrant pun or creating wonderful, almost comic book quality characters.  However, in this film, the plot meanders. Ralph Fiennes has no comic ability, and the lovely and talented Uma Thurman pretty much sleepwalks through movie. These is no trace of the quirky style that made the Avengers so special. To those of us who have seen the TV series, it comes as little surprise that several of the original program's directors went on to success in the big screen . I doubt that anyone associated with this film will find that it leads to more career opportunities. The chemistry between Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee was always a delight to watch. Sadly in the film, Fienes looks uncomfortable, and Thurman looks bored.\nThis is a poorly conceived, uninspired waste of film.

The line that best describes this movie came from another reviewer (can't remember who):\n\"Not only does The Avengers make you think that the filmmakers never MADE a movie before, it makes you think they've never even SEEN a movie before.\"\nThat about sums it up. The film has a temporal problem - it's a 90's movie that's a remake of a 60's tv show and it's not entirely sure what decade it's in. It looks kind of 60s-ish then it looks kind of like it's taking place in modern times. The generic 60's English thugs with the mod haircuts look like they've been on ice for a few decades.\nSean Connery is pretty much wasted in the title role. He's blustery and over the top, but it's mostly a great sound and fury signifying nothing. Connery's not nearly as wasted as Ralph Finnes (excellent in Strange Days). Uma Thurman shows that she can't hold a candle to Diana Rigg. She ends up in the leather catsuit but doesn't have much to do once she's in it.\nThere are some odd bits in the middle where the movie gives a nod to some of the more mind-twisting elements of the series, but with no real effect. The cgi killer-robot bees are at best laughable and at worst downright embarrasing.\nThe final mano-a-mano battle royal at then end is  pretty forgettable.","summary":"One of the worst movies ever made.

Sean Connery stars as Sir August de Wynter, an evil scientist who plans to threaten the world with his hi-tech weather machine which produces such phenomena as tornadoes, hail storms, extreme temperatures, and mechanical insects for good measure.  He makes his intentions known to world leaders and tells them that they must \"purchase\" their weather from him at a very hefty price.\nEnter our two heroes, John Steed, played by Ralph Fiennes, and Mrs. Peel, played by Uma Thurman.  Steed is a Bond-like special agent working for a British counter-intelligence agency.  He and his partner Mrs. Peel have been assigned to destroy De Wynter.  Uma Thurman is excellent in her role.  From her high speed driving skills to her cat-like climbing reflexes, she's the perfect counterpart to Steed's intellect and no-nonsense approach.\nThe special effects were the high point of the film, especially the spectacular weather effects.  The tornadoes and hail storms looked very realistic, and the final battle between Steed and De Wynter is astounding.  I enjoyed this movie for several reasons.  The special effects were the main one, but the rapport between Steed and Mrs. Peel was excellent.  The two clicked throughout the film, and Steed's continuous snide but light-hearted comments made the move that much more enjoyable.

I was so disappointed by this film (especially since I invited a group of friends out to see it).  There's got to be a story behind how this movie self-destructed.\nAnd it's too bad, because, when it came out, THE AVENGERS could've out-sluethed both Austin Powers and James Bond.  It could have had the bizarre Avengers flair with the 007 intrigue and thrills.\nPersonally, I thought Uma Thurman was a mistake as Mrs. Peel, only because the built-in audience (those familiar with the popular British TV show) would've expected an English girl.\nRalph Fiennes is a great choice and Sean Connery should have been the ultimate villian.\nBut the movie is incomprehensible.\nI'd read that the director was relatively new, having directed only a couple of small, independent films.  Was he overwhelmed by the massive production or did the studio take it away from him to cut it to pieces?  What makes me wonder if it was the former is that Sean Connery's first scenes have him talking with weird, exaggerated tics and such--and then they're gone.  Connery just walks through the rest of the film.  I've always heard that Connery did not suffer fools on a movie set: did he turn on his young director?\nI've read the script (which is available online) and I'm still wondering just what in the world happened to this film.\n\"Mrs. Peel, we STILL need you!\"","summary":"\"Mrs. Peel, we're STILL needed....\"","unixReviewTime":1034812800,"vote":null,"image":null}

This movie has style, yet the backdrop is a special effects surreal dream. If you love storms moving in on a beach, rainy days or just gothic style weather, this is for you.\n\nWhile drinking tea most often, these two secret agents fight crime in style while resisting the impulse to drown in more than a hands-off sexual chemistry. I could watch these two play mind games for hours. In one scene John Steed is discussing Dr. Emma Peel's profile and states:\n\n\"After all, according to your file you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia, based on traumatic oppression leading to outbursts of antisocial and violent behavior.\"\n\nThen, he states that she is just his style. Of course, she is not the type of woman he needs to save from herself or anyone else for that fact and more than likely he is describing the other Mrs. Peel who seems much more violent. This Mrs. Peel can take care of herself, thank you very much.\n\nSo, what is the diabolic plan they must thwart?  Ah, yes....the evil aristocrat, Sir August DeWynter. He plans to threaten the world with his fantastic high-tech weather machine. He is capable of threatening mankind with raging ice storms, scorching temperatures and mechanical insects. The special effects in regards to the weather are seamless and spectacular.\n\nThe script is delicious, the chemistry drips over the edge of the mind into a pool of absolute surging tension and visually, The Avengers is very compelling.

I am old enough to have seen the original TV series the first time around and while I remember it fondly, it was definitely a product of its time. What makes this film so enjoyable for me is that it is not merely trying to copy the old series but to reinvent it. Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are John Steed and Emma Peel this time around. No they aren't Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg nor should they try to be. They have created their own version of the characters and they work quite well together. Their overwritten dialogue is overplayed with just the proper restraint. Sean Connery as Sir August, the principal villian, seems to be underplaying his role until you notice his eyes. Watch the eyes of all the characters. They are an important motif throughout the movie. Jim Broadbent's liquid eyes as \"Mother\" are full of knowledge and sympathy while Fiona Shaw's traitorous \"Father\" is literally blind to everything. Patrick Macnee (the original John Steed) has an important cameo as an invisible man. He holds the key to the mystery but he cannot be seen.\n\nDirector Jeremiah Chechik (BENNY AND JOON) has created a modern day fairy tale out of the old series while retaining the droll humor and the surreal touches (the brightly colored teddy bears are a good example). Much of the look of the film resembles the illustrations of modern day children's books especially THE POLAR EXPRESS. My only real complaint with the film is Eddie Izzard's use of the f-word. It is totally out of character with the rest of the film and was added solely to get a PG-13 rating. I was hoping the DVD would include the missing footage cut from the film before its release but no cigar. Sources close to the film say that it would clarify a number of points including the two Mrs Peels. Perhaps we will see it in a future reissue. So for the meantime put away your preconceived baggage and try and take the film on its own terms and you may be pleasantly surprised as I was. After all seeing is believing.

Even with the considerable talents of Sean Connery, Uma Thurman and Ralph Finnes, this film is just about unwatchable. Poorly edited, poorly scripted and badly directed, films like this are what make movie goers shudder whenever a studio announces they are bringing a beloved TV series to the big screen. For every adaptation like The Fugitive, there are dozens of bombs like My Favorite Martian, The Mod Squad and this dud.\nI am actually one of the few unlucky people to actually see this \"film\" in the theater. I fell asleep. So just to be fair and to have a complete impression of the film, I rented the DVD. I fell asleep twice more before I saw the entire film. It was so bad it made me wish I had fallen asleep a third time.\nWhat makes my dislike of this film so disappointing is that I so wanted to enjoy it. Sean Connery is one of my favorite actors and I was looking forward to seeing him as a villan. Uma Thurman is one of the sexiest women in movies today and I wanted to see her take on Diana Rigg's Mrs. Peel. And Ralph Finnes has been in several of my favorite films, including Schindler's List and Quiz Show. However, they all fall flat in this film (although Thurman looks great in her Mrs. Peel leather outfit).\nThe film tries to recapture the odd flavor of the series (the Connery board meeting in which all the participants are dressed as teddy bears, for example), but falls flat every time. Finnes is miscast as John Steed (too young) and he and Thurman have none of the chemistry that Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee had in the original series.\nDo yourself a favor. Instead of buying this waste of precious natural resources, buy the DVD set of the Emma Peel episodes of the original series.

In addition, although the video quality isn't of high-definition quality, the episodes are eminently watchable.  All problematic issues were soon forgotten after I started watching the show.  Bob Newhart was one of the first successful stand-up comedians to star in a TV sitcom.  That started a trend that continued with Tim Allen, Ray Romano, Jerry Seinfeld, and many others.  In addition, the show was not cancelled by CBS because of poor ratings.  After six successful seasons, Bob decided that is was time to end the series.  The writing on the show perfectly suited Bob's personality and comedic style.  The casting choices were uniformly excellent, especially with Suzanne Pleshette as Bob's wife Emily.  Special mention must be made of Jack Riley as Bob's patient Elliot Carlin, who appeared in 56 of the 142 episodes.  To say that he is an unforgettable character is an understatement.  The box set also includes an informative booklet, which gives a brief synopsis of each episode, along with its original airdate.\n\nWhat really makes this box set special are the bonus features.  Audio commentary is provided on several episodes.  The bonus disc includes the original, unaired pilot.  In it, Peter Bonerz plays Dr. Jerry Robinson as another psychologist, instead of an orthodontist.  Marcia Wallace does not appear as secretary Carol Kester, nor does Bill Daily appear as nutty navigator and neighbor Howard Borden.  The 19th Anniversary special is also included.  It takes place on the day after Bob had a dream about being a Vermont innkeeper named Dick Loudon.  The most surreal moment of the special is when they show a clip of Bill Daily as Major Roger Healey on the \"I Dream Of Jeannie\" TV series.  The bonus disc also includes \"Group Therapy,\" which was recorded in Los Angeles in December of 2013.  It's a nostalgic discussion of the show with Bob Newhart, Peter Bonerz, Bill Daily, Jack Riley, and director Michael Zinberg.  Sadly, Suzanne Pleshette and Marcia Wallace had both passed away, and are sorely missed in the discussion group.  Bob and Bill do show their age, while Peter has held up well.  Sadly, Jack Riley had a stroke, and is confined to a motorized wheelchair.  This look back to when they were all in their prime is bittersweet, as time has taken its toll on all of the participants.

I think Ralph Fiennes is a fine actor and whats more I'm Scottish and as is the custom if you're Scottish, I'm one of Sir Sean Connery's greatest fans. He was the best Bond (although Pierce Brosnan's doing a fine job) and great in movies such as The Hill, The Untouchables (even if the accent was a bit ropey), The Hunt For Red October, The Rock, Outland etc. He is a fine ambassador for his nation and the world's greatest living Scotsman by popular acclaim BUT what were you thinking Sir Sean when you made this pile of poo? Didn't you read the script? Or were you too busy banking the cheque?\nThis movie stinks. Not because a remake of the sixties TV series was a bad idea because it wasn't. Not because the movie didn't have potential because it did. Not because the series had a cult following and the movie had a ready made audience to tap into. No it stinks because it boasts one of the worst scripts ever, with plot-holes you could drive a car through, poor editing, poor special effects, a really (...) supporting performance from Eddie Izzard and perhaps the worst choreographed and directed action scenes you could ever see. Take a bow Mr Jeremiah Chechick (also director of the fine Benny and Joon and the awful National Lampoons Christmas Vacation). The movie also boasts a fine English accent from Uma Thurman but a truly awful acting display not just from her but an incredibly wooden and uncharismatic performance from Ralph Fiennes.\nThis movie was so bad that Warner Bros. wouldn't even let the critics see it prior to it's theatrical release but word of mouth soon spread about how bad it was and it sunk like a stone anyway. According to Total Film Magazine the movie was originally two and a half hours long and was hacked down to a mere 89 minutes for its theatrical release after a disastrous test screening, thus making Don MacPherson's screenplay (supposedly based on Shakespeares The Tempest) make even less sense. Voted the second worst blockbuster ever made by readers of the UK's Total Film magazine, this movie didn't help anybody's career but particularly harmed Uma Thurman whose previous outing had been the sequally awful Batman and Robin.\nThe saddest thing is it could have been good and I really did want to like this.","summary":"Sean Connery\/Ralph Fiennes  Hang Your Heads In Shame","unixReviewTime":1005696000,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

Gondek","reviewText":"The rumor that shuttled around a while is that the original script stayed very close to the TV show. The people who developed the film were huge Avengers fans that spent years trying to bring this to the screen and saw it as an art house action movie. When Warner's realized that they didn't have a big budget summer film for 1998,they rushed production on The Avengers, threw a lot of money at it, and more or less told the producers they wanted a big hit. Needless to say, pandering to the masses and doing good \"Avengers\" are incompatible, which the test audiences more or less told the studio execs during test screenings by not liking it at all and getting confused (though I am hard pressed to see how they were any more confused than I ended up) . Unfortunately, take out the sublime strangeness and the film falls apart and makes little sense. Apparently, the studio thought they could rush this out on name power and no real story and maybe make a little money, which is exactly how much they made.\nRegarding the film itself, it is gorgeous to look at but painful to watch. The three leads are badly miscast (You can't replace MacNee and Rigg, though Patrick Stewart and Lucy Lawless would have been MUCH more interesting than Fiennes and Thurman) and Sean Connery chews scenery like he hadn't eaten in months. would love the DVD to have loads of extras I am sure are milling about somewhere, including commentary by the director on what happened.\nStick with the TV Show.","summary":"The story of what happened to this film","unixReviewTime":997920000,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

They seemed to be doing a pretty good job but were asked to work with a pretty weak script. I found the special effects and cinematography to be pretty good also. The character interaction was very weak with very little attention given to the reason that Sean Connerys character for instance had such an infacuation with Mrs Peele-that is just one of many weaknesses i found in this film. As stated by film critics one of the main selling points was a chance for Uma Thurman to have her own fashion show(which in itself is not a bad thing).Others critcize it for being so campish and the constant silly banter going on between Mrs. Peel and John Steed. However, give it some credit for trying to stick to the formula that won the original tv series its loyal following. Anyone that follows those episodes will probably agree that this movie more or less stayed along those lines.

I don't know.\nI do understand that this movie  was supposed to represent the quirkiness of the original TV show, but I  didn't buy it.

The opening 45 minutes is  smashing-which is perhaps why the ending is so frustrating.\nThe main  reason for this let-down is not the ridiculousness of the plot. MISSION  IMPOSSIBLE, most Bond films, and even JURASSIC PARK have all had commercial  success with plots that weren't much better than this.  Rather, the failure  of this film comes in my mind from Sean Connery.  If this were the only  example of his acting one had ever seen, one would have difficulty seeing  how the man ever won an Oscar (R).  His performance is truly abysmal.  Yes,  the situations he's placed in and the lines themselves have a certain  hollowness to them, but all meglomaniacs in all action films are, well,  silly.  Though I do think one or two scenes exploring a bit more of de  Wynter's character might've been in order, films have been more satisfying  with less-scripted villains.  The glaring difficulty is that Connery  obviously doesn't *believe* in his character.  It's absolutely obvious that  he's not having fun-even with the good lines.  As a result, we don't  either.\nBy contrast, Fiennes and Thurman are having the time of their  lives, playing roles that seem to have been tailor-made for them, despite  having originated with other actors.  There are really no scenes which  their presence doesn't immediately help, and one can't help but feel that  if the movie had simply had a different actor cast as the villain, their  chemistry would've gone better appreciated by the viewing public.\n(DVD  notes: There are really no additional features on the DVD, which is  surprising.  The production team were all huge fans of the TV show and  spent years trying to bring this puppy to screen.  One would've thought  they'd have been absolutely passionate about trying to explain what had  been a big part of their lives for years.)","summary":"Connery's de Wynter freezes finale","unixReviewTime":961286400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Connery as the villain was OK but his objections should've  been more realistic.  The Alice character seemed to me the highlight of  this film for something that worked.  The movie did seem to be a combined  mixture of a couple Avenger episodes. But to adapt it as the 1960's was  wrong. They should've put it into the 1990's.

I have done an extensive side-by-side comparison and the transfer is unquestionably inferior with the new set. Colors are washed out, detail and definition are reduced. It's a very stark contrast. The video bitrates are markedly higher for the old discs vs. the new. I'm noticing bitrates that are as much as 30% higher in the head-to-head comparison.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, there is for some reason a significant variation in quality from episode to episode in the new set. The last one or two episodes on each disc are consistently and inexplicably much lower in quality than the other episodes on the disc. This is not the case with the older set. Take Season 1, Disc 3 for example: it contains eight episodes, and the first six average around 1.03 GB in raw size. But the last two episodes (\"Bum Voyage\" and \"Who's Been Sleeping on My Couch?\") come in around 780-800 MB. If that 30% difference doesn't sound bad to you, trust me when I say it is very noticeable, particularly with a 40-year old series shot on film. The older discs have no such variations in quality; the same episodes in that set consistently come in around 1.09 Gb each. Size isn't always a true indicator of video quality but in this case it holds true. Many episodes in the new set  just look plain bad, like they have been through an additional transfer generation or two.\n\nHowever, the \"Complete Series\" set is the only way to get your hands on the final two seasons, so if you own the older discs, my recommendation would be to make your own set with seasons 1-4 from the season discs and 5-6 from the new set. I can't comment on the bonus features as I haven't viewed them yet. But the episode commentaries are all still here and there doesn't seem to be anything new in that department.\n\nAnother difference that may matter to you: the new set does not include subtitles, whereas the old discs have both English and Spanish subtitles. It seems Shout! Factory left them out as part of their misguided effort to cram as many episodes on each disc as possible. I'm no fan of the double-sided disc format Fox used for the season releases, and it's a pain to switch the discs more often with fewer episodes per disc, but I'll take them over the new set any day.","summary":"A step down in video quality","unixReviewTime":1401321600,"vote":23.0,"image":null}

We've been waiting 8 years for this.  This is a different distributor, so we should understand they were probably not going to \"pick right up where Fox left off\".  It's not like this is going to be a huge seller.  As much as we love the series, we are WAY in the minority here.  At best, the individual seasons would sell for $15 to $20.  So instead of paying $40 for the final two, for another $40 you get the whole series, in a matched set.  Life is too short, I'm not going to let something this insignificant keep me from viewing clean, unedited versions of my favorite series of all time.\n\nMy current set I recorded off of Nick probably 15 years ago, transferred to MPEG files about 12-13 years ago, cut and edited them with some cheesy video editor from the early 2000's, and got them down to around 750 MB so that each would fit on a CD.  My backups have also clogged up my hard drives over the years.  $79 to get rid of all this headache and have the complete series? Bargain!!!!\n\nThanks for the wonderful series Mr. Newhart, just a timeless classic that we love so much.  The Doctor is IN!!!\n\nADDED 5\/27:  Got the set in today, worth the money.  I haven't compared the quality to the 4 Season set from Fox, but I did compare a couple of episodes to my mpeg versions I recorded 15 or so years ago.  The episodes are un-cut, which is great, but one other thing I noticed right off the bat is the episodes are the correct speed.  Syndication cuts episodes, but they also tend to speed them up to get more of the episode into the allotted 30 minute air time.  I was really surprised how much quicker the pace was on the old recordings, with all of the actor's voices a little higher as a result.  The new set is much more naturally-paced, more relaxed.  The video of the new set is not perfect, but it is very, very good.  I give it about 8.5 on a 1-10 scale.  It doesn't have that super clean, prisitine look of a big name series that has been fully restored from top-notch source elements.  But it is certainly cleaner than any Newhart episodes I have seen before, including the Fox videos.  The video is excellent for the most part and is consistent from episode to episode.  The audio is great, much cleaner than my recorded set which had a lot of hissing.  It is perfect for a 70's sitcom, I give the audio a 9.5 out of 10.\n\nIn any case, the purchase was well worth the $79.  Season 5 is one of my favorites, so I'm going to really enjoy the new set, and not worry about the $40 extra.  All in all..... \"Fine and Dandy\"!!","summary":"The wait is over!!!","unixReviewTime":1400630400,"vote":20.0,"image":null}

Keil","reviewText":"Looks like I'm the first reviewer to have actually received and viewed (at least in part) this set, having pre-ordered it from Shout who delivered it five weeks before the official release date.\n\nBACKGROUND: The Bob Newhart Show is my favorite show in the history of television. I've bought every VHS and DVD release available over the years, and have been making recordings off the air for 20 years in an effort to collect (and then \"upgrade\" the quality of) all the episodes in this series. My expectations for this set are high since the show deserves the best DVD release possible. Fox released the first four seasons in 2005 and 2006, only to leave fans hanging for 8 years for the last two seasons. Luckily, Shout Factory took the opportunity to release the Bob Newhart Show the way it should have been from the beginning - as a complete series set. Yes, this means hardcore fans like me have DVDs, VHS tapes, and old DVD-R recordings that we don't need anymore. So sell the old ones or give them away. To me it's a small price to pay to get this set.\n\nTHE SHOW ITSELF: Not much to say other than what you likely already know - The Bob Newhart Show is generally regarded as one of the greatest sitcoms of all time. Its rare combination of amazing writing, a top-notch cast, and a style of humor that is at once accessible and sophisticated, is a high water mark in the history of television.\n\nPACKAGING: The set comes in a standard height box with 3 Amaray-style cases that holds 6 discs apiece. Gone are the two-sided Fox discs with cheesy cartoon-themed menus. Here, discs for Seasons 1 and 2 are in one case, seasons 3 and 4 in a second case and seasons 5 and 6 are in the third case. These are NOT stacked on a spindle and thus are easily accessible. The disc faces feature nice 1970s-inspired artwork across all discs with color variations for each case. The fourth (bonus disc) case is a standard height but slim. The menus for each disc are based on the look of Bob's office door. Everything is classy and everything matches.\n\nAUDIO AND VIDEO QUALITY: The Bob Newhart Show has always had quality issues on broadcast and video release as far back as I remember, and sadly this release is no exception. Over the years I've assumed that the transfers we've seen are taken from either second-generation prints, 16mm dupes, or analog-sharpened film-to-tape transfers. Other sitcoms shot on film in this era look better. If anybody has inside information on the condition of the original or edited film elements I'd love to know the story. So generally the contrast on most episodes it too high and harsh looking, there is a lot of grain, and most episodes are pretty de-saturated and the color temperature is too magenta in my opinion. Sound is also a bit harsh and thin in most episodes. My guess is that Shout has used the best original material available, and I have certainly never seen this series look or sound better than it does in this DVD set. So it's just decent, and probably limited to being so just by the nature of the source material.\n\nEXTRAS: Every episode I've watched so far is uncut and runs about 25 minutes. Shout appears to have carried over the commentary tracks from the Fox discs. The 40-page booklet is very nicely designed, well written by sitcom expert Vince Waldron, and organized so you can find the episode titles, plot summaries, and airdates easily. The 19th Anniversary reunion show from 1991 is a 1-hour \"clip show\" that is just okay. It's nice to see the actors again, but not much actually happens other than setting up the clips which are (by themselves) great. The \"Group Therapy\" extra is a sit-down studio conversation with cast and crew that is very entertaining and insightful and lasts most of an hour. The unaired pilot is a real treat, and is quite different from the show as we would know it later.\n\nCONCLUSION: It great to finally see this show get the treatment it deserves with this Complete Series DVD release. The packaging, tasteful and consistent menus and disc artwork, full-length episodes, and extras are a fitting presentation. Other than some picture and sound quality issues that are probably inherent in the source material, there's little room for improvement in this set. Unless somebody finds some \"lost\" negatives or higher-quality masters in a vault or basement somewhere and makes a high-def blu-ray transfer of them, this is probably the best presentation of the Bob Newhart Show we will ever get. Overall well worth the money and a set to be re-watched for many years to come. The concept and execution of \"the sitcom\" just doesn't get any better than the Bob Newhart Show, specifically as it is delivered in this DVD set.

It was cheeky, weird and campy. All these elements make the transition to the big screen version. What's missing is the soul of the  television series.\nI'm not sure, though, that the original would play  well today without some updating. Like many things from the 60's, it was  something very much of its time. Look at the Connery Bond films...they  wouldn't be as accepted today as they were then.\nThe time frame within  gives us a context. Without the context, the material doesn't always work.  The original series for all of the well written episodes had episodes that  were poorly plotted messes. Like the Star Trek series of films, the past  seems to add an luster to these dramas that they don't always  deserve.\nStill, the original series was always a cut above the average  American television programs. It was always witty and the cast, more often  than not, could pull off the show precisely because of their charm. This  along with the bizarre elements that would crop up in the scripts made The  Avengers always good fun. The film doesn't completely pull it off, but  there are moments that work as well as the original series.\nFiennes  brings his own intrepetation to Steed. To have expected him to play it like  MacNee is pretty unrealistic and it probably wouldn't have worked. The same  goes for Thurman. However, for me she's the weak link in the  cast.\nConnery plays his part over the top. It works precisely because it  worked in the original series. Expectations can be daunting and this film  had too many expectations.

Imagine what these first four season sets will look like on single sided discs, restored, and professionally produced by ShoutFactory!\n\nThank you ShoutFactory! for answering the call of the consumer. I'll proudly spend my money with you!\n\n**UPDATE 4\/25\/2014:\nI received an advanced copy from Shout! Factory and I can tell you that each disc is single-sided and there is a significant improvement with the audio from the FOX seasons, as well as, a marked improvement with the video. Shout! Factory took extra care for this release.\n\nFor instance, several episodes from the FOX releases clipped the main title from the opening credits. Comparing the same episodes with the Shout! Factory release, the main titles are intact and all of the words are included. There are no episodes with muddled audio, either.\n\nThe Bonus Disc was out of this world. You get 50 minutes of the surviving cast talking about the show. It was recorded in December 2013, so Shout! Factory pulled out all of the stops to do this release justice. In addition, there are two more extras, including the unaired pilot episode with different characters.\n\nIn addition, there is an amazing book included that has an easy to read explanation as to how they show came about, stayed on the network, and left while it was still on top in the ratings.\n\nSeasons 1 & 2 are in one DVD case. Seasons 3 & 4 are in a separate DVD case. Seasons 5 & 6 are in a separate DVD case. The bonus disc is also separate. All are contained, along with the book, in the big box.\n\nNow, here is the not-so-good news regarding Season 5 Disc 1 - \"A Crime Most Foul\". It has a very noticeable sync problem. I contacted Shout! Factory to see if I was sent a defective disc and they replied that the master they had access to and used also had the sync problem. I'm not sure if Shout! Factory had access to the original broadcast master because the show was shot on film and I also don't believe CBS would have allowed it to air that way. Regardless, the master that Shout! Factory has access to is the problem, not your individual disc.\n\nOther than that, sit back and enjoy The Bob Newhart Show the way it was intended to be enjoyed. Thank you Shout! Factory for honoring Bob Newhart with this release and for answering the many fans who have been waiting a long time for this day to come as well!","summary":"*UPDATE-This is wonderful news...Thanks ShoutFactory!","unixReviewTime":1389225600,"vote":82.0,"image":null}

I've enjoyed the depth of their acting in other projects. They are both wonderfully talented. I anticipated this version with eagerness.\n\nAlas reader,  the screenplay. What were they thinking? The spirit of the piece was way, way off in key scenes.  Jane is rolling her eyes at times and they both speak so abusively to each other for a lot of it. The first meeting was like that, very nasty to each other there.\n\nBut what really was off was Hines  yelling  all the time.  I heard his radio take on Rochester and his characterization was much calmer with more control. This Rochester is more bombastic than likeable. Seriously, I cant see what attracts Jane to him! These yelling torrents ruin key moments like that first meeting for example.  However, the stay with me scene (after the aborted wedding) was the worst. He was actually horribly bullying and abusive here. He throws things, he hurts her. He blames Jane for not excepting his view. He excuses himself with a \"What was I supposed to do, tell you the truth?\" kind of attitude. As she leaves he's calling out \"That's right leave, its just like you.\" WHAT is he talking about?? Rochester is supposed to be heartbroken  NOT hateful. It was hard to watch such a total bolt away from the novel here!  And what's with all the open mouthed \"kissing\" when he proposes? (By the way, he yells here too!)\n\nBut there were scenes I really liked.  His confession of his past life to Jane is well staged and poignant. Watching the sunrise together was nice. When she just returns to Thornfield from visiting the aunt (that we never get to see-one moment she leaves the next she returns). The scenery and sets are all very pleasing. I especially loved the camera work during the party scene where Jane is remembering Blanche and Rochester singing. Bertha was a hoot. Shopping at Milcott was good, except for the insertion of Blanche there, Rochester is actually nice to Adel at times. Also, the ending, though the dialog is not exactly from the book, was extremely touching. They are both excellent in this scene. And a postscript scene with children and voice over was a nice touch.

Crabtree","reviewText":"Prior to 1967, \"The Avengers\" was yielded in black-and-white. Going to color was a definite improvement; however in 1968 there were three additional significant changes:\n\n1. Mrs. Peel (Diana Rigg) was traded out for Steed's new partner, Tara King (Linda Thorson).\n\n2. The producers asserted that the 1968 episodes were more [paraphrasing] \"believable\" -- in fact, just the opposite is true. The '68 episodes are more bizarre than ever, but still very good.\n\n3. There is more involvement by Steed's boss, \"Mother\" (a wheelchair-bound chubby guy who shows up in very strange places to discuss Steed's progress on respective cases).\n\nThis DVD package, (2 DVDs, individually cased and further packaged in an attractive cardboard box, this \"Set No. 2\" color-coded ORANGE), is the second of FIVE sets for the 1968 episodes. The marketing of \"The Avengers\" can be quite confusing so I wanted to get that information out up front. This is also the BEST way to buy the DVDs (by the \"set\" rather than by the \"volume\") for any season, from 1963 through 1968.\n\nPatrick Macnee shrewdly plays John Steed, England's gentleman undercover agent. Linda Thorson is one of several of a line of Steed's voluptuous sidekicks. In the U.S., most of us didn't even know about Honor Blackman and Macnee's other (earlier) partners until years later when these episodes finally emerged on VHS tape. Diana Rigg can probably claim about 60% of the credit for the vast number of U.S. audience members who were glued to their TVs when \"The Avengers\" finally hit here. The other 40% (not forgetting Macnee's fine performances) had to do with the presentation of this excellent series.\n\nStarting in 1965, with Rigg, the filmscore was notably updated and played more prominently throughout the story, enhancing the action and suspense. Also, the action itself was boosted. There was never a dull moment with Steed and Mrs. Peel. And these episodes were all FUN -- one embraced a sense that Macnee and Rigg were having a great time in making these films. Now that I've seen episodes from \"The Avengers'\" earlier years, ('63 and '64), I can see that they dragged quite a bit during that earlier era and were much more soap opera-ish. The fun continued throughout the final year, 1968, even though Linda Thorson was simply never quite as dynamic or as sexy as Diana Rigg. The '68 filmscore and title scenes at the beginning and the conclusion of each episode were spiffed up a bit too.\n\nEach of these 52-minute episodes is futuristic (at least for the period) and on the cutting edge of excellent television productions. I know of no series, \"The Original Star Trek Series\" excepted, which has remained as timeless as \"The Avengers\". You'll encounter, in the 1968 episodes, every nemesis ranging from Eastern spies posing as murderous British Army officers to equally murderous hotel desk clerks.\n\nIn the 1968 Set No. 2 (which includes Vols. 3 and 4), we're talking about six very enjoyable, action-packed, color episodes:\n\nVolume 3:\n\n\"All Done With Mirrors\" - Steed is under house arrest (a theme we've seen before!) while Tara plugs the leaks at a classified facility that hasn't been keeping its secrets.\n\n\"Legacy of Death\" - The inheritance of a dagger turns into a truly double-edged gift and bodies pile up in Steed's drawing room.\n\n\"Noon Doomsday\" - Steed is trapped in a convalescent home by an old adversary who has a flair for drama and a thirst for vengeance.\n\nVolume 4:\n\n\"Look (Stop Me If You've Heard this One)... But There Were These Two Fellers\" - John Cleese guest stars as Steed and Tara face down a band of killer clowns determined to save their rest home from destruction.\n\n\"Have Guns... Will Haggle\" - Tara's on the hot seat when Black Market rifle brokers choose her for a product demonstration!\n\n\"They Keep Killing Steed\" - A plot to infiltrate and subvert a peace conference hinges on the creation of an exact double of Steed (yet another familiar theme!)\n\nThe storylines of the various \"The Avengers\" episodes seem absurd to varying degrees as we view them today - but 1968 continued to escalate the absurdity beyond the previous years' entries. This did not diminish my enthusiasm for the \"The Avengers\" because the overall series always manifested a \"Batman\" (TV series) tongue-and-cheekness about it. I mention this only to prepare viewers for this actuality.\n\nThe casting in all episodes is spot-on, punctuated with the very best sets and scenic locations. And Linda Thorson's astounding beauty (tenoned with her great figure!) really accentuates the `60s look in her mod attire.\n\nI'll be reviewing all of the 1968 sets, (as I mentioned earlier, there are five in all, with 2 \"volumes\" per set), so be on the watch for my comments regarding the other sets at their appropriate sites on Amazon. In the meantime, while not exactly as marvelous as the 1967 episodes, this particular set still garners my highest recommendation!","summary":"Linda Thorson continues to bowl us over... details","unixReviewTime":1222128000,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

You'll encounter, in these episodes, every nemesis ranging from an airborne costume party to a man (actually, an androidish double of a man), who cannot be killed by traditional means.\n\nHere, we're talking about six very enjoyable, action-packed, color episodes:\n\n\"The Living Dead\" -- A group of men are lost in a disastrous mine collapse, including the local squire. Afterward, a local hermit spots \"the ghost\" of this man, the \"dead\" Duke of Benedict, (as opposed to his wimpy succeeder), near a spooky cemetery chapel. Steed and Mrs. Peel investigate and they discover an \"underground city\" where an army of pseudo-evil-German-types is being built up to take over Great Britain! A superior episode.\n\n\"The Hidden Tiger\" - A butler is ripped to shreds in an English manor house. Nearby is an agricultural research station which falls under the suspicion of Steed and Mrs. Peel. After more maulings (deaths), it becomes clear that a devious Sussex organization, P.U.R.R.R., (!!!) is linked to the killings - all the victims seem to be on the organization's board of directors.\n\n\"The Correct Way to Kill\" - Russian espionage agents are being killed off in England... but not by the English agents. Steed and Mrs. Peel pair off with their Russian counterparts to catch the murderer. This episode is a lot of fun.\n\n\"Never, Never Say Die\" - A man is accidentally run down by a car and killed... but then he \"escapes\" off the exam table when the doc isn't watching! Steed and Mrs. Peel really get suspicious when he is killed a second time, by the same means, and later shows up causing a LOT of trouble. This macho guy also seems much affected by radio waves which leads The Avengers to discover that the man is an android and that more such android \"doubles\" of important people are infesting the local community. The bonus of this episode is that it stars the great Christopher Lee!\n\n\"Epic\" -- Mrs. Peel is kidnapped and taken to Schneer Studios where she is forced to make a movie about her own murder; however, the killers are mostly incompetent. This is a funny one.\n\n\"The Superlative Seven\" - Steed attends a high-end costume party that is conducted in an aircraft bound for... ??????  It's quickly discovered that all the invited guests are athletes of sorts and that they will be utilized to test a new and improved superman. Mrs. Peel flies to the dangerous and isolated island stronghold to attempt Steed's rescue. A very fun romp of an episode.\n\nThe storylines of the various \"The Avengers\" episodes seem absurd to varying degrees as we view them today - but 1967 marked an even higher level of absurdity... in fact, it actually went \"sci-fi\" in some episodes. This did not diminish my love for the \"The Avengers\" because the overall series always manifested a \"Batman\" (TV series) tongue-and-cheekness about it. I mention it only to prepare viewers for these changes and actualities.\n\nThe casting in all episodes is spot-on, punctuated with the very best sets and scenic locations. And Rigg's provocative, '60s mod body suits much accentuate her sensual magnetism with the notable change from black-and-white to color.\n\nI'll be reviewing all of the 1967 \"sets,\" (as I mentioned earlier, there are four in all, with 2 \"volumes\" per set), over the next few days so be on the watch for my comments regarding the other sets at their appropriate sites on Amazon.

Crabtree","reviewText":"James Bond, move over! This is a set of SEVEN, 52-minute entries from the great and brilliant team of Patrick Macnee (as the aristocratic John Steed) and Diana Rigg (as the tantalizing Emma Peel). The Rigg years were definitely the best ones and there is one other set from 1966 (also with Rigg, it offers SIX episodes) so don't confuse them! All these episodes were shot in black-and-white and the aspect is full-screen. Here's a rundown of the episodes:\n\n\"The Danger Makers\" --  The '60s version of the TV show \"Jackass\"! Steed and Peel have to ascertain why these important British officials continue to challenge suicide -- and some succeed! Written by Roger Marshall.\n\n\"A Touch of Brimstone\" -- This one was banned from American television because Emma Peel dons high-laced boots, a spiked dog collar and a very skimpy outfit! Here, we have The Hellfire Club, hoaxsters, and murder! Written by Brian Clemens.\n\n\"A Sense of History\" -- It's a battle over economic theory, by medieval Robin Hood types. But these denizens of the woods (and a college campus) don't mind killing those who disagree with their views. This is a superb episode. Written by Martin Woodhouse.\n\n\"How to Succeed... at Murder\" -- Business executives are being knocked off... by their feminist secretaries?!? The trail leads Steed and Mrs. Peel to an elite perfumery but the ring leader is quite elusive. Written by Brian Clemens.\n\n\"Honey for the Prince\" -- A Middle-eastern prince on a diplomatic mission is the target for assassination. Steed and Mrs. Peel intervene. Diana Rigg was never HOTTER than she was in this special \"Bonus Episode\". Written by Brian Clemens.\n\n\"What the Butler Saw\" -- The secret defense plans are stolen! Steed must take on the disguise of a student butler to resolve the mystery. Written by Brian Clemens.\n\n\"The House That Jack Built\" -- Here, we have a psychological thriller. Mrs. Peel inherits an estate from her \"Uncle Jack,\" and is subsequently  trapped inside a carnivalistic madhouse. Steed rushes to the rescue. This is a great one. Written by Brian Clemens.\n\nI don't know if you get the same deal if you purchase the DVD set -- with the VHS set, you'll get 3 tapes, with two episodes per tape (except on one tape where there's the \"bonus episode,\" which makes three episodes on that one), for a total of 7 episodes. The tapes are not copy-protected.\n\nThere were Avengers episodes prior to 1965 but they weren't quite as good -- they were more soap opera-ish. Macnee had two or three different lady-partners during those earlier years and those gals simply weren't as dynamic as Rigg. Also, the music, action, and story-writing much improved in '65, which is when \"The Avengers\" got launched on to American television -- I watched every one of these episodes at the time. These black-and-white Macnee-Rigg entries continued through 1966, (it went color after that and Rigg eventually left the series). In the end, '65 and '66 were the two best years of all.","summary":"Superb British cult B&W television!","unixReviewTime":1206489600,"vote":null,"image":null}

When she gets to the manor, she soon finds herself drugged and trapped inside a house that is far from your normal house, as designed to end Emma's life.\n\n5) \"A Sense of History\" Have Emma donning a merry man's costume in this Robin Hood adventure.  A modern day Robin is found with an arrow in the back, pushing Steed and Emma to stop the neo-fascist Merry Men from achieving their devilish plans.\n\n6) \"How to Succeed at Murder\" puts Emma and John on the trail of executives being executed, in a posh perfumerie where a woman \"nose\" best.\n\n7) \"Honey for the Prince\" when a resort where you live out your fantasies turns deadly, our pair are sent to stop the evil doings.  Emma goes harem girl! to save the day and up the ratings!\n\nMany were written by Brian Clements with a variety of directors such as James Hill, Don Leaver, Peter Graham Scott and Charles Crichton.","summary":"second set of '66 series","unixReviewTime":1097452800,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

Rigg and Macnee have the perfect sizzle of chemistry.  Admiration in their eyes, the flash and fire, but all kept quite under control as they function together to stop the evil menace against Britain.  I have seen some say this series came about because of the success of the Bond Film, but it was already on the air with the\nearly episodes, and follow in the trek of Patrick MacGoohan's \"Danger Man\", which turned into \"Secret Agent\" (and then into \"the Prisoner\").  These seven episodes are still in B&W, which I think even added to this mysterious ambiance of the episodes.  Being able to film in lower light, permits those deep shadows, giving a sinister touch.\n\n1) \"The Murder Market\" takes Steed and Emma undercover at a marriage bureau, ending with Steed rescuing Emma from being buried alive as she gets too close to the \"black widows\" at the center of this evil plot\n2) \"A Surfeit of H20\" A freak rainstorm drowns locals in the fields.  Fearing this is the return of the \"Great Flood\", they villagers have begun building a new Ark.  Emma is stylish even in a Mac!\n3) \"The Hour That Never Was\" Steed visits his old RAF airbase in Hamlin.\nHours are missing in people's memories, so Steed and Emma must uncover brainwashing saboteurs, threatening England.\n4) \"Dial a Deadly Number\" have Steed and Emma investigating a device called a \"Bleeper\".  The Bleeper is designed to help millionaires keep in touch, but an evil doer has set it to reach out and kill.\n5) \"Man-Eater of Surrey Green\"  When a outer space artichoke, lands and takes root, and begins killing eminent horticulturists, Emma and Steed get out the Roundup.  Rocky and Bullwinkle fought a similar plant in the cartoons - wonder who was first...lol?\n6) \"Two's A Crowd\" Russian agents had let loose a doppelganger for Steed, in order to infiltrate a defense conference\n7) \"Too Many Christmas Trees\" is one of my fav episodes.  Steed has been having a strange nightmare, so he welcomes the invitation for Hols in the country at friends.  He invites Emma to tag along.  They dress up in period costumes, and all seem to have a good time, but Emma begins to suspect Steed's dream is not a dream, but someone trying to control Steed's mine through telepathy\n\nJust great fun to have these on DVD.","summary":"second sets of DVD with Emma Peel","unixReviewTime":1097452800,"vote":13.0,"image":null}

Such is the case especially with \"A Sense of History,\" in which she dresses in a leg-revealing Robin Hood outfit, and \"A Touch of Brimstone,\" where she wears next to nothing as the Queen of Sin (and is attacked with a whip, to boot).  \"How To Succeed...At Murder\" has her in a bodystocking\/leotard, practicing ballet for a good portion of the story.  And when she isn't dressing down, she's quite the clothes-horse, wearing a gorgeous white pants suit, for instance, in \"The House That Jack Built,\" a memorably striking bit of surrealistic sci-fi.\nOh, yes  -  Patrick Macnee is here too, lest we forget that he was the only actor to have starred in every season of the show.

The cinematography is curiously rather bleached, for what probably should have been a starker melodrama  -  but it works splendidly, anyway.  This one consists mostly of skulking and good fights, Emma's skulking done in a fetching peignoir by moonlight.  The flirtation between Emma and Steed is especially light and playful.  The plot, about a secret submarine base and its connection to the disruption of the local economy, is clever and credibly handled.\n\"The Master Minds\" is one of my personal favorites, about a MENSA-esque high-I.Q. club called RANSACK, which utilizes the best minds in Britain  -  without their knowledge  -  to infiltrate and sabotage military bases, and steal state secrets for sale to the highest bidder.  It's quite similar to Ian Fleming's contemporaneous James Bond novel, \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\"  -  which, amusingly enough, starred Diana Rigg in the film version.  Like \"Castle De'ath,\" Steed and Emma work undercover at the same location, but with a far different result:  Emma becomes brainwashed into RANSACK's nocturnal espionage society, and Steed has to snap her out of it  -  before she kills him.  The concluding fight is terrific, Emma's final punch-line one of the more humorous in the series by means of its unique delivery.\nA very good pair of early Avengers episodes.","summary":"Steed Boosts His I.Q.  -  Emma Boosts State Secrets","unixReviewTime":1020124800,"vote":null,"image":null}

I actually have 3 favorites: 1983, this one, and 2011. They are each different and have qualities that I love. Ciaran Hinds definitely brings out the edgier, tempermental side, which like it or not, is the way Mr. Rochester is described in the book. I like that portrayal, but I also appreciate the more restrained rendition done by Michael Fassbender, as do I enjoy the cocky, domineering traits brought out by Timothy Dalton. They are all good, folks. No need to feel disloyal for liking more than one. However, stay away from the William Hurt version. He did not even come close to filling Mr. Rochesters shoes. It was a train wreck.\nWhat I really like about this version is the sweet chemistry between Jane and Mr. Rochester. She finds him charming in spite of how flawed he is, and it really shows in her expressions. Ciaran Hinds' Mr. Rochester is abrupt and unpolished, and I rather liked his portrayal. His Mr. Rochester is gruff, passionate, volatile, and vulnerable. And Samantha Morton's Jane is spunky, sweet, and feminine, I think more so than other Jane Eyre's. Yet she still embodied Jane's quiet reserve and stifled passion.\nI watched this movie when it came out back in 1997.

Besides this particular adaptation, I've seen 6 others: '11 movie, '06 mini, '96 movie, '83 mini,'73 mini, and '44 movie.\nWhile I believe the story line (500+ page novel) is better suited to a mini series length; I quite enjoyed the latest ('11) movie- despite its being only 2 hrs. long!\n\nAs for this particular one:\n\nDon't be fooled by its title, this production is far removed from the book (so if you've never read it, and are seeking an authentic adaptation-- look elsewhere)! The only things that the two have in common are the names of its characters, and a few sequence of events! 95% of the dialogue has been rewritten (and butchered), and some events made up!\n\nRochester is an insufferable, maniacal, beast of a man!  With a constant scowl on his face, and a snappish bark of a tone.\nHow Jane could have felt anything beyond oppression and disdain is beyond me! Jane's character is even altered; she's borderline bratty, somewhat mouthy, and unreservedly opinionated.\nBeyond any and all comprehension she actually loves Rochester (despite his blatant mistreatment of her- especially when she's about to leave)!!\n..Thankfully it was only 108 minutes long-- anything beyond that would have been torture!\n_________\n\nIf you're entirely new to this story, please get acquainted with the book before or after viewing! If you're not a fan of reading (or listening to an audio book), and you'd rather watch an adaptation- I recommend looking into the 1973 or 1983 BBC miniseries. While these earlier productions are a bit dated and theatrical\/stagey, they are the most faithful to the book.  As for the latest mini series, the only real advantage it has compared to the '73 & '83 renditions, is that it has the modern cinematic feel\/experience (meaning the acting & sets aren't as stiff and theatrical). In my opinion however, it's the weakest adaptation to date.  The dialogue is more modernized, certain events unfaithfully re-written, and the relationship between Rochester & Jane overly romanticized (when compared to the book).\nIf time is a factor, the movie I recommend is the '11 (although be advised it begins at chapter 28 in the book, and then goes back to Jane's beginning).  There are a couple of deleted scenes that add more background to the story, so you may want to check them out.","summary":"\"Jane Eyre\", or \"Beauty & The Beast\"?!","unixReviewTime":1407369600,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

Not quite. Institutionalized by her aunt (Deborah Findlay -Cranford), child Jane's life can get no worse. Moved on as a governess at Thornfield, its wealthy owner Mr Rochester (Ciaran Hinds). Jane trifles with love after a not so dignified introduction. There is a strangeness about the house and among those living there. This version dwells little on the child Jane, but focuses on her relationship with her master.\nSecrets are hidden behind a closed 3rd floor, a female, a dangerous person. Jane is even required to stop a murder. It is the inner struggle of mature emotion that makes Jane Eyre such a compulsive story, written by Charlotte Bronte as one of her finest novel works.\nNo faults can be said of this fine cast. Samantha Morton is superb and believable as Jane. Gemma Jones (Last Tango in Halifax) plays Mrs Fairfax here, and has been a favorite of ours since she starred in `The Duchess of Duke Street.'\nMy wife and I both liked this DVD version of Jane Eyre.

Not only were several key scenes deleted, they chose to put in words and scenes that were never in the book. So why did I give it a three-star rating? Well, this is because of the wonderful acting by the main characters.\n\nSamantha Morton, whose luminous beauty is portrayed subtly here, plays plain Jane Eyre, whose intellect and high moral character is wonderfully and credibly depicted here. Mr. Rochester is played by the consummate Ciaran Hinds who first impressed me in his performance as the lead character in&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Mayor-of-Casterbridge\/dp\/B0000AQS3P\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Mayor of Casterbridge<\/a>&nbsp;and who delivered a finely nuanced performance as the once thwarted in love Captain Frederick Wentworth in&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Persuasion\/dp\/B001DUDKEY\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Persuasion<\/a>. Both actors deliver credible, compelling performances and the age gap is certainly true to the novel, though many of the dialogue and scenes may not. The chemistry is believable, though not the best of all the adaptations.\n\nIf you watch closely, you'll recognize several other familiar faces in British period drama.

Schrecker","reviewText":"I love Charlotte Bronte's novel, Jane Eyre, and I've read it several times.  Also an avid movie fan, I have seen almost every production of Jane Eyre.  I have to admit, being a classic movie lover, I still place the Orson Wells\/Joan Fontaine version first among them all, and not because it was absolutely true to the novel, but because it was the most successful of all versions in creating the gothic mood of the Bronte novel in the grand Hollywood manner.  Of course, it also had Orson Wells, whose masterful portrayal of Rochester gave the character such depth and mystery as to forever seal the part in his name.\n\nHowever, this version starring Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton is my second favorite for several reasons.  First, the casting was perfect.  Ciaran Hinds does a wonderful job portraying Edward Rochester, a complex, authoritative and tortured man who is hiding a horrible secret.  He is supposed to be almost 20 years older than Jane and not overly handsome--although not as moody and dark as Orson wells, he gives the character more humor and fits the bill admirably.  Samantha Morton is simply fantastic as Jane Eyre.  She is my favorite of all the female leads to date.  She is not as pretty as Joan Fontaine or Mia Wasikowska, but she is attractive enough to be pleasant to watch.  (Jane is supposed to be \"plain.\")  Her Jane has much more personality compared to other actresses who have played the part.  She gives us a strong, confident Jane while showing us enough warmth to make her sympathetic to the viewer.  She is Jane Eyre in my eyes.  The two leads have one thing that many other versions do not--fantastic chemistry!!!  Together, they sizzle on the screen, which is something you would not expect from these two as a couple.\n\nThe production is fantastic, as is the photography and script adaptation.  I have only two beefs with this production--first, the actress playing Adele was too old and rather irritating.  Second, I absolutely hate the singing voice they dubbed in for Edward\/Ciaran--that high, operatic tenor just didn't seem like it could come out of his throat.  If they could have fixed those two things, this would have been the perfect version.\n\nAs for the other versions I have seen, I'll list them here in my order of preference with a quick review:\n\n3)  2011 Version with Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fessbender:  My third favorite; major problems include Mia being way too pretty to play Jane, and she needed a bit more personality.  Michael Fessbender was admirable as Rochester, but he physically did not fit the part--too handsome and too \"blonde\".  Rochester was always referred to being dark, mysterious with black hair and eyes--hard to get past that part, but he is a sexy man.\n4)  2007 Masterpiece Theatre version with Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens:  Non-descript actors, but a decent production.  Except for one hot scene with Jane and Edward on the bed (which would NEVER have happened in the novel), sort of forgettable.\n5)  1971 Version with George C. Scott and Susannah York:  Miscast; both leads were too old for the parts--so\/so version, nothing too much going on here.\n6)  2003 Version with Willian Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg:  I like Willian Hurt, but I hated him in this part.  Too blonde, too cold, no mystery here.  Charlotte Gainsbourg was painfully plain with NO personality.  This was as dry as toast and uninteresting with little to hold your attention.  NO chemistry between the two leads--absolutely none.\n7)  BBC Version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke:  There is a good thing and a bad thing about this version and they both are Timothy Dalton!  He is WAY TOO HANDSOME to play Edward.  There is a part in this version where Edward asks Jane, \"Do you find me handsome?\" and she answers \"No.\"  What a laugh!  Timothy Dalton is pure eye candy.  No one could get past this without laughing.  He was horribly miscast as the brooding and mysterious Edward.  On the plus side, he is the only good thing about this production!  His acting holds the whole thing together--the actress they have playing Jane has as much personality as a pet rock.  Not attractive, which isn't a major problem because Jane is supposed to be rather plain, she should have at least SOME qualities to make her feasibly attractive to the fantastically handsome Timothy Dalton.  In real life, Ol' Tim wouldn't have looked twice in her direction.  Also, her acting was wooden, and she had this horrible pimple or wart on her face that kept moving about in different scenes--it drove me crazy.  So, after seeing the rather lack-luster Jane, Timothy Dalton is the entire production.  It is a dated and small production; hard to watch after viewing the other movie versions--but I do realize that this was an early made for TV\/BBC production so you can't expect much.  I know many will call me out for trashing their beloved BBC production, but I have to call it as I see it.","summary":"One of the BEST!","unixReviewTime":1350518400,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

I have to say that I think the actors playing Rochester and Jane did a great job.  Rochester has been described as a screamer, and while I can see why people say that, Rochester IS a very emotional character.  I didn't find that a problem.  I did find the language and liberties taken with some scenes unfortunate - I am not against modifying dialogue to help the flow of the movie, but too many liberties were taken here!  That being said, I really, really enjoyed this movie.  I enjoyed seeing a short Jane Eyre, and all the stuff that was cut out were the things that you tend to want to hurry through when you're reading it anyway.  In fact, I have been guilty of skipping through Jane's childhood in one or two of the versions that I own.  :D  This movie also totally skips the whole issue of Jane gaining an independence, which in the grand scheme of things, doesn't really matter too much to the meat of the story.","summary":"Very enjoyable, but far from being true to the book","unixReviewTime":1348531200,"vote":null,"image":null}

This wonderful series has become a British institution and a worldwide favorite among viewers.  It has a huge fan following.\nThe story follows the lives and loves of the Bellamy family who reside in a fashionable house in Eaton Place.  Downstairs, their loyal and lively servants uphold their own code of values whilst trying to come to terms with an ever-changing world.  UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS covers the years 1903-1930, and features fantastic writing and direction, not to mention top-drawer performances from a gloriously talented cast.\nSeason 1 - We are introduced to the Bellamy family:  Richard (David Langton), his wife Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) and their grown-up children James (Simon Williams) and Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett).  In the first episode, \"On Trial\", we also meet the vivacious Clemence (Pauline Collins) who arrives at 165 Eaton Place looking for a job.  After Lady Marjorie re-names the girl Sarah, she's quickly inducted into the household, but finds life as a servant frustrating and unnatural.\nLater choice moments in the season include \"Magic Casements\", where Lady Marjorie has a brief and tender affair with a young army captain; \"The Path of Duty\" features the rebellious Elizabeth running away from home on the eve of her society debut; \"Why is Her Door Locked?\" recounts the unhappy, emotionally-disturbed Mrs Bridges (Angela Baddeley) kidnapping a small child.  The season ends on a hopeful note as Elizabeth marries the romantic poet Lawrence Kirbridge (Ian Ogilvy) in \"For Love of Love\".\nSeason 2 - Picks up the story following Elizabeth and Lawrence's honeymoon, and their household in Greenwich.  Humorous scenes downstairs featuring Rose (Jean Marsh), Thomas (John Alderton) and Mrs Fellowes (Dorothy Frere) contrast dramatically with the unhappy marriage of Elizabeth and Lawrence upstairs.\nOther standout episodes include \"Your Obediant Servant\", where Hudson (Gordon Jackson) dresses up as a toff in order to impress his brother's family who are visiting from India; \"The Property of a Lady\" where Sarah and Thomas attempt to help Lady Marjorie who's being blackmailed about her secret affair from Season 1; and \"Out of the Everywhere\" where the resourceful Sarah once again saves the day for the Bellamy's.  Perhaps the season is best-remembered for \"Guest of Honour\" in which King Edward comes to dine at 165.  This season marked the last for Elizabeth, Thomas and Sarah.\nSeason 3 - Another strong season, which gets off to a cracking start in \"Miss Forrest\", in which Richard has hired the services of secretary Hazel Forrest (Meg Wynn Owen) while he is busy writing Lord Southwold's political biography.  Lady Marjorie is getting ready for a voyage on the Titanic...\nLater standouts include \"A Perfect Stranger\" where Rose gets her first taste of real love when she meets charming Gregory Wilmot (Keith Barron), an Australian sheep-farmer. Romance also keeps up James who impetuously proposes to and marries the mild-mannered Hazel;  \"Goodwill to all Men\" introduces us to Lord Southwold's young ward Georgina Worsley (Lesley-Anne Down), and a charming storyline featuring the second (and last) appearance of Cathleen Nesbitt as Dowager Lady Southwold.  The season ends on a dramatic note when World War One is declared.\nSeason 4 - Generally regarded by fans as the strongest of the five seasons, with superb acting and cracker storylines.  The season starts off with \"A Patriotic Offering\" where Lady Prudence (Joan Benham) suggests that Hazel takes in a family of Belgian refugees.  \"The Beastly Hun\" features an Emmy-winning performance from Gordon Jackson; whilst \"If You Were the Only Girl in the World\" has Hazel falling in love with a handsome young airman who is later tragically killed in a bombing strike.  The season also introduces us to the charming naval widow Virginia Hamilton (Hannah Gordon), who turns to Richard for help when her oldest son is to be court-martialled.  The season ends on a tragic note when Hazel contracts a severe and dangerous strain of the flu virus just as peace is declared by England.\nSeason 5 - James and Georgina settle into a party lifestyle with their mindless society friends, whilst the newly-married Richard and Virginia settle into life at Eaton Place with her two young children Alice (Anne Yarker) and William (Jonathan Seely).  \"A Place in the World\" details bored and dissatisfied James following his father in politics; \"Disillusion\" follows an ill-fated romance between Hudson and young maid Lily (Karen Dotrice), and Georgina toys with a career as a movie actress in \"Alberto\".  The season ends with the marriage of Georgina and Robert, the Marquis of Stockbridge (Anthony Andrews).  James returns from a trip to America with big dreams about the Stock Exchange, but then the Wall Street crash puts the financial future of  the Bellamy's in doubt...\nThere aren't enough words to express how much I love UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS.  My favorite moments from the series come mostly from seasons 1 and 2, and while I love the entire series, I particularly love the performances of Nicola Pagett (Elizabeth) and Pauline Collins (Sarah).\nIf you are a fan of the series or a fan of British period drama, then I highly-recommend this superb series!  A must-own.","summary":"the entire series in a 20-disc box set!","unixReviewTime":1064534400,"vote":67.0,"image":null}

Greenbaum","reviewText":"It wasn't commercial.  It wasn't conventional.  It dealt with issues not often talked about in the early 70s, both the social issues that permiate through the series, and also such issues, in certain episodes, as prejudice, suicide, and homosexuality.\n  This is the story of the Bellamy household at 165 Eaton Place, London, both the upstairs family (the Bellamy family, led by Richard Bellamy, a member of Parliament) and the downstairs family (the servants, led by Angus Hudson, the butler, who in his way is more aristocratic than the aristocrats).  Yet in many ways, they are a single family, and we see them from the period 1905 to the 1920s, an era of profound social change, and we see the effects such changes have on this household, from a time when going \"into service\" was routine to the time when having half a dozen servants for a small upper middle class family such as the Bellamys was beginning to be the exception, not the rule.\n  The series includes rarely shown episodes from the 1st season, as well as the special, Upstairs Downstairs Remembered: The 25th Anniversary Special.  While the special is included with the first series episodes, I would advise waiting until you have viewed the entire series before watching the special, to avoid any plot points being given away.\n  The acting is wonderful, led by Gordon Jackson (as Hudson, the butler), David Langton (as Richard Bellamy), and Jean Marsh (as house parlormaid Rose Buck).  Marsh also originated and guided the series.  These three characters seem like rocks, upon which the waves of the social changes beat.  Yet they are worn and changed by the events of this incredible era.  Nonetheless, this is very much an ensemble cast--no character appears in more than 60 of the 68 episodes.\n  The first season seems almost experimental--many of the episodes have specific themes, such as those mentioned above.  A couple were unsuccessful and their events are never referred to again (for example, \"The Swedish Tiger\").  In the remaining seasons, events tend to build over the thirteen episodes, to culminate to some extent in the final episode of the season, which usually deals with a major event in the world (for example the King's death at the end of the second season, the start of the war in the third, the end of the war in the fourth).\n  Perhaps the most powerful episodes are those dealing with World War I, and the profound waste of the war, as many of the best of the generation are lost.  By the end of the War, there has been tremendous tragedy, and even the most ardent supporter of the war doubts the justice of the war.  But do not underestimate the fifth season, as the social structure crumbles.  The signs of this crumbling are seen throughout the earlier episodes, but they come to a head in the fifth season.\n  I have tried  to avoid discussing the plot, so as not to give away the plot events that should come as a surprise to you.  But suffice it to say that this is one of the first series when anything can happen within the framework of the series, when you could not count on everything ending happily by the end of the hour--or at all.\n  Brilliant.  Brilliant.","summary":"Fine, fine series well-remembered from the 70s.","unixReviewTime":1058140800,"vote":174.0,"image":null}

Spanning five seasons, the writing, acting, and directing were uniformly excellent.\nUpstairs are the Bellamy family. The two members that continue for all five seasons are Richard Bellamy, a member of Parliament, and his son James, a Captain in the English army. Downstairs are the servants who are led for all five seasons by Hudson, the butler, Mrs. Bridges, the cook, and Rose, a maid. The performances by all these principals were excellent in every respect.\nDozens of other characters come in and out of the various plots throughout the years. Most notable are Richard Bellamy's first wife Lady Marjorie and a niece, Georgina. Downstairs Edward, the footman and chauffeur, his wife Daisy, and Ruby, helper to Mrs. Bridges, all played important roles in the series.\nMany things make this series great and the stories come first. The Bellamy family and their servants are living in tumultuous times, the first thirty years or so of the 20th Century. The 1st World War, \"the war to end all wars,\" was a defining moment in time for the English, the Bellamy family, and their servants. The war changed everyone and everything forever and this series does justice to the horror of that terrible event and its impact on the lives of the English people.\nBut the war is only a part of the story line, albeit an important one. We come to know the Bellamys and their servants almost as well as our own family. In fact, they seem to become a part of our family, so real are the stories and the performances of the actors. Rarely have actors in a television series ever been able to provide so much depth of characterization. This is due largely to the fine direction and superb dialogue of the scripts for each episode of the series.\nFor the most part the action takes place in the Bellamy's London home. Over five seasons we see little of London except through the windows of the Bellamy's house. The war footage is a notable exception to this statement. Even so, enough is happening under that roof to keep us genuinely interested and engaged.\nI had not seen this series when it originally aired thirty years ago and only by accident saw a video of a first season episode. I was quickly \"hooked\" and then watched the rest of the five seasons on DVD. Other than taking less room on your shelf, the DVDs did not appear to me to be much better than the video I viewed.\nIt seemed to me as if the program, like a fine wine, aged gracefully and improved over time. I know that I enjoyed each season just a bit more than the last and with great regret watched the final episodes. It was as if I were saying goodbye forever to close friends and family.\nThis series is good enough for a repeat viewing and so I have the deferred pleasure of knowing I will be reintroduced to the Bellamys and all their servants at some later time. However, for the first-time viewer, a real treat is in store for you!","summary":"The finest extended series of films ever made for TV.","unixReviewTime":1044403200,"vote":17.0,"image":null}

Scott\/Susannah York version of Jane Eyre, the Toby Stephens\/Ruth Wilson version of Jane Eyre and the Ciaran Hinds\/Samantha Morton version of Jane Eyre--yes, it's one of my favorite movies. Without a doubt, Ciaran Hinds' portrayal of Rochester is head and shoulders above Timothy Dalton as well as Toby Stephens. I do like Toby Stephens but Ciaran Hinds' facial expressions, his emotional portrayal of Rochester is unparalleled.  Samantha Morton is a wonderful Jane, plain yet with an inner beauty, stoic and strong, unemotional on the surface but in love with Mr. Rochester.  She was the ideal actress for this role. I was very disappointed with the portrayal of Jane in the Timothy Dalton\/Zelah Clark version, for one thing Zelah Clark is so short compared to Dalton, I couldn't watch the movie without thinking she looked like a child in height yet older in her face than Dalton--it was very distracting for me.  She also does not have the range of acting and emotion Samantha Morton gives in her performance--Clark is very bland compared to Morton.  As much as I like Timothy Dalton, he isn't Rochester. The George C. Scott\/Susannah York version is good, I really liked George C. Scott as Rochester but not as much as Hinds. Susannah York comes closer to Samantha Morton as Jane than any of the other versions but Samantha Morton still excels in this part.\n.\nThere are many comments about the Hinda\/Morton version not closely following the book, I was more interested in the movie than the book, if I purely wanted the book, I would read that and not watch the movie. I've seen the Hinds\/Morton Jane Eyre many times, each time I see more and more pure acting ability from Hinds than any other actor in this role, his facial expressions portray as much as his spoken lines. Hinds in excellent in portraying the gruffness and hard edge of Rochester yet tenderness in his passion and love for Jane--Hinds brings Rochester to life. The last scenes of this movie with Hinds' and Morton's recital of love and devotion for each other are nothing short of astounding.  Hinds' tears were real as he poured out his heart to Jane that he was no longer worthy of her, how could she love him now as a wounded blind man unable to care for her--amazing acting on Hinds' part.  The same was true for Morton as Jane, her tears flowed easily and with such realism as she promised to never leave him again, she had returned to him forever.\n\nOf the other versions of Jane Eyre, Toby Stephens as Rochester would be my next choice, even over Scott, but as good as he is, Stephens honestly doesn't hold a candle to Hinds as Rochester. I particularly missed the passion and pure emotion in the last scenes with Stephens and Wilson, it was weak compared to Hinds and Morton. If I want authenticity, perhaps I'll go to the Stephens\/Wilson version, for pure enjoyment and richness of acting in a love story, it's Hinds and Morton hands down.  I would have given this movie 4 stars if based totally on the story, but I've given this version 5 stars based on the rich acting of both the lead actors (especially Hinds), they are wonderful.","summary":"Ciaran Hinds the perfect Rochester","unixReviewTime":1331164800,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

Jane is a substantial person with depth. Samantha captures the fairy unworldy part but never is strong and resounding in her performance. It is almost like the role was too much for what she had inside to give to it.\n\nCiaran Hinds on the other hand carries this version.  He is a GREAT Mr. Rochester! I love the novel and have various movie versions; I was totally surprised by him. He totally carries the flick! With the exception of the kissing scene where he reveals his feelings for her after she returns from being away - the side of the face fake kisses (don't look!).

I highly recommend this movie, I liked this version of Jane Eyre very much!

He got so wild when Jane \"bewitched\" his horse that I thought he was going to take his wife's place in the attic. So over-the-top was his rough exterior that his passionate scenes with Jane at first evoked from me hearty laughter, which I don't think was the intended effect. She'd never like a guy like that, and he'd...well. I just wasn't seeing it. At first.\n\nSo why the five star rating? Because this is a difficult movie to get right. It's not five stars for perfection, but five stars for being far and away the best adaptation of the four I've seen so far.\n\nIt spares you lengthy portrayals of the scenes where a little goes a long way (Lowood, also the Auntie's stewardship of Jane, etc.) and instead saves the film for scenes that really need to be developed carefully in order for the lengthy novel to be credible onscreen. That is, Rochester and Jane need time to grow in their relationship. Some adaptations try to rush it and you see Jane falling in love with a crazy, irate cooky guy who explores his deepest affect, out loud and rather distastefully, to what appears onscreen to be a complete stranger not ridiculously fond of him. This version was a very nice effort, but there was one part a bit rushed-her missing him after she simply tells us they had more talks together. A minor detail. Her portrayal was very good and real. Compare it to the 1996 version (Hurt\/Gainsbourg) where Rochester comments to Jane about the tears ready to come into her eyes. This is after Jane is forced to watch Rochester with the new chick on the block. Then he says, \"or do I see them there now?\" Problem is, she doesn't look at all like she's upset or about to cry, or even depressed, although perhaps disappointed and maybe slightly wounded. Under these circumstances, Rochester's assessment makes him look self-important, sadistic and weird.\n\nAlthough, in this version (1997) I think Jane gets too passionate too soon, before Rochester has begun much transformation and become truly transparent and honest which I think took a bit away from the credibility. Then again, Jane comes from Lowood.\n\nBottom line: For delicate, complex development, sensitive performances, and for sparing us the stuff we don't need much of in favor of the parts that need the time to develop, I give it five. Nicely done.","summary":"The best of the four adaptaions I've seen so far","unixReviewTime":1232582400,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

The actors playing Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester just do not have the correct chemisty. (Disclaimer: I must admit that I always liked Timothy Dalton's performance in the 1983 BBC version, so my judgement might be impaired)\n\n(3) The film does not develop the relationship between Jane and St. John Rivers nearly as much as it should have. Hence, it might be difficult for the viewer who has not read the novel to realize what a difficult choice Jane must make when she decides to refuse St. John's offer.\n\nI recommend the following:\n\n(1) Jane Eyre (1983) with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke - a BBC production totaling 311 minutes\n\n(2) Jane Eyre (2006) with Ruth Wilson (II); Toby Stephens - a Masterpiece Theatre production totaling 228 minutes\n\nNote:\nHowever, I enjoyed this version more than the Jane Eyre (2003) Miramax production with  William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg.","summary":"Not the Best Version...Not the Worst","unixReviewTime":1230854400,"vote":null,"image":null}

New and rediculous scenes are created such as Rochester and Jane running into Blanche Ingram in town while shopping for their wedding. Blanche herself is unattractive and too nice.\nMost of the people in this movie act out of character.

Morton was 20 years old and the closest in age to the young orphaned governess, childlike in the appearance but strong willed, serene yet very intelligent with acute sense of right or wrong. Two years prior to her Oscar nominated role as a mute girl in Woody Allen's \"Sweet and Lowdown\", Morton proved that she could say a lot by the mere look at her face, by her impressive and speaking eyes alone. It is sad that the film took too many liberties with the book and not only in omitting many important plot lines in order to fit in its 108 minutes length, but with too many changes to the very nature of the novel's two main characters and their relationship. Jane in the scenes with her employer is sometimes too demanding and not as tactful as she is in the book. The changes are especially obvious in Mr. Edward Rochester as he was played by Ciaran Hinds. Hinds is a talented, intense actor but I can't agree or like his reading and interpreting of Mr. Rochester's character. Some his scenes in the film made me cringe. Mr. Edward Rochester of the novel was not yelling or rather barking brute - it was difficult for me to believe that Jane Eyre would come to love so much. I also was unpleasantly surprised with Mr. Rochester openly displaying his affection for Adele.

He also didn't have Mr. Rochester's dark wit.  If you want to see Ciaran Hinds in a wonderful movie, see Jane Austen's \"Persuasion.\"\n\nSamantha Morton, although a great actress here, played Jane far too impertinent for her position, the era and most importantly for the post-Helen Jane who had a gentle spirit that made Mr. Rochester drawn to her in the first place.\n\nI was glad to see the Bertha portrayal was very close to the book in this one as well as the 83' version.  Unlike, the most recent Masterpiece version that had Bertha looking like she could step out of Thornfield, put on a gown and walk the red carpet.\n\nIf you want to see a great and TRUE adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's \"Jane Eyre,\" watch the Timothy Dalton\/Zelah Clarke version  which still is powerful even after 24 years. Timothy Dalton is the book's tumultous, playful, introspective and passionate Mr. Rochester.

No heartbreak, no horror, no sense of Jane's virtue, tough interior and self-reliance, which helped her overcome so many of life's obstacles. Not even much atmospheric scenery. This Mr. Rochester, played by the usually-excellent Ciaran Hines, is utterly forgettable, weak, and miscast. He doesnt have to be handsome, but he does have to be powerful, passionate, sexy, and seething. After all, he keeps a mad wife locked in the attic and he tries to keep that secret while almost commiting bigamy.\n\nInstead, try the Timothy Dalton version which is excellent though now a little low-budget looking,  or the 2007 even sexier and faster-paced version with Toby Stevens and Ruth Wilson, which is outstanding and the best yet.

I couldn't sit through it again.\n\nMy favorite version of Jane Eyre is still the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton - good dialogue, fine acting, and great film score, plus at 311 minutes the original story remains pretty much in tact.\n\nI also love Timothy Dalton's version of Wuthering Heights - never a dry eye at the end of that one.  Beautiful, haunting film score.","summary":"Cliff Notes Version","unixReviewTime":1128988800,"vote":12.0,"image":null}

I infinitely prefer the William Hurt adaptation of the novel.\n\nFirst off, the film quality and color of this film were very poor. It was washed out and altogether too bland. Also, the acting was poor in my opinion. Samantha Morton was not very believable as Jane Eyre and the actor who plays Mr. Rochester was altogether unappealing. The two actors had no spark or chemistry to speak of, and the relation of love by Mr. Rochester later in the film is wholly unbelievable and poorly delivered. He ruins one of the best lines in the novel (the one with the bit of string tied to his heart and Jane's). Also, although Mr. Rochester is not handsome, this actor was just uglier than I had imagined Mr. Rochester to be. But, that would be of little account if he also did not portray Mr. Rochester as just plain rude. He ordered about Jane in a brutish manner, levied insults, barked out his lines and was very dull. Why Jane would be attracted to him (beyond being lonely and not having the company of any other man) is beyond me. The portryal of Jane was also a dull one and her constant voice overs were really annoying. A film is supposed to show us the story, not tell us the story. There was far too much telling of Jane felt or about her past, and far too little demonstration. I was told Jane loved Mr. Rochester, but from watching the film I found that very hard to believe. Jane also seemed to be rude and disrespectful on purpose, rather than observant and forthright as she is in the novel. She doesn't mean to offend, but truthfully answers questions and speaks her mind. The movie would have you think she is just catty. Also, she always looks so annoyed with Mr. Rochester.\n\nOverall, I regret buying this film. I wished I put my $5 dollars towards the William Hurt adaptation which more accurately captures the emotion and spirit of the novel, if not all the exact details.","summary":"Very poor movie.

Both Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton commit to their roles with passion.  Like the characters in the novel, neither is conventionally beautiful; they are riveting because of the emotional force they bring to their parts.  At times, Hinds was a little too gruff as Rochester, but it never went over the top; he looked the part of Mr. Rochester and in my opinion acted it incredibly well.  And Samantha Morton is luminous - she may wear plain clothing and sport a ridiculous hair style, but she shines.

And, yes, I liked the book.

The key to Mr. Rochester's character is in the scene in which he tells Jane about his \"grand passion\" and how he was betrayed by the woman he adored.  Juxtapose this against the first Mrs. Rochester's passion for him that overset her reason.\nSamantha Morton does a lovely job of portraying an innocent who is not ignorant of the darker aspects of human nature-- Lowood School taught her more than reading, writing and geography.  Her plummet into the pain of the truth and then her coming to understand the power of the passion that grips her is very well played.\nIf I want to re-experience my version of Jane Eyre I will reread the book.

First, the writers took great 'liberties' with the novel that detract, rather than enhance, the characters.  The best two examples involve the main characters of Mr. Rochester and Jane.  In the book, Rochester is a brooding, singular figure who is very much a victim of the cruel plotting and vices of others.  But in this film version, he is cruel and vindictive in and of himself.  Vengeful, plotting, and profane, you have little reason to see why Jane would ever attach herself to such a worthless creature.  Jane of course does fall in love with him, but because he is so repugnant, the viewer can hardly see any reason why.  Thus, Jane is herself reduced greatly from a woman who loves unconditionally - -as was shown in the book- -to a strange, misguided young woman racked with a codependent psyche.  The second area in which this version is inferior to the book, and the other far superior film versions (particularly the William Hurt version) is its brevity.  It is only 90 minutes long.  It leaves out so many of the small aspects that would normally give vitality and life to the characters.  Being that it is such a poor version, this is not necessarily all that bad, but willing to give the film chance after chance to redeem itself, it falls terribly short on nearly every measure.","summary":"Definitely the Worst of the TV\/Movie Adaptions","unixReviewTime":1041897600,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

I liked it when I first saw it, but had the nagging feeling that something was missing.  So I re-read the book, and discovered exactly what was missing -- about 1\/4 of the book.  Among the scenes that were missing were the other reasons behind Jane's return to Thornfield.\nAnd then there's Samantha Morton.  I cannot think of a film where I liked her, so that is another strike against this version.\nSome have said that Timothy Dalton is \"too handsome\" to play Rochester.  Perhaps he is.  But he is such an incredible actor that I will forgive him. *grin*  I do appreciate Ciaran Hinds, and it pains me to say that I did not like him as Rochester. I read someplace that he hadn't read the book before making this film.  Well, it shows.  He rants and raves too much; there was no subtlety in his performance.  And subtlety is something Dalton understood in his performance.\nAn adaptation does not need to be a word-for-word translation from page to screen, but it does have to retain the spirit of the original for me to appreciate it, and this version does neither, so I cannot find much to like about it.","summary":"I just can't like this version.","unixReviewTime":1040083200,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

I enjoyed the rapid transitions, cut-aways and voice overs. It tells the story of the novel in a most interesting way.\nI think Samantha Morton makes an excellent Jane Eyre. She really captures Jane's innocent yet vibrantly alive spirit. Morton exudes the very fairy-like, impish qualities that Mr. Rochester is always describing her as having in the book. I think she is the best Jane I have see portrayed although I do enjoy Charlotte Gainesborough's and Joan Fontaine's work as Jane as well.\nCiran Hinds did equally as well. I think the two actors really displayed the chemistry that existed potently between Jane and Rochester. This kiss under the tree was remarkable!\nThe settings and lighting in this version are much better than in the 1983 Timothy Dalton version. And although Hinds is quite handsome in Persuasion, he actually becomes the more unattractive Rochester in this movie. Dalton, although a powerful performance in the miniseries in which he played Mr. Rochester, could never really be considered \"ugly.\" Hinds is a more credible Rochester and very true to Charlotte Bronte's novel.\nI highly recommend and enjoy this version of Jane Eyre.

Instead of sticking to the words in the book as closely as possible, she completely rewrote the dialogue. What arrogance! The result is that both Rochester and Jane say things that are completely out of character to anyone that's read the book. \"I feel your passions are aroused\"? I found myself screaming at the screen \"he'd never say that!\"\nMy second main objection was how Ciaran Hinds was directed to play Rochester. I blame the director because I've seen Hinds in many movies and know the range of emotion he can display. In this version he was essentially one-note: he shouts all the time. The ONLY time he softens is in the bedroom with Jane after the fire. That one scene showed me what could have been, and only sharpened my disappointment with the rest.

However, George C. Scott did a very good, very restrained Rochester in his later version and this version presents a very good Rochester as well.  Morton as Jane Eyre confirms my earlier opinion from her performance in \"Sweet And Low Down\" that she is an actress to watch.  As far as faithfulness to the novel, I really don't demand that from films which are a very different creative medium from novels. The basic story has become a timeless classic, often copied but never equaled.  Jane is a poor orphan who becomes a governess for Rochester's ward.  He is a wealthy man with a beautiful estate.  They fall in love but a horrible dilemma from his past comes forth to haunt them both.\n\nVisit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

They only had this version of Jane Eyre and was hesitant to watch it because I had never heard of the actors before. As the movie started I noticed that  it skipped the beginning of the book (began at the red-room incident)and  spent more time towards Jane Eyre as an adult. When I first saw Ciaran  Hinds (Mr. Rochester) I thought - this man isn't very attractive and he is  really mean!  Jane Eyre will never fall for him! But, Mr. Hinds played the  role wonderfully and even I looked beyond his roughness and fell inlove  with the character!  Samantha Morton played a wonderful Jane Eyre and I  really felt the chemistry between the two throughout the movie.  I think my  favorite scene was when he was waiting for Jane to get back from preparing  for her aunts funeral and was very jealous.  And the ending made me cry!  I  later rented a different version of Jane Eyre with William Hurt in it, and  disliked it very much.  There was no chemistry between the lead actors and  I was glad that I rented this version first!","summary":"Excellent Chemistry!","unixReviewTime":964569600,"vote":22.0,"image":null}

It reflects the tensions between masters and servants, between different categories of servants, and between the existing order and those who do not fully accept it--servants who aspire to careers outside of domestic service, persons motivated by middle-class values, and the nouveau riche who respect money and power more than tradition.  Both upstairs and downstairs residents are influenced by British imperialism and xenophobia.\n\nBritish actresses Jean Marsh and Eileen Atkins conceived U\/D as a comedy focused on the downstairs staff.  But it gradually evolved into a drama about the entire household--both upstairs and downstairs.  London Weekend producer Cyril Bennett did not believe that U\/D would be successful.  He held Series 1 off the air for six months, then chose to broadcast it at 10:15 on Sunday nights.  Despite this scheduling, the show became one of the most popular PBS programs of all time.\n\nThe household is headed by Richard Bellamy (David Langton), the son of a clergyman, who has married Lady Marjorie, scion of the prominent Southwold family.  As a political and social conservative, Richard attains high administrative offices, but, as a member of Parliament, he prefers to vote according to his conscience rather than the Southwold family's preferences.  Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) is imperious and aristocratic.  Their son James (Simon Williams), an army officer, is plagued by such bad judgment that we generally cannot sympathize with him.  His sister Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett) is idealistic and romantic, but unrealistic.  Her relations with the male sex always turn out badly, until (having left U\/D after Series 2) she is said to have found marital happiness in America.  Following Marjorie's death, management of the household falls to James's new wife Hazel (Meg Wynn Owen), the daughter of an accountant, who is guided by different values than other members of the Bellamy family.  Marjorie's niece Georgina (Lesley-Anne Down) arrives in Series 3, with a sense of idealism and adventure.  After the war, Richard marries Virginia (Hannah Gordon), who provides companionship and support.\n\nThe downstairs staff is directed by the butler, Hudson (Gordon Jackson), who relies on discipline to preserve traditional standards, and discretion to prevent scandal, but can be sympathetic when the occasion warrants.  Mrs. Bridges (Angela Baddeley), the cook, overcomes kitchen crises and follows household gossip.  Rose (Jean Marsh), the head house parlor maid, later ladies maid, is devoted to the family, but occasionally expresses dissatisfaction with her \"place\" in the system.  Under house parlor maid Sarah (Pauline Collins) makes up in imagination what she lacks in education; anxious to escape domestic service, she becomes a chorus girl.  Chauffeur Thomas Watkins (John Alderton) is something of a con-artist, but he evidently has genuine affection for Sarah.  Under house parlor maid Daisy (Jacqueline Tong) marries footman Edward (Christopher Beeny) and attempts to advance his career.  At the bottom of the servants' hierarchy is the kitchen maid Ruby (Jenny Tomasin).\n\nInterestingly, all the award nominations went to the downstairs actors, although it seemed to this reviewer that nearly all the actors put in strong performances.  Two personal favorites are Raymond Huntley's portrayal of the very formal, punctilious, and bespectacled family solicitor, Sir Geoffrey Dillon; and Jenny Tomasin's performance as the uneducated and unrespected scullery maid Ruby.  Tomasin took to heart Jackson's comment that there were no small parts, only small actors, and her rendering of Ruby may become a model for future actresses.  Fortunately, there are occasions on which Ruby knows more than the other servants, and when she shows initiative by leaving 165 Eaton Place to take a factory job, and by soliciting correspondence through a dating service--these events prevent Ruby from becoming a caricature.\n\nThe 68 episodes vary in quality; but there are few really poor ones.  The stories deal with a wide range of matters, including family relations, infidelity, divorce, inappropriate pregnancies, miscarriages, espionage, murder, suicide, casualties of war, politics, and the consequences of prosperity and depression.  Many episodes are connected to such real events as the death of Edward VII, World War I, the Silvertown munitions factory explosion, the 1926 General Strike, and the Stock Market Crash.  The producers gave great attention to verisimilitude -for example, consulting with Buckingham Palace staff regarding protocol for hosting the king's visit to 165 Eaton Place.\n\nMany viewers consider Series 1 (1903-1909) the least successful.  (Most of this series was not aired in the U.S. until many years later.)  It had a lower budget than subsequent series; and, due to a technicians' strike, the first half dozen episodes were filmed in black and white.  Writers, directors, and actors were still trying to set the parameters for the program.  As a result, this series includes several strange stories; and some characters (especially the footman Alfred), lack credibility.  Some performances are too loud, too demonstrative, and poorly choreographed.  Many of the stories in Series 2 (1908 - 1910) provide various perspectives on marriage; others deal with problems created by a superannuated nanny and by Elizabeth's suffrage activities.  King Edward VII is a dinner guest in one episode; and this series ends with his death.  Series 3 (1912 - 1914) witnesses the arrival of Hazel Forrest as Richard Bellamy's secretary, and her marriage to James Bellamy.  Lady Marjorie having died on the Titanic, Hazel assumes the management of the household.  She eventually overcomes downstairs resentment; but her middle-class outlook leads to clashes with Richard and James.  This series ends with the outbreak of World War I.  The war casts a shadow over Series 4 (1914-1918), which many consider the best.  The Bellamys take in a family of Belgian refugees, James Bellamy and footman Edward join the army, other members of the household take on war-related duties; and a local baker, of German descent, becomes a victim of anti-German hysteria.  The war impacts the household in various ways--the staff must dine on ersatz meat and potatoes, James comes home severely wounded, and the house is hit by a bomb.  Series 5 (1919-1930) deals with life in the 1920s.  Richard finds happiness with his new wife Virginia.  But old values are challenged, as the younger generation engage in wild parties and other reckless behavior, aided by such new technologies as autos, airplanes, and motion pictures.  As a result of the stock market crash and the Depression, both upstairs and downstairs residents must leave Eaton Place to start new lives elsewhere.\n\nIt has been said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery; and U\/D has had several imitators, including Beacon Hill (1975), as well as a new&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Upstairs-Downstairs-2010\/dp\/B004N66XYE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Upstairs, Downstairs (2010)<\/a>&nbsp;.  But the program's real heir is&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Masterpiece-Classic-Downton-Abbey-Seasons-1-6-Complete-Collections-with-Bonus\/dp\/B01BU3PWC6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey - Seasons 1-6 Complete Collections with Bonus<\/a>&nbsp;(2010-  ).  Consider the similarities:  In both the wealth comes from the woman's side of the family.  Both Richard (U\/D) and Robert (DA) are in precarious financial situations:  When Marjorie dies, the family fortune goes to Richard's children.  Without a male heir, Downton Abbey will go to another branch of the family.  In both programs:  (1) family members die (or appear to die) on the Titanic, (2) the young men are involved in World War I (in each, the principal young male character, after being missing in action, returns home gravely wounded; in each household, one of the domestic servants suffers from shell shock); (3) a young female member of the family becomes a wartime nurse; (4) a young woman dies from influenza; (5) there is a downstairs romance; (6) there is a homosexual footman; (6) a male aristocrat refuses to take responsibility for a child he has fathered by a maid; (7) an adventurous young daughter gets into trouble from her involvement in the suffrage movement; (8) the cook is courted by an unworthy suitor; (9) the question arises as to who will fill in for the ailing butler; (10) the household feels obliged to dismiss an unsatisfactory nanny; and (11) the family suffers from making bad investments.  Well, you get the idea.\n\nThis 21-disc set provides several supplementary features.  (1) The production of each Series is documented in an accompanying program, featuring interviews with writers, directors, actors.  (2) \"Russell Harty Goes Upstairs, Downstairs\" (1975), in which talk show host Russell Harty visits cast members on the set shortly after the final episode was broadcast.  (3) \"Upstairs Downstairs Remembered\" (1996), narrated by Gareth Hunt, in which cast members give accounts of behind-the-scenes problems and accomplishments.  (4)  In \"Sandy's Last Stand\" (2006), composer Alexander Faris describes how he wrote the theme music, including the \"upstairs\" theme and the \"downstairs\" theme (\"What are We Going to Do With Uncle Arthur?\").  This includes performances of both the original 4\/4 and the more familiar 3\/4 versions of the upstairs theme, and the downstairs theme.\n\nUpstairs Downstairs was the product of 9 writers and 8 directors.  Hence, there are some inconsistencies in the details and in the portrayal of characters.  There are relatively few scene changes; and the program often has the feel of a stage production.  Images of many outdoor scenes, which were filmed with smaller cameras, have noticeably lower resolution.  The 2010 Acorn release, on which this review is based, is said to be better than the previous A & E versions.  But, like some other reviewers, I have experienced a few problems with it.  Several episodes freeze.  I have not had similar problems with other Acorn products. [See NOTE below.] A list of all 68 episodes, indicating the discs on which they were reproduced, would have been a very desirable addition to this set.  I have compiled such a list and attached a copy inside the jewel case for each series; this enables me to go directly to the appropriate disc for whatever episode I wish to see.\n\nBy informal count, Upstairs Downstairs was nominated for 17 Emmys and received 7, most significantly, 4 successive awards for outstanding dramatic series.  It was nominated for 9 BAFTA awards and received 2; and was nominated for 4 Golden Globe Awards and received 1.  It also received a Peabody Award, a Royal Television Society Award; and its theme song won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Theme From a Radio or Television Production.  The program could have continued beyond five years, but the actors, writers, and directors chose to end it.  Cyril Bennett, who had been reluctant to air the program in the first place, pleaded vociferously, but ineffectively, with John Hawkesworth that the program should be  extended  for another ten years.  Thus, there have been no further episodes of this outstanding drama.\n\nChristopher Hodson, who directed 14 episodes, described U\/D as \"the sort of series that doesn't come along more than once in a lifetime.\"  Few would disagree.\n\n[NOTE:  The sticking problem seems to result from a spindle hole that is slightly too small.  Enlarging the spindle hole by as little as .001 of an inch with the aid of a round mini-file or fine sandpaper seems to correct the problem. Perhaps some other reviewer can explain why this is so.  Needless to say, be careful not to damage any other surfaces of a CD! ]","summary":"One of the Best Dramas of All Time","unixReviewTime":1381363200,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

It contains 68 episodes on 20 DVDs, plus one DVD with quite a few bonus features The first season comprises 13 episodes and the first episodes seem spare, especially in the dialog--more like stage plays than video dramas of today's miniseries.  Later episodes lose that stagey-ness and become very involved dramas. Since the original series broadcast in the US did not include the black-and-white episodes,  I was not familiar with the development of the series and how it grew from a rather simple initial season to rather involved arcs. For that ALONE, I'd recommend this set of DVD's because seeing them all in series is fascinating. And I saw entirely new episodes (for me) as I'd missed a lot of the first seasons, being off at college and without a television for some years.\n\nI was also able to look at the opening titles with the drawings from \"Punch\" (A British humor magazine) and admire how the producers selected amazingly apt drawings to fit the particular episode.\n\nSome of the initial episodes, sadly, are recorded only in black and white due to a technicians' strike in the early 70's. It doesn't actually detract from the enjoyment, just makes it a bit sad we can't see the sets and costuming as they were filmed. The black & white are sharp and clear, but the color episodes can be somewhat lower in resolution. The colors can be dim as well, but it doesn't detract. The cropping is often odd. This is not a perfect conversion from the television to DVD, but it's adequate and probably a lot has to do with changes in technologies since the 70's and the early days of television-to-DVD remastering.\n\nThe extras are lavish:\n Extras:\n\n5-part documentary: The Making of Upstairs Downstairs\n24 episode commentaries\nUpstairs, Downstairs Remembered - with Gareth Hunt (51:50)\nRussell Harty Goes Upstairs Downstairs (30:00)\nSandy's Last Stand with composer Alexander Faris (13:15)\nSimon Williams and Alfred Shaughnessy in Conversation (22:50)\n\"Russell Harty Plus\" Interview with Gordon Jackson (6:40)\n\"Russell Harty Plus\" Interview with Jean Marsh (11:15)\n\"Russell Harty Plus\" Interview with Angela Baddeley (9:40)\n Alternate version of Episode 1 \"On Trial\"\n Essay by star and co-creator Jean Marsh\n\nIt's nice to go visit old friends again and have all the episodes and extras. There is a lot of value here, plenty to watch and re-watch, especially if you are a fan of BBC historical drama series. If you are a fan of \"Downton Abbey\" and don't know this series, you are in for a treat.","summary":"Like Downton Abbey?

Richard","reviewText":"I remember hearing about this series when I was a kid. Probably during the original US run in the 70's. I think they reran it after that. I can remember watching part of one episode, but it didn't appeal to me. Well, maybe I was too young to appreciate it.\n\nFast forward to a few months ago. Now middle aged, I decided to give this series another try. At first, it seemed OK, but I wasn't sure if I'd want to spend the time getting through the whole series. Didn't seem quite as well done as more recent British TV. But, I watched a few more episodes and got more interested. Before I knew it, I was on the 5th and last series and realized I was almost done. I was sad to see the last episode end. The characters seemed almost like old friends by then.\n\nI think the first episode is set in 1903 and the last in 1930. Many characters come and go, but many appear in the whole run like Mr. Hudson, Mrs. Bridges, Rose and Richard Bellamy.\n\nThe British class system in all its \"glory\" is illustrated as the series rolls on. And how it starts to unravel a bit as time moves forward. I guess as an American, it is hard to believe how those lower on the food chain put up with this system, but I guess we had something similar at the time here, but maybe less rigid. I'm told that the British still retain a bit of the old system even today, while we seem to have been a little more successful at getting rid of our old system.\n\nBut, I think one positive point that is often overlooked about the old system is well illustrated. There was some sense of family ties of a sort between the upstairs family and the long time servants downstairs.\n\nThe series did try to bring to life the big events going on at the time the series is set. It also showed how the upstairs people and the servants saw these events in very similar ways in many cases. I was surprised at how the servants were so often in agreement with the upstairs people on politics. Maybe they all valued stability and tradition very much and so agreed on the politics as a result.\n\nSometimes the formality of the interactions between the upstairs folk and the servants was almost comical, but it was still kind of nice to see it at times. We seem to live in a world without much in the way of good manners anymore.\n\nI'm sure that much has been written on the details of the series already by other reviewers, so I don't think there is much I could add there. So, I'll just say that this is a great series to watch and well worth the time required to watch all the episodes.\n\nThere was a continuation series that aired recently which I did watch well before I got far along in the old series reviewed here.  They don't seem all that related to me now that I have seen all of both. The new series was not very popular and didn't last very long. Two short seasons maybe. I thought it was OK.","summary":"Great Series","unixReviewTime":1371513600,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

However, since I am such a fan of Downton Abbey, I thought I would give it a try. And I am so glad I did. It begins in 1903 when there were still horse drawn carriages and strict rules of decorum, and goes through WWI, the roaring twenties, and into the Great Depression. I found the families very enduring, both upstairs and downstairs, and their struggles very real. You will love the characters: Mrs. Bridges, Ruby, Mr. Hudson, Rose, Edward, Sara, Thomas, Fredrick, and Daisy, and last, but not least, the Bellamy family and their friends.\n\nIt does not necessarily have a happy ending, but it is a satisfying one. I will be sure to watch this series again and again. I think it gives a good insight into the history of the time as well as telling an enduring story. It shows the decline of the noble class in England, how it began and came about. That was a little sad to me because I think we lost something of elegance and grace along the way to progress, and I could not help feeling that I wished we had at least some of it back. All in all, this is a very good series. I wish there had been more of it. I would have liked to seen what happened to the characters during the Great Depression.\n\nThe newer, more modern, series is also good, but sadly it was not renewed so it really does not have an ending, happy or otherwise. I was really looking forward to see how England survived WWII. Perhaps they will rethink the decision to cancel it and bring it back. These, like then, are hard times we live in, and it always helps to see a good drama to make you feel better.","summary":"enjoyed it.","unixReviewTime":1365465600,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

This is the best written,best acted television drama I have ever viewed.\n  Where the modern day drama of \"Downton Abbey\" has characters that are cold and stiff. The writers of Downton Abbey leave out the humanity and underlying connectedness and dependence they all share with one another.\n  The writers of \"Upstairs Downstairs\" leave in the details of the human relationships that the characters have, as they act out the scenes.\n  An innate understanding of the characters is displayed, by each actor playing their part. A full picture of each character is revealed in scenes that show the characters motive, thought process, and conflict. A real understanding of human nature, class structure, and culture was known by the writers of this Magnificent piece of television history.\n  When one watches these stories you can see the heart, the soul, the humanity of the characters in the story. The show is not written pandering to one class or the other class, such amateur writing you will not see in Upstairs Downstairs.\n  What you will see are the trials, the laughter, the heartache, and love that both; the servants below and the Lords above go through in their journey  through life together. When the series ends you come to an understanding that these people all of them shared a life, with all of its ups, and downs, that they loved and relied on one another, just like a family does.","summary":"A Masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1362960000,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

Somehow I never saw it when it was aired on PBS and the discs were a bit pricy for a 'hope it's good' purchase.\n\nFinally I found this 40th Anniversary set -- produced by Acorn -- at an irresistible price and took the plunge.\n\nMy wife and I sat down and watched episodes 1 through 3 and each of us had the same reaction. What was all the fuss about?  Upstairs Downstairs seemed to be a mediocre, low-budget, Brit sitcom and nothing more. We took a few days off and then decided to give it another go. And are we glad we did! For starting in episode 4 the entire feel of the series changed from a cheap sitcom to thoughtful human drama.\n\nOkay, the \"cheap\" feeling stayed for somewhat longer. Only as the years went by did the production values start to go a bit upscale.  Never near the level of something like Downton Abbey, mind you, but good enough to become invisible.\n\nThe production and mastering of the Acorn set is so-so at best, both as to image and sound quality and the interface. (Oh, the junk you have to sit through on each year's disc one before the program starts! Ugh!) And instead of defaulting to having no subtitles 4 out of the 5 sets defaulted to subtitles on. Grrr!\n\nBut the drama itself is the thing and all that technical stuff pales into insignificance once we got absorbed into the characters and the stories. This is human drama as real as life -- full of the complexities, ambiguities, triumphs, joys, disappointments and sorrows of real life and told with feeling and an underlying appreciation for what it means to be human.  As such Upstairs Downstairs is highly recommended.","summary":"Know I Know What All The Fuss Was About","unixReviewTime":1359590400,"vote":7.0,"image":null}

I enjoyed the show immensely, it was really rather a first offering of PBS, then known primarily as a fledgling \"artsy\" station, presenting this hitherto unknown British series through WGBH in Boston. From its first episode, Up\/Down oozed quality in every way: superb acting, writing, direction, production, with the added bonus of Alistair Cooke's introduction, while seated in a leather armchair next to a roaring fire prior to each episode, to the accompaniment of the famous Masterpiece Theatre theme, Mouret's Rondo, which added to the understated elegance and anticipation of each episode.\n\n The characters of Up\/Down were many faceted and always interesting, not merely presented as one-dimensional, i.e., rich versus poor. One could even sympathize with the clueless and wealthy Bellamy family on occasion, theirs was a cocoon of privilege and comfort, yet their breeding never eschewed vulgarity or crassness, but embraced kindness, concern and responsible humanity toward their Downstairs \"family\". Similarly, their Downstairs family, in turn, showed respect, warm feelings of pride of service and true concern for their \"upstairs\" family as well. The viewer was entwined in the lives of both \"families\", experiencing their joys, sorrows and frustrations. All within a 25 year framework encompassing the Victorian and Edwardian ages, culminating in the death of Edward VII, the sinking of the Titanic and loss of Lady Marjorie Bellamy, World War I and its aftermath, the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression, forever changing the world of the Bellamys first shown in 1904. Up\/Down is, simply, a breathtakingly unforgettable series.\n\nThis 40th anniversary release is equal to the many superlatives written on these pages of reviews. I had VHS taped some of the original Up\/Down episodes when they were re-shown on PBS in the 80's, which I still have. However, I wanted the DVD version, and decided to purchase this 40th anniversary set through Amazon.  Let me say that it is simply superb in every way.\n\nThe episodes have been remastered to splendid effect, they are all excellent in both video and audio quality. I do not understand how some of the reviewers could state that they are not! They are all exceptionally good.  There are 21 DVD's in this set, with an added 25 hours of extras, narrating the making of Up\/Down,interviews with many of the characters who are still living, and they seem to enjoy reminiscing, sharing many little unknown facts about the particular episodes being presented. Priceless. There are also narratives and commentaries in the episodes by some of the actors, scene selection, and an enclosed brief written narrative by Jean Marsh, one of the co-creators who also portrayed Rose, the under-house parlor maid. The audio commentaries by the actors and writers on each episode are great fun, listening to Jean Marsh and Simon Williams' comments give one a marvelous insider perspective. This is the definitive collection, it just doesn't get much better than this. I urge all Up\/Down devotees, new and old, to purchase it. Also, the price on Amazon is about the lowest I have seen anywhere. It is well worth the price for this timeless and iconic series, presented as grandly as the series itself. Don't miss it.","summary":"Quintessential remastering with many extras! Superb!","unixReviewTime":1308009600,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

This 27-year span epic won 9 Emmys, 2 BAFTAs, Golden Globe & a Peabody Award, 31 nominations. The aristocratic Bellamy's of 165 Eaton Place, London, live upstairs over the downstairs clockwork servant aid led by butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson). Classic Edwardian masterful plots in this funny and dramatic back time-travel over 3 decades inside the Bellamy house. A crowning British achievement in the 70's and worth owning today.\n\nSir Richard Bellamy MP (David Langton) and Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) have heir Lt James (Simon Williams) and Miss Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett-`A Bit of a Do') who need quite a crew downstairs to keep their house in order. Mrs. Bridges (Angela Brddeley) cooks up a storm, while maid Rose (Jean Marsh, co-creator) helps keep linens and affairs tidy. The pilot (an alternate plot pilot available) introduces new servant Sarah (Pauline Collins), who adds saucy spice to the house on both ends of the stairs. Footman Alfred (George Innes) who quotes Bible, Perce (Brian Osborne) is lady's-man coachman during carriage years, Thomas (John Alderton) chauffeur in later auto episodes. The star studded cast is endless.\n\nThis new release provides 21 discs in 5 solid cases all in the anniversary storage sleeve. Quite an improvement from the earlier release. 68 episodes, each about 50 min. Add 25 bonus hrs and you have a value, not to mention the dynamic dramatic entertainment including romance, mystery, drama, historical significance, humor, suspense, & more. Episodes 2,3,4,5,&7 are B\/W due to a technicians strike. Pilot was remade in color. The features + bonus time total divided by the current Amazon price makes the HOURLY entertainment cost less than $1.87. A VALUE!\n\nSUBTITLES-THIS SET OFFERS SUBTITLES. Helpful for some of us.  A Jean Marsh memories insert is included and created in Oct. 2010.\n\nSERIES 1: 1903-09, introduces cast, Bellamy house trials, scandal, love, and the delight of seeing the wonderfully differences between the working and upper classes. Great plots in every episode, too many to list. Always sub-plots, upstairs and downstairs. Delightful set and an array of costuming that shows both the upper and lower class dress of the times.\nSERIES 2: 1908-10, shows life with a newly married Bellamy, potential fatherhood, and romance downstairs too. All scandalous in high society, as is several topics this show dared to address in the 70s. Cast members playing Sarah and Thomas would eventually marry in real-life.\nSERIES 3: 1912-14, the period finds Kind Edward VII is dead and pending war. World war and politics are just a fraction of the turmoil found at house 165. Love upstairs and downstairs is as treacherous as the war trenches. Reason enough for this seasons' best drama series Emmy & Golden globe.\nSERIES 4: 1914-18, the Great War is happening, and it touches the Bellamy house stairway ends. Another 2 Emmys won due to struggles with soldiering, war efforts, changes in lifestyle due to war, and love at all times. A fine dramatic, but historical look at WWI, on the London home front.\nSERIES 5: 1919-30, the largest span of time. War's end. The 1920's roar, and that impacts the family upstairs as well as the lively help downstairs. But even war fails to change some things, like scandal, family disgrace, celebrations, and again the outstanding drama series Emmy and the prestigious Peabody Award.\n\nAfter the airing of \"The Forsyte Saga\" (a must series also), Eileen Atkins and Jean Marsh dreamed up the \"Upstairs Downstairs\" concept. Jean stared as Rose in the 70s TV blockbuster, and now continues that role in the continuation of the story on Brit TV (Dec '10). 3 episodes advance the story now to 1936, with a new cast (excepting Marsh) and also now including Atkins as Maud, the same house, same music, same title. After \"Upstairs Downstairs\" the pair of actresses combined again in creating \"The House of Eliott\", another period saga, bloody good Brit drama, an absolute must own \"complete collection.\"\nThere you have my lengthy opinion, but so much in this anniversary edition. Worth the price. My final recommendation: BUY \"Upstairs Downstairs 40th Anniversary Ed\", \"The Forsyte Sage\", and \"the House of Eliott.\"","summary":"40th Anniversary Set a prize saga to own","unixReviewTime":1297036800,"vote":27.0,"image":null}

Most Americans saw the series when it ran on local PBS stations and later cable's A&E channel, while Canadians viewed it via the CBC.\n\n The series dealt with the rich and the poor and as any lover of soap opera knows when you pit these two types of people together fireworks will ignite. Indeed a soap, \"Upstairs, Downstairs\" dealt with the rich Bellamy family living in the high class Belgravia neighborhood in London. Their lives were intertwined by their servants who lived \"downstairs\" and who wanted to attain the richness and social standing of their employers. World War 1 was the backdrop for the serial which only added extra drama to the show.\n\n \"Upstairs, Downstairs\" is known as the series where many Hollywood leading ladies received their start, most notably Jean Marsh (who had a hand in the creation of the show) and Lesley-Ann Down, most famous for her role in \"North and South\" and currently starring in \"The Bold and the Beautiful\".\n\n This beautiful box set contains 21 DVD's featuring all the show's 68 episodes and has a plethora of extras that include over 25 hours of never-before-seen footage! The bonus features include a 5 part documentary called \"The Making of \"Upstairs, Downstairs\", 24 episode commentaries, interviews with cast members, and more. Sadly, when the producers went into the ITV archives to clean the show's original prints it was discovered the pilot had been \"wiped\" which was the custom for many British shows in the early seventies.\n\n The first two seasons of \"Upstairs, Downstairs\" (known as \"series\" in Britain) will be available individually with the release of the entire series box set. The remaining three seasons will be on store shelves before the end of 2011.\n\n The series has been revived on the BBC as of late 2010.","summary":"\"It's Tea Time!\"","unixReviewTime":1295308800,"vote":86.0,"image":null}

Over five seasons during the 1970s, Upstairs Downstairs riveted audiences in Britain, while in America, it more than any other series made Masterpiece Theater an essential part of Sunday evening television.\n\nUpstairs Downstairs is the story of the Bellamy family of 165 Eaton Place, London from about 1903 to 1930.  The Bellamys are an aristocratic family with a houseful of servants.  The interplay of story line and personality between Upstairs (the Bellamys and their friends and relatives) and Downstairs (the assorted servants) was beautifully done.  Some of the episodes tended to be a bit too soap operaish, but at its best the series was utterly spellbinding and memorable.\n\nThis megaset contains every episode of the original five seasons.  Some of the transfers are not all that clear, and a few of the openings have been truncated or even omitted entirely.  The megaset also contains a spin off of the series, Thomas and Sarah, based on the lives of two of the servants after they left 165.  Thomas and Sarah has nowhere near the quality of the original series and does not, in my opinion, deserve to be grouped with it.  But nevertheless this megaset is the best way to obtain and enjoy Upstairs Downstairs today.","summary":"Quintessential Excellence","unixReviewTime":1257465600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Danzig","reviewText":"What a pleasure to be able to watch every episode of \"Upstairs Downstairs\" at your own pace, with NO commercials or fundraising breaks!\n\nI was surprised watching this megaset how many episodes I don't recall ever seeing.  I'm not sure whether that's because I was out of the house at the time -- in the days before VCRs -- or because some of the episodes have elements reflecting the racism, anti-semitism, or other unfortunate aspects of the Edwardian age which U.S. networks elected not to broadcast.\n\nAt any rate, one need look no further than the brilliant first episode to see why this series is one of the best -- if not the single best -- historical drama ever, and every bit as captivating today as when it was originally broadcast.\n\nWith clockwork precision, the first episode introduces us to the aristocratic Bellamy family who live upstairs at 165 Eaton Place, and their staff of devoted servants working downstairs.  We see how the house functions, in particular the duties of the servants through the course of the day -- and we are introduced to one of the richest casts of characters this side of Dickens.\n\nThe steadfast and resourceful Hudson the butler, played by the late, great Gordon Jackson... the fastidious Mrs. Bridges the cook, played by Angela Baddeley... Rose the parlor maid, played by series co-creator Jean Marsh... Mr. and Lady Bellamy, played by David Langton and Rachel Gurney... their children James and Elizabeth, played by Simon Callow and Nicola Paget... all are indelible creations magnificently realized.\n\nIn the course of the series, the years from the first quarter of the twentieth century come to life with an unerring eye for detail, from the advent of electricity in the home to the adoption of the automobile to the crackle of the first crystal radios and early victrolas to the sinking of the Titanic to the horrors of World War I and the crash of the stock market in 1929.\n\nWatching the series again, I was moved to tears on a number of occasions.  I felt as if I was spending time with a dear family I hadn't seen in many years.\n\nThis megaset also includes a twenty-fifth anniversary special that reunited many of the cast members to reminisce about the production.  One of the most amusing anecdotes comes from series co-creator Marsh, who recalls that there were \"upstairs\" dressing rooms for the cast and \"downstairs\".  The former had windows and boxes of tissue; the latter did not.  The Bellamy family cast were automatically assigned the \"upstairs\" dressing rooms -- until Marsh finally spoke up and noted that as series co-creator, she deserved a box of tissues as much as Rachel Gurney!\n\nThen there is the spinoff series, \"Thomas and Sarah\", featuring the ever-scheming, never-succeeding former chauffeur and maid of the Bellamy household, which I consider more of a curiosity than a drama as compelling as \"Up Down\" itself.  Still it is a welcome inclusion for dedicated fans.\n\nI have deducted one star for the technical problems of this DVD set, which have been cited by other reviewers as well.  A&E obviously didn't lavish the same attention to detail on the mastering of these discs as the writers, directors, and actors who created the show, and it's a shame.  Especially annoying are the little boxes of \"digital dither\" that appear in the upper right corners of many episodes, plus the nonexistent color correction in others.\n\nStill, these technical issues detract only slightly from the breathtaking panoply of the drama unfolding here, and at a price around half that of the box set when it was first introduced, this megaset still merits inclusion in a British television enthusiast's collection.\n\nOne hopes, as others have noted, that A&E will eventually release an improved megaset that clears up these technical issues and perhaps includes another set of reminiscences from the series creators and television commentators.\n\nUntil then -- \"look sharp,\" as Hudson would say, and order this spectacular set to enjoy with your family!","summary":"The Greatest Drama Series Ever?","unixReviewTime":1253664000,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

When Amazon offered the Collector's Edition Megaset on a great sale, I couldn't pass it up.  I didn't really remember the series well, but I knew I very much wanted to see it.  Like others, I read the discouraging reviews about the A&E Home Video transfer, but I thought, I'm not really that picky and it's probably not all that bad.  Well, I am not that picky; I don't care about things being in HD or looking like a \"Harry Potter\" movie.  That said, I want readers to know, I was very, very disappointed in the visual and sound quality of A&Es Megaset.  So much so, I had given thought to sending this set back and exchanging it for another in hopes that it might be better.  But first I did some research.  I googled \"Why are the DVDs of A&E's Upstairs\/Downstairs so bad?\" and found an informative website which had a page on the US A&E version.  It made it clear that A&E Home Video had used old copies of the episodes for their remastering instead of getting new ones from the UK, undoubted a cost saving measure on their part.  As someone who has purchased many of these wonderful, older British series, I can tell you that the A&E version of the Joan Hickson \"Miss Marple\"s are not terribly good either, although they are certainly better than these sorry things. I have only taken a quick look at the two Thomas & Sarah DVDs and they do appear to be somewhat better than Upstairs\/Downstairs.  Hopefully, someday another company will release a quality set of the original series.","summary":"MORE ON THE DREADFUL A&E TRANSFER","unixReviewTime":1191888000,"vote":142.0,"image":null}

Troubles? Sure always troubles with both the wealthy family and troubles with the servants. But even in real life, it always has trouble, doesn't it.

The whole show is actually a time capsule during the time of pre-WWI UK and after (up to the US stock market crash in 1929.) It is very interesting to note the various stages of changes that were happening during that time. It's like a history lesson but with more fun in it (apologies to my History teacher.) In this, the makers of this wonderful miniseries did not fail in their mission to make things as authentic as possible. Personally, I cannot boast about knowing much about English soceity during the Edwardian era, for my knowledge of it actually comes from period movies and television programs that I had seen before. But when I said \"authentic,\" what I meant was that we can see and feel the labour of love that was put into every detail to make the show feel at home in its period setting.\n\nIn addition, this is no ordinary soap opera because it really has a lot of things to say about many issues. One might think that the people who inhabit the stories are shallow and uninteresting. After all, what can be interesting about the lives of parlourmaids, footmen, or drawing room ladies? But then, in \"Upstairs Downstairs,\" you will find otherwise because the writers somehow managed to give the stories and the characters flesh and blood, as well as humor and tears. Though dignified as the \"Upstairs\" masters may be, the writers prove that these people are not infallible, and that they are as susceptible to mistakes as any other class of human being. As for the \"Downstairs\" servants, though they toil all day long, we see that they do have lives of their own that are also interesting.\n\nHaving said the above, I guarantee that you will root for most of the characters. I love Lady Marjorie the best; captivating Georgina, no-nonsense Hazel, and Virginia as the second Mrs. Bellamy I love second. They are such adorable and charming people. I shall never forget that scene where Lady Marjorie tells Hudson the butler that \"the King will be dining with us next week.\" She was picture-perfect in that one. As for the men, I always admire Mr. Bellamy for his political convictions. Although we don't actually get to see the hearings in the House of Commons, we do get a firsthand look of what goes on behind the life of a parliament member. It is this aspect of the show that gives \"Upstairs Downstairs\" its political dimension. As for Elizabeth and James, I disliked them most of the time because they are spoiled, but they do have their human moments. Plus, Nicola Pagett and Simon Williams are such good, good actors. These two have some of the best parts in the whole series; Simon Williams, especially, as James, during the War years and after that.\n\nGoing now to the servants, there's Edward and his pretty wife Daisy. There's also Rose, who really lost a chance at the one happiness that she could have get (find it out for yourself.) Mr. Hudson, I sometimes find disappointing because of his prejudiced views. But during the times when he is in his right principles, you will admire him for it. Mrs. Bridges might be scoldy, but she really is a mother at heart, having no children of her own. It may surprise you to find out that she never had a husband. Ruby the scullery maid might be trivial, but she does have the spotlight in \"The Hero's Farewell,\" one of my favorite episodes. She also has a funny line at the final episode where she was contemplating that it won't be long before she gets the guesthouse all to herself. As for Thomas and the scene stealing Sarah, you will either like them or dislike them, but they do have their place in the story.\n\nThe last episode is a touching one, since we would have gotten used to the characters and feel that we know them already. I was sorry to see the members of the Bellamy household disbanded like that. I especially felt heart-pangs when Rose (Jean Marsh) was closing down the empty house. The ghosts of the past whispered into her ears as she did this, from floor to floor of 165 Eaton Place. These final few minutes of the show will not soon go away from your memory,.\n\nAs companions to this series, I would like to recommend the \"Berkeley Square\" Series and Stephen Poliakoff's \"The Lost Prince.\" Both of these can be had here at Amazon. There is no doubt that \"Berkeley Square\" had its roots in \"Upstairs Downstairs.\" To see \"Berkeley Square\" is to extend the enjoyment after viewing \"Upstairs Downstairs.\" But to get a better understanding of the political situation of the time period, I would recommend Stephen Poliakoff's \"The Lost Prince.\" This is considered to be one of Mr. Poliakoff's best works. I guarantee that \"Berkeley Square\" and \"The Lost Prince\" will not disappoint. Both are BBC productions.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the show, definitely a keeper. Some of the episodes might not be appropriate for younger viewers, as they touch on subjects about homosexuality, a murder, and suicides. The episode \"Alberto\" might also not be suitable for younger audiences, because it has an element worthy of an \"R\" rating. Other than that, it's mostly safe. The best part of the show was during the years of the War, when everybody had to make sacrifices, and when nothing was really certain. One lesson that the show teaches many a time is that WORDS CAN HURT. Parents will do wise to instill this into the minds of youngsters.\n\nA word about picture quality: since this is a show over thirty years of age, one mustn't give it a lot of expectations. I think there's a limit of what our current technology can do in the field of DVD transfer. I personally don't mind the sometimes grainy quality (plus the black and white of the first few episodes) because it gives it more vintage. What I do complain grievely about is the lack of subtitles; and, there's not much of a bonus feature.","summary":"Ten Stars for the Bellamy Household","unixReviewTime":1162080000,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

With sixty-eight 50-minute episodes, the series covers a time span of nearly 30 years (from early Edwardian England in 1903, through the horrors of the First World War, and on into the Roaring 20s, finally concluding with 1929's stock market crash). The setting is the household of the Bellamy family at 165 Eaton Place, London.  Upstairs live Richard Bellamy, MP, and his beautiful, aristocratic wife, Lady Margery. The Bellamys have two adult children, Captain James and Elizabeth, who come and go much like a recurring motif (though recurring nightmare might be more appropriate, for they are the source of much grief (albeit unintended) for their society parents). I don't wish to give the storylines, scandals and surprises away. Suffice it to say that as the series progress, there are lovers, marriages, births and deaths (not to mention the arrival of a beautiful young niece) which impact on the relationships and alter the composition of the group above stairs.\n\nDownstairs we are privy to the lives of the servants in the Bellamy household. First and foremost is the devout, inflexible and regimental head butler, Angus Hudson, the staff overlord. Then there is the curmudgeonly but good-hearted cook, Mrs. Bridges. Other memorable characters include the efficient but sheltered head house\/parlour maid, Rose Buck; the religious but simple footman, Alfred; his successor, the good-natured Edward, who has an eye for the female staff; the not-overly-bright scullery maid, Emily, and her successor and intellectual equal, Ruby; and Lady Margery's prim and snobbish lady's maid, Miss Roberts.  Of course, one simply cannot forget the sassy, vivacious new under house\/parlour maid, Sarah (Pauline Collins), who is a real dreamer and schemer and who, like a bad penny, turns up on the Bellamys' doorstep periodically during the first two series, or the new capable-but-just-as-conniving chauffeur, Thomas (Collins' real-life husband, John Alderton), who is nobody's fool!  Like the family upstairs, the downstairs \"family\" too has its share of comings and goings, what with lovers, marriages, deaths, hirings, and firings.\n\nThis boxed set includes the 1979 spin-off series entitled Thomas and Sarah (thirteen 50-minute episodes), which chronicles the adventures and misadventures of those two memorable miscreants after they leave the Bellamy's employ.  Unlike Upstairs Downstairs, which is fairly high drama infused with a spattering comic relief here and there, Thomas and Sarah is very much a comedy-drama.  With Sarah's penchant for foreign accents and tale-telling and the conniving and entrepreneurial spirit that both characters embody, the stage is set for some thoroughly enjoyable vignettes. Most of the episodes involve the couple trying their hands (and luck) at something new--like running a match-making agency, working in a boys' school, working as magicians, and so on.  For all their efforts, however, they always seem to find themselves skint--and thus the need for another enterprise (and hence another enjoyable episode!).  The only thing less than satisfactory is the \"conclusion\" of the final episode, which left me wondering whether or not a second series was at least anticipated.  But that's is a minor quibble, for this is a series to be watched for the sheer enjoyment of the journey.\n\nOne final dvd bonus is the enjoyable and informative 50-minute 25th Anniversary Special,  which was produced around 1998 and includes remembrances by many of the surviving actors (including James, Elizabeth, Rose, Edward, Daisy, and Ruby).\n\nIn conclusion, Upstairs Downstairs is quite simply an outstanding dramatic series.  It is compelling, captivating, and often thought-provoking; and if you enjoy a dramatic series with lots of \"goings on,\" scandal, and so forth, you'll enjoy it all the more!  The inclusion of Thomas and Sarah is a delightful, light-hearted, entertaining bonus, and I highly, HIGHLY recommend this boxed set to all fans of the very best in British period drama.","summary":"One of the Best British Period Dramas of All Time!","unixReviewTime":1155686400,"vote":105.0,"image":null}

Suffice it to say that as the series progress, there are lovers, marriages, births and deaths (not to mention the arrival of a beautiful young niece) which impact on the relationships and alter the composition of the group above stairs.\n\nDownstairs we are privy to the lives of the servants in the Bellamy household. First and foremost is the devout, inflexible and regimental head butler, Angus Hudson, the staff overlord. Then there is the curmudgeonly but good-hearted cook, Mrs. Bridges. Other memorable characters include the efficient but sheltered head house\/parlour maid, Rose Buck; the religious but simple footman, Alfred; his successor, the good-natured Edward, who has something of an eye for the female staff; the not-overly-bright scullery maid, Emily, and her successor and intellectual equal, Ruby; and Lady Margery's prim and snobbish lady's maid, Miss Roberts.  Of course, one simply cannot forget the sassy, vivacious new under house\/parlour maid, Sarah (Pauline Collins), who is a real dreamer and schemer, or the new chauffeur, Thomas (John Alderton--Collins' real-life husband), who is nobody's fool!  Like the family upstairs, the downstairs \"family\" too has its share of comings and goings, what with lovers, marriages, deaths, hirings, and firings.\n\nThe boxed set contains all five series (with a total of 68 episodes).  Series one and two cover the Edwardian period from 1903 to King Edward's death in 1910. There is little change in the household throughout these two series, and although the entire series is spectacular, these first two sets are my favourite. Series three covers the period from 1912 to the start of WWI. Series four covers the war (1914-1918), and its depiction of the realities of war from the human standpoint is unsurpassed, making series four a very, very strong series indeed. Series five covers the twenties.\n\nIn conclusion, this is quite simply an outstanding dramatic series. I would, in fact, go so far as to say that it is required viewing for anyone who enjoys first-rate period drama. But its appeal is broad enough to be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys compelling, captivating, and often thought-provoking drama; and if you enjoy a dramatic series with lots of \"goings on,\" scandal, and so forth, you'll enjoy it all the more! It's a large set, but it's well worth taking a chance on.  I simply cannot imagine anyone not enjoying it.  Those who've enjoyed Upstairs Downstairs will surely want to check out The Duchess of Duke Street (both of which were produced by John Hawkesworth).","summary":"An Outstanding British Period Drama!","unixReviewTime":1155427200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Hornaday","reviewText":"I rejoice in the technological development of DVDs which provides the perfect format for the celebrated release, in one complete box set, of one of the finest series that has ever graced, or will ever grace, TV!\n\nThis British series is truly in a \"class\" by itself. It's characters are unforgettable, the acting inspired and the backdrop evocative - Edwardian England from 1904 into the 1930s.\n\nThe story evolves around the aristocractic Bellamy family \"Upstairs\" at 165 Eaton Place, London, and their servants \"Downstairs,\" but it is not a soap opera. It is as genuine, real and honest as any period production, or for that matter, any production, that I have ever seen.\n\nThe characters grapple with the same struggles that we continue to confront in mordern-day America: love, loss, coming of age, morality, prejudice, death, economics, social responsibility, unwed mothers, change, freedom and the search for life's ultimate meaning - concluding with the horrendous effects of a World War and its devastating aftermath.\n\nThe \"master\" of the house, Sir Richard Bellamy, played with genuine heart by David Langton, is in Parliament thanks to the enormous political influence of the family of his well-bred wife, Lady Marjorie Southwold Bellamy, played with aplumb and surprising depth by Rachel Gurney.\n\nWe come to know the couple and their problems, as we witness a doomed love affair by Marjorie with an artist that she forsakes to save her mariage and which underscores the power of duty in English society. Richard learns of the affair but doesn't address it directly with his wife, whom he resolutely adores, but instead stands by her as she grieves for the one true love she has chosen to give up. Marjorie's life is cut short (the actress left the show after two seasons) after a fateful voyage on the Titanic.\n\nThe Bellamy's house parlormaid Rose Buck is portrayed by Jean Marsh, who created the show and starred throughout the series. Rose is compassionate, tough and as real a \"person\" as if she had actually been alive.\n\nOther tremendous characters of this brilliant ensamble cast include the butler, Angus Hudson, portrayed by the late, great Gordon Jackson, the Bellamy's cook, Mrs. Kate Bridges, played by the late Angela Baddeley, and the Bellamy's son, James Bellamy, played by the gifted Simon Williams.\n\nIt is Hudson who not only keeps the house running smoothly, but is also the keeper of English social propriety and tradition, objecting to modernization and the merging of social classes. Hudson desperately tries to hold onto the society he knew and loved, but international events conspire to change the very fibre of British culture.\n\nBut, it is through the character of James Bellamy that these historical events are played out. Initially, a \"useless\" member of the young nobility, James was restless and lived primarily for himself and leisure pursuits. Uncontrollably, he is swept up in the tide that became World War I and changed England, as well as the World, forever.\n\nJames becomes an officer and sees combat and the horrors of war. James eventually returns to Eaton Place after the war ends, but is unable to cope with his \"new\" life or reclaim his \"old\" one, so he ends it by his own hand in the former safety of the family estate.\n\nAs the series ends, the Edwardian age of English innocence and \"fun\" has also truly suffered a fatally self-inflicted wound. So, it is fitting that after James' suicide it is the nostalgic Hudson who, with a tear in his eye, closes the house -- and thereby symbolically, the era -- forever.\n\nThese are only a few of the characters and events that become real in the series, which ran through 68 riviting episodes.\n\nThis unflinching look at history as well as a truly timeless, engaging family saga is not to be missed. The series was originally broadcast on PBS's Masterpiece Theatre, and was introduced each week by the late popular historian, Allistair Cooke.","summary":"A Breathtaking Saga of True Life Returns!!!","unixReviewTime":1115251200,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

When this DVD set arrived, I hoped that at least it could recreate the Edwardian world for me, as it did 30+ years ago.  I was wrong.  It is so much better than I remember.  With the perspective and experience of thirty years coloring the viewing, the foibles and triumphs of the two families upstairs and down are so much more compelling now.  With the underlying theme that the house must run smoothly no matter what is going on in the inside or outside world, the dependence of the two families on each other is beautifully portrayed.  The period details, down to the china patterns and the paint colors are exquisite, and the characterizations the actors bring to their parts, made possible by the very fine writing, superb.\n\n  From the first episode when Lady Marjorie hires Sarah \"On Trial\" and gently but firmly establishes Sarah's position in the household, through the elegance and grandeur of the Edwardian era, \"There's no one to touch you, Mrs. Bridges, when it comes to lamb,\" the exigencies of WWI, when poor shell-shocked Edward the footman is cared for by Lord Bellamy; to the bittersweet end, when Lord Bellamy's diatribe when James loses Rose's inheritance in the stock market crash of 1929, causes a tragedy; the delicate balance between upstairs and down is fascinating and amazing to watch.  The pride the servants take in the successes of the upstairs family, which their support makes possible, and the avuncular care with which the Bellamys \"look after\" the servants (\"I hate to see servants humiliated,\" says Georgina, when unexpectedly confronted with Frederick in an embarassing situation) make this series particularly fascinating to Americans, for whom this way of life has never existed.\n\n  Despite bombs falling, housemaids giving birth in the attic, party guests committing suicide outside the nursery, various forms of heartbreak occuring both upstairs and down, it's reassuring to know that at 165 Eaton Place, dinner will always be served by an impeccably clad butler on impeccably polished silver, and that tea in the servant's hall will always be accompanied by one of Mrs. Bridges' delicious cakes (when she's not in a snit about being made to go to a lecture on wartime cookery).\n\n  No, the quality of the DVDs is not the best, but given a choice between owning it, with all its glitches and jumps--and not having it available at all--I'll take it. There are no problems distracting enough to make it unwatchable. This remarkable series has stood the test of time and truly shines.  The fine writing, splendid acting and authentic sets involve the viewer in the stories to the extent that the minor jumps and glitches are unimportant.  My only complaint is that Alistair Cooke's wonderful introductions are not included.","summary":"Television's Finest Hours","unixReviewTime":1106352000,"vote":15.0,"image":null}

The quality of the color footage varies at times but it certainly gives you the feeling that you were there much more than if you were to watch the same footage shot only in black and white.  The quality of the sound is excellent. Thank goodness for the History Channel from which this program comes!\n\nThe first of the two DVDs contains color films of events beginning at about the time of The Spanish Civil War and the coronation of a new King (George) in Great Britain. We witness footage of English statesmen actually visiting amicably with Hitler; Hitler sure had them fooled! There is interesting footage of great historical value concerning the German invasions of countries like Poland and The Soviet Union; and we also see the horrifying color footage of the fires in London during the German bombing of the city.\n\nThe first DVD also includes footage of the fight in the Pacific; we see our men fighting to capture islands in the Pacific that could be sued as bases for important military maneuvers including the Enola Gay flight that would drop \"the bomb\" on Japan.\n\nIn addition, there is color footage of the brutal Wausau ghetto where Jews were housed like cattle and children were left as orphans on the streets to die. The brutal treatment of the Jews and other Nazi atrocities are made very clear throughout the course of this two DVD set.\n\nThe second DVD gives us footage of the last year and one-half of the war. We see D Day, the rescue of France, other countries, and the people in concentration camps from brutal German occupation and the gradual erosion of Hitler's German military machine. The footage continues to show us a great deal of bombing, damage from bombing and carnage. It's truly fascinating to watch World War II in color.\n\nThe DVDs have some extras on the second of the two DVDs. What we get is mostly more color footage that was not used for the actual program of World War II in color. There is footage of Hitler and the elite guards at his country estate and we get great footage of Americans fighting their best. We see more footage of fires raging through destroyed cities--and more. This is excellent bonus footage and it lasts about twenty minutes.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this two DVD package for history buffs, military buffs and veterans of World War II.

It is one of the more well-done documentaries that I have seen and does an excellent job of laying out the battle tactics, territory, major personages and instruments of Roman warfare up until about the time of the Antonine rulers.\nWhat makes this documentary particularly special is its usage of authentic and re-created signs of Roman hegemony.  For example, we have the opportunity to view a  nearly full-scale mock up of a Roman fort in a forest located in Germany.  We also see the palisades where Vercingetorix made his last stand in what is modern day France.\nOn top of this, we are invited to archeological excavations in & around Hadrian's Wall which was built to demark the line between Great Britain and Scotland (Caledonia).  The scholars there disinter the coinage of Rome thru the ages, as well as ancient letters of soldiers, medical instruments and much more.  Fascinating stuff!\nFor a grand overview of the expanse of the Roman empire, this would be a terrific video-set to buy.  However, precious little is shown or alluded to Rome itself.  For those who are only interested in the history & politics inside Rome, other documentaries would be much more appropriate.  If, on the other hand, you want to know more about the Legions on the frontiers of Roman territories, the present videos would be a superb choice.","summary":"Going to war with the Romans","unixReviewTime":1043539200,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

After many years and a format transfer, my copy was in pretty poor shape.  Happy to have a DVD copy to enjoy (as I did last night).\n\n\"The Crossing\" tells the story of General George Washington's preparations to attack the Hessian soldiers (in service to Britain) at Trenton on Christmas 1776.  The movie highlights the disagreements and personality conflicts between Washington and some of his key commanders, and the challenges of pulling off such a revolutionary attack.\n\nThe movie benefits from many quality actors and from its tight focus on the build-up to the crossing, the crossing, fight, and immediate aftermath.  I don't think I'd known until watching this that Washington's men retreated back across the river after the attack.\n\nMy only real quibble with the video quality is that you can tell where the commercial breaks were from the original TV production airing.  I would think that they could have edited the video together a little bit better so that those weren't as noticeable or else didn't exist at all on the DVD.  It wasn't so bad that I couldn't enjoy the movie, but it was noticeable at least a few times.\n\nI liked Jeff Daniels from his work in Ted Turner's Gettysburg\/Gods and Generals and like him here as well.  As with the two movies I've just mentioned, this one gives little bits of info on what happened to some of these historical figures after this battle.","summary":"Nice historical movie","unixReviewTime":1421712000,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

The moment, and the movie, focus on a low point in American fortunes during the Revolutionary War.  Washington's Continental Army had been driven in defeat from New Jersey by the British Army, and faced dissolving altogether as enlistments expired at the end of the year.  Washington daringly staked everything on a surprise counter-attack that caught the enemy sleeping off the holiday in Trenton in the early hours of 26 December.  Washington's high stakes gamble saved the Continental Army, and perhaps the young United States, from extinction.\n\nJeff Daniels is very credible as the stern and determined Washington.  The supporting cast is also quite good, especially Sebastian Roche as the tough-minded General John Glover from Massachusetts, now unfortunately largely forgotten in history, whose Marblehead fishermen rowed the Army across an ice-choked river.  The production values and the attention to detail should easily satisfy most viewers.  It would be hard not to be caught up in the drama of the situation.

While it is a serious, well-filmed story on General Washington's most challenging times during the war, with plenty of drama built into it, it is very much a factual masterpiece, more than adequately supported at the conclusion by a summary of the lives of the individuals who were most prominently featured in the story.  The film carefully built up enduring the dire situation at Valley Forge into culminating with Washington's famed \"Crossing of the Delaware,\" no mean logistics feat at the time, and the surprise taking of the British forces at Trenton\n\nPerhaps the most powerful aspect of the film is Jeff Daniels' portrayal of George Washington, during which he once again showed his versatile thespian abilities.  I cannot think of another contemporary actor who could have played the part more believably.  Be assured, the casting organization that selected the rest of the actors did a wonderful job.

Desertion was rampant. Arms, ammunition, and rations were scarce. Only a small number of the Revolutionaries had any military experience.\n\nEven worse, as was usual in warfare until the 20th century, epidemic diseases were the major cause of casualties, with so many men living together in the open under unsanitary conditions. As if this wasn't bad enough, it was winter, and most of Washington's demoralized troops had only days left to their enlistment contracts.\n\nWith the Revolution on the verge of collapse, General Washington needed a victory, ...immediately.\n\nAt this point in American History, ...America, OUR nation, was dangerously close to never HAVING a history. This was, quite possibly, the most critical moment in the story of America. The man who signifigantly changed our national destiny at this moment in time, was George Washington.\n\nSo how did General Washington save the Revolution from collapse? The story is portrayed most excellently in this movie!\n\nGeneral Washington received intelligence that a regiment of German Hessian mercenaries had made winter-quarters in Trenton, New Jersey. The troops from Hess were considered amongst the very best of professional soldiers in Europe. They had already inflicted severe defeats upon the Revolutionaries earlier that year. It was a long shot, with what limited resources he had under his command, ...but Washington realized that he just might have a chance at a much-needed victory, ...if all went as planned. Surely he did not expect his operation to result in one of the most one-sided victories in military history!\n\nWashington made his proposal to his subordinates. Most of them were vehemently opposed to the operation, given all the factors involved. The weather was abyssmal, intense cold and freezing rain. To get to Trenton, they had to cross the Delaware River, which was already full of large chunks of ice, and a limited quantity of boats.\n\nDespite the various obstacles, they adapted, improvised, and overcame.\n\nThey moved their ragged, starving, inexperienced army across the water, marching all night, cold and drenched to the bone! Many of these fellows didn't have shoes. It rained most of the way. The gun-powder was too wet to fire their rifles and muskets. Only the artillery had dry powder, ...which they used to great effect.\n\nThis factor makes the nature of this victory at Trenton even more amazing:\nThe Revolutionary army fixed bayonets, and rushed the town, KILLING the much more proficient enemy at CLOSE-QUARTERS! The completely surprised Hessian troops had just spent the previous night drunkenly carousing and feasting on Christmas Eve. Not one of them expected to be impaled by bayonets in the morning! Not one Revolutionary soldier was killed or injured in the attack on Trenton! Needless to say, ...this victory had the desired result on American morale.\n\nThe man who delivered this Christmas Present to America was OUR Founding Father, ...George Washington!\nHe succeeded because he was assisted by REAL MEN who were determined to accomplish this mission.\n\nThe real signifigance of this movie:\nThere have been several moments in the history of America, at home and abroad, where the nation faced seemingly overwhelming enemies, and abyssmally dire circumstances. This film portrays one of the first of such incidents. REAL AMERICANS take action. They lock and load, fix bayonets, ...and by the grace of God force a glorious victory from what was presumed to be an \"inevitable\" defeat. Be thankful that we had a REAL AMERICAN in command on Christmas Day of 1776!","summary":"The right man at the critical moment.","unixReviewTime":1380326400,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

This film - despite some revisionism - is an excellent portrayal of the crossing and the Battle of Trenton.  Jeff Daniels does a surprisingly good job of characterizing Washington's demeanor, patriotism and dedication to the \"Glorious Cause\", as most revolutionists of the time called our American Revolution. After all Daniels is not new to portraying historical military figures, having portrayed Joshua Chamberlain in \"Gettysburg\" and \"Gods and Generals\". In fact the acting by the entire cast is uniformly good throughout. Despite his dedication and patriotism, Washington had surprisingly little military experience before taking command and had to learn as the revolution evolved. Trenton was his first real battlefield success. Washington came very close to losing his army; and we came very close to losing the Revolution in 1776. It was mostly due to Washington's determination and daring that we were able to continue fighting instead of going down to an inglorious defeat. This movie does a good job of telling that story...it is an excellent film and an excellent history lesson.

In 'The Crossing' he takes on a even larger icon from the American past and pretty much knocks it out of the park. George Washington has always been one of my favorite historical characters, I think pretty highly of him. I think that he and his men were the glue that held the American Revolution together. Washington could have been a dictator but wasn't. His character and devotion to country are the stuff legends are made of.\n\n'The Crossing' finds Washington at a critical time when he is at low ebb after the humbling defeats around New York. The war effort is portrayed in a very unromantic life. This was a war that America lost more battles than it won. But Washington at Christmas 1776 had a ace up his sleeve and the rest as they say is history. Daniels dazzles as Washington and portrays him as a very human character and shows his great temper that Washington usually kept under wraps. His dry humor is also a nice touch. I also like the bringing to life of the nearly forgotten John Glover ,by Sebastian Roch, and the true bravery of his men and what they sacrificed for the cause without their efforts little would have been possible. Roger Rees also does a nice job as Washington's friend Hugh Mercer. Mercer was one of the ancestors of George S. Patton of World War II fame, for a little trivia.\n\nThe film captures the cold of winter well and is a DVD to watch in December-January when the leaves have fallen off the trees and you have a warm crackling fire inside. This film captures that tough winter well and the spirit of the men who remained and the great leader who led them in one great roll of the dice. I wish more films were made about our Revolution.\n\nThe DVD has good picture and sound plus an interesting little 'making of' the film as an extra.\n\nHighly recommended!","summary":"Very Good Film on Washington and critical time in the American Revolution","unixReviewTime":1249776000,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

Like most American schoolchildren, my familiarity with the crossing of the Delaware at Trenton was limited to the famous painting of that event which shows General Washington perched imperiously in the prow of a boat while being rowed through icy waters in the dead of night.  The reality was decidedly less cinematic; unfortunately, so is this made-for-television treatment.  Admittedly, I was spoiled by the superior production values of \"John Adams\" beside which this production pales.  In its favor, it does present a grittier version of life in the Continental Army than we are accustomed to seeing and does much to humanize the deified personage of its Supreme Commander.  But the production was hobbled by obvious budget constraints and prosaic camera work that make it look very like the TV project it was.  This decisive battle that turned the Revolution in the colonialists' favor is portrayed as little more than a skirmish between Washington's ragtag band of volunteers and a bunch of unsuspecting drunks.  Maybe in truth that's all it was, but the amateur look of this production does nothing to elevate the action into something a little more noble.  It appears that the fate of the Revolution hinged on little more than a brawl.  But it was a brawl the fledging nation desperately needed to win, and Washington is revealed as a crafty stratetician who was willing to risk all on a breathtaking gamble all others dimissed as insane.  The isolation of Washington's command is portrayed with numerous references to the utter lack of support for Washington from the very body that had authorized him to carry out this war.  Citizens of the Republic in the present day may take comfort (or not) in the knowledge that from its very earliest incarnation, the Congress honed its reputation as a bunch of blow-hard self-promoters who existed to endlessly debate but not to act.  Also shown is the in-fighting among Washington's generals, some of whom resented his authority and in some cases, plotted actively to undermine it.  As Washington, Jeff Daniels successfully gives the 'statue' flesh and bone.  He has a wonderful physicality for the role and looks every part the vigorous and devotion-inspiring leader in his prime.  More problematic is his delivery, which sounds too much of the contemporary Midwest (Daniels is a Michigan native) and not much at all like the 'gentleman from Virginia.'  In general, I am not in favor of American actors larding up their dialogue with distracting accents, but though Daniels looks great, he does not sound convincing as a Tidewater aristocrat.  In contrast to the mostly British supporting cast with their more elegant diction, Daniels is rough-hewn and out of his element.  He also delivers his lines very s-l-o-w-ly; one hardly thinks Washington, in the heat of battle for his life and the Republic would have been so laconic. The teleplay by Howard Fast (based on his novel of the same name) displays a tin ear for authentically colonial-sounding dialogue, with many 20th century anarchronisms creeping in, and it presents the greatest obstacle for the actors.  Some worthwhile moments of content, but stylistically this could have done better by its subject.","summary":"An Epic Battle Not So Epic","unixReviewTime":1216252800,"vote":11.0,"image":null}

Jeff Daniels gives a wonderful performance as Washington and lifts the movie above the usual mediocrity of most made-for-TV-movies. All too often, actors are cast to play historic characters they just do not fit. In this case, not only does Daniels bear a passable resemblance to Washington, but he conveys the concern, insecurity, impatience, and determination the general admitted to feeling in his letters and correspondence.\n\nI enjoy reading about history, particularly the colonial\/Revolutionary War period, and am generally wary of historical movies due to their tendency to fudge on facts. While I do not claim to be a historian, I found The Crossing to be pretty accurate. I do wish they had brought in more soldiers since the battle scene appeared somewhat skimpy in that regard.\n\nThe sets and costumes fit comfortably with the time setting, as does the language and mannerisms. The picture is clear and clean, not distorted by fading colors or other problems. While it was made for TV, I did not find the breaks to be annoyingly obvious as with some. The DVD includes extras, including an interesting account of the movie being made, as well as interviews. One part shows how stunt men made the battle scenes appear real- something younger viewers might enjoy.\n\nThere is neither objectionable language in the movie, nor any sexual themes. The battle is not particularly bloody or violent, but would probably be PG if rated. It would make a nice addition to a homeschool history curriculum as well as the family video library. I will certainly be watching this movie again.","summary":"Surprisingly well done","unixReviewTime":1209168000,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

The Wikipedia entry for the movie has most of them. And like most movies dealing with any war, there are not enough men on the screen to portray the actual number of soldiers involved. Washington had more than 2000 troops when he went into Trenton, up against about the same number of Hessians. Of course, without computer-generated graphics, there's no way a made-for-television movie can portray that.\n\nI have to question the casting of Jeff Daniels as Washington. I know Washington was a flesh and blood person, but somehow Daniels (or perhaps the script he had to work with) does not communicate the gravitas that must have personified Washington. This was a man chosen practically unanimously by the Continental Congress to lead the army. Daniels does not come across as that sort of person.\n\nAlthough it is known that Washington had a temper, especially in extremis, most of the time Daniels' Washington comes across as merely petulant or even bitchy.\n\nThe dialogue between most of the characters seemed at times to be pretty anachronistic. American screenwriters should take a lesson from their British counterparts (Andrew Davies, for example) on how to write 18th Century dialogue that sounds authentic but not stilted or phoney.\n\nFinally, THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. We watched it with our 7 and 9 year olds because they're studying the Revolution in school. We were dismayed by the bad language, sexual references and the over-the-top bloodletting. Why did the director think it a good idea to show closeups of bayoneting and swords going all the way through people? Showing it is one thing -- but closeups? C'mon!

Compare this movie to say something like Mel Gibson's PATRIOT and you have the difference between quality and trash!  The movie conveys the feeling and desperation of Washy's army on its last legs before striking back at Trenton.  Jeff Daniels does a spirted but probably false impression of Washy.  In reality the man was much more stiff and proper than is shown here.  Washy would never use such language in front of the common soldiers!  He rarely lost his temper as well, otherwise the famous tongue lashing of Charles Lee at Monmouth two years later would never have created such a sensation as it did.  Daniels makes Washy much more likeable to the modern audience, but is an flawed portrayal.\n\nThe production value of this film is first-rate.  Obviously period re-enactors were used and their dedication to the hobby shows in the correct formations, drills, etc.  The brief skirmish at the beginning with the British probably did not happen so close to the Delaware like that.  Also, the uniforms for the British appear off somehow.  They look like an earlier period, not the 1770s.  Still, it works.  The Hessians are well portrayed, although it would have provided variety if some Musketeer's with their tri-corn hats were shown.  Not all of Rall's men were Grenadiers and Fusiliers!\n\nAmerican losses were actually 2 dead from the march, and 4 wounded from the fight, including Hamilton and Monroe, the latter a future US President!  I don't know why the movie did not convey this.  The effects of Knox's artillery seems also much exaggerated.  Solid shot and cannister was used, not explosive shells as shown here.  Most films on this period fail to show artillery accurately in that regard.  Still, the acting and mood of the film are right on the mark which makes it easily the best Rev War production out there. Too bad it did not go further to show Washy's next great triumph at Princeton where a small British detachment gave him a much harder run for his money.  Still, what we have here is a nice concise work that comes close to converying the actual history of the event.  This is more than most Hollywood productions do these days.  Let's hope future movie producers draw upon this movie for inspiration rather than the PATRIOT and others like it.","summary":"One of the Best Rev War Pics Out There!","unixReviewTime":1163635200,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

The film brings to the screen George Washington's first victory during the American Revolution: The Battle of Trenton.\n\nIt is December 1776 and the Continentals have yet to score a victory against the British.  Chased by government forces, the rebels find themselves exhausted on the banks of the Delaware river with General George Washington remaining Commander-in-Chief, but of the now remnants of what used to be the Continental Army (once numbering 20,000, now at 2,000 and dwindling).  Subsequently, Washington is faced with yet another difficult choice: does he camp for the winter and hope that he will still have his rank and an army spring come, or does he surprise-attack the city of Trenton, which is in the hands of 1200 crack German troops from Hessen?\n\nThe Crossing provides valuable insight into a very important period of American (and British) History. Specifically:\n\nWe get a taste (though a very light one) of the different attitudes and mentality of English North American colonists during the war e.g. when the foundry's owner refused to let the Continentals use his boats (before they were in turn confiscated).\n\nMoreover, we get to see or hear about, the double-crossing generals such as General Lee that allowed himself to be caught... and yet not so much about the merchants, farmers, and politicians that supported whichever side the wind happened to be blowing in, always in search of profit and personal gain, which another film, Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor, portrays so well.\n\nThe clash between the Loyalist American English and the Continental American English is not really shown, just the one between the Continentals and the British along with their Hessen allies\/mercenaries, which is nonetheless fascinating and very well presented throughout the film; but then so is the clash within the Continental side (the undermining, the personality clashes-Washington vs Gates and Lee etc, favoritism-the contingency plan in having Sullivan arrest Lee), as well as the problems between Congress and the Army (there are the subtlest of hints for the latter\/Ral's sword sent to Congress).\n\nThere is also the brave admission (by G. Washington) that the Continentals lack public support (enlistment being at a minimum, while trying to keep their minutemen from deserting), and the important role that Washington played throughout the Revolution in keeping the Continentals \"alive,\" long enough for the French (1778), Spaniards (1779), and Dutch (1780) to enter the war against Great Britain, and win the war.\n\nTherefore, the movie successfully sheds light on aspects of American History that some would rather keep hidden \"under the carpet.\"\n\nAs a result, The Crossing, is a daring movie, which shatters more than a few misconceptions, deliberate and not, surrounding attitudes towards the War of Independence, and provides for historical truths, which had been suppressed for long years in the name of \"patriotism.\"\n\nThe only major setback is in relation to Jeff Daniels who is not that great in his role; Kelsey Grammer was a much better Washington in Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor.\n\nAs for the end where it states that: \"The records show that a total of 16,992 Hessians were brought to America to fight the colonists.\"  That should be \"...to fight the rebel colonists,\" not forgetting the Loyalists and the Neutrals made up approximately 1\/3 each, of the total colonist populace.\n\nIn short, The Crossing is a movie definitely worth watching, and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection.\n\nStrongly recommended, especially for History buffs, along with Revolution starring Al Pacino, and Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor, starring Aidan Quinn and Kelsey Grammer. 4.5 Stars","summary":"\"In the end, sir, we all kill for profit\"","unixReviewTime":1153353600,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

They should see, in the dramatic way that a video makes possible , the sacrifices that these earlier people made to give us a free country.\nI have often marvelled at the patience and tenacity of Washington through those 7 long years of war.  This film emphasizes his tenacity and just plain \"toughness.\"  It also gives us a picture of those few common soldiers who stayed with him through bitter defeat and privation while the majority deserted or otherwise disappeared.  These few made the great difference.  And among these few were fewer still the fishermen from Marblehead who saved the Army in New York making possible the escape march to Valley Forge.  This same close-knit group of men made the difference again at The Crossing.  They knew how to handle boats actually making the crossing possible.\nAs you watch the film listen especially carefully to the conversations between General Washington (Jeff Daniels) and Col. John Glover (Sebastian Roche).  Col. Glover is the feisty, outspoken officer who often disagrees but who knows how to take orders.  He commanded the Marblehead fishermen without whom Valley Forge and the Crossing would never have taken place.\nIf you are interested get Howard Fast's \"The Unvanguished.\"  This book tells the story of the Marblehead fisherman in New York in detail.  Fast wrote The Crossing including this film script. With Fast's earlier New York battle background you will understand how the Army got into such a desperate situation and Washington's relationship and conversations with Glover in this movie will make all the more sense.  .\nThe acting is good to very good.  The script is very good.  The story moves along well.  The settings are realistic and well done.  This is no sacrifice. It is real entertainment.  But it could inspire you to a little sacrifice for your country should the need arises.","summary":"America's history of tenacity and unselfishness","unixReviewTime":1080345600,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

It was adapted from a novel by Howard Fast and I assume it is historically accurate.  It's about a defining moment in American history - that of George Washington crossing the Delaware River and attacking the well-trained German soldiers hired by the British, at Trenton, New Jersey.\nI recently visited a friend who lives in that area and walked across the bridge where George Washington made this historic crossing.  Of course there was no bridge back in 1776 on that cold December day -- just the dark and the cold and an ice-filled river.  The Continentals, which was what the Americans were called then, were losing the war. They had not won a battle since they declared independence six months before on July 4.  The troops were weary and starving.  It looked like the American Revolution was lost.\nBut Washington took a huge risk, and in his own quiet and determined way, made a decision that changed the course of history.  The scenes of the actual crossing were done in fog and shadow, as the boats moved towards the opposite shore.  But there were no scenes that looked like the famous painting with Washington standing in the front of the boat.  In this film, Washington was sitting throughout. Naturally, this made me re-think my own historical perceptions.\nJeff Daniels is cast as Washington, and I found myself very critical of his performance.  He seemed aloof and wooden and, even though there was constant danger, he never lost his cool, calm leadership abilities.  I understand, though, that this is exactly the kind of person that George Washington was. If this is true, then he did portray him well.\nBasically, though, even though there was some conflict between the various generals as well as a bit of bawdy language and some violent scenes of swordplay, the film never rose above that of a history lesson, one shown in classrooms or while visiting museums. I tend to like my drama more complex though, and for that reason this film, while well done, has to be viewed for what it is.  I therefore give it a modest recommendation.  It's certainly worthwhile seeing.","summary":"Well-done history lesson","unixReviewTime":1032566400,"vote":20.0,"image":null}

Although it doesn't seem to have enjoyed a great budget and although it has just a hint of an educational taste to it, the Crossing seems far more historically relevant than films like Patriot or Pacino's Revolution.  Daniels displays incredible posture especially while riding a horse and as a passenger in a boat through all hours of the night and thus quietly impresses upon us the dignity of America's first and fearless leader.","summary":"Beautiful portrayal of Washington","unixReviewTime":1019088000,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

Schweitzer","reviewText":"This is a wonderfully done made-for-cable movie about George Washington and his famous victory at the Battle of Trenton in the winter of 1776.  Starring Jeff Daniels as General Washington, this film brings an important episode in American history vividly to life.  We see the broken remnants of the Continental army as it races to avoid capture following their defeats in New York.  The British, close on the heels of the retreating rebels, have written the Americans off as being on the verge of total surrender. Washington, tired and beaten, realizes that he must make one last attempt to achieve victory or all hope for the revolution will be lost.  Against the judgement of his officers, Washington prepares to launch a desperate offensive against a large force of Hessian troops occupying the town of Trenton, just across the Delaware River in New Jersey. The future of the new United States hangs in the balance as the rag-tag army bets all or nothing on this dangerous gamble.  Well written and with money well-spent, The Crossing is a dramatic telling of this important moment in American history, and one that I would recommend to teachers, students, and history enthusiasts alike.","summary":"Washington and the Battle of Trenton","unixReviewTime":1015718400,"vote":139.0,"image":null}

Based on my somewhat limited reading (Richard Kethchum's \"The Winter Soldiers\"), this movie delivers reasonably well. More so, the most truly important aspect of history movies, in my opinion, is the context and how well this given period is presented...in essence, how deeply does the viewer feel involved? This is the issue that makes this movie stand out. Watching this, I felt all the emotions that Washington appeared to go through (desperation, frustration, exhileration upon smashing the Hessians at Trenton...) and just  marveled at the \"period\" depiction. I really felt that this was what it was like in 1776 Pennsylvania and New Jersey (volunteers with no uniforms or warm clothes...some even without shoes in the dead of winter...). Washington's character was well played by Jeff Daniels as he portrayed the important leadership qualities that made him a legend and founding father. Daniels \"playing\" Washington also managed to come across as somewhat flawed (i.e. \"human\"...) while giving a semblance of Washington's major desperation. On the negative side, I'm not so sure that Colonel Glover's role was historically accurate, although it was also well acted. In summary, an excellent movie and one that should be viewed by anyone interested in the Revolution.

Lynde","reviewText":"I often show \"The Crossing\" to my political science classes and invariably they are enthralled.  It is an intriguing, almost shocking film.  The most striking surprise is that Jeff Daniels pulls off a portrayal of the great Washington with humanism, determinism, unparalleled leadership, mixed with a little testiness and bawdiness - in sum, a man with flaws who took his life and his mission seriously, while winning the loyalty of his rag tag troops.\nWashington was somewhat wooden, which Daniels again plays well, because he took every aspect of his life with dead seriousness and a clear vision of the nation he almost single-handedly created.  Present at the creation of the new nation, commander in chief, he rallied his men at the battle of Trenton in December 1776, the subject of this film, avenging his early loss of New York City.\nThe inaccuracies in the film are of little consequence since its essence is Washington.  His audacious crossing of the treacherous Delaware on Christmas eve in the depth of night, completely surprising battle-hardened, but hung-over Hessians, helped turned the tide of the war at a time when America's victory teetered on disaster.  Daniels creates a man, not a myth, giving him just the right amount of stiffness and caring for his men, and a determination that would win the very long war.\nJames Kidnie as the Hessian Colonel Rall is the perfect foil to Washington.  As the attack rages, he meticulously dresses himself and then panics at the American onslaught, hardly believing his eyes.  Director Harmon's pacing is plodding at times, but the crossing itself is full of suspense, the battle scenes more than passably exciting.  The cinematography and supporting cast are adequate. But the star of this film is Daniels. In sum, a fine A&E production well worth seeing.","summary":"Hats Off to Jeff Daniels","unixReviewTime":1001462400,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

What struck me was not the audacity of Washington attacking in the dead of winter, but the cooperation of his subordinates that was need to even make this action remotely possible.  This is an ensemble performance that centers around Washington but shows the synergistec effect that was needed to make the attack work.\n\nJeff Daniels is excellent as Washington pulling his dispirited troops together for a decisive action.  Washington was taking a great risk, maybe the biggest of his career; by making a winter attack.  Armies of this time, rarely, if ever, fought in the winter and Washington was going against convention by doing so.  He was also conducting an amphibious operation which is one of the hardest operations to perform in warfare.  Here the cooperation of others was critical.  If the men under Colonel John Glover were unable\/unwilling to give their all, Washington might just as well have stayed in camp.  No boats, no action fairly well sums it up.  Washington's troops could have muddled through and affected a crossing, but the element of surprise, I am sure would have been lost and no surprise meant a harder and more doubtful battle.  Glover is the true unsung hero of the battle and it is good to see him recognized as such.\n\nThis film abounds in small points.  The depiction of the Pennsylvania German troops in Washington's command is well done. The state of mind of Washington's troops, ofter overlooked, is shown in great detail.  The use of period sites also was a big plus in the making of this film.\n\nIn all, I found this one of the best films about Washington's attack on Trenton and one that gives a new impression of the compexity in executing this battle.

While President Clinton did offer a near-apology for our decades of funding and organizing Guatemala's dirty war that killed 200,000 people, our corporatocracy continues to exploit the region and to wage economic warfare via NAFTA, CAFTA and the World Bank.\n\n\"Men With Guns\" beautifully shows all who care the sort of brutal madness that has been taking place in Central America.  I've shared this film with Guatemalan immigrants I know, and they confirm the suffering they endured at the hands of our proxy forces.  These US taxpayer funded troops wiped out Guatemalan villages in the same way the Nazis wiped out Russian villages.  It's such a disgrace that it happened, and that so few Americans know about it.

He sets out to find his former students on the road to places he's never been. The shift in his life is caused by the death of his wife. He sets out in spite of his family not wanting him to leave. The aging doctor first encounters one his former students, now a drug dealer, using the same drugs he taught him to cure others, he is now using them for ill purposes. His journey has only begun and he finds many more dissapointments along the way. This is a beautiful film that is allegorical, historical, contemporary  and packed with messages for the viewer to interpret. In his quest to find his students he finds his country to be quite different from the view he had of it prior to his leaving the city. He encounters missing people  and tales of abductions from men with guns. The villagers call them white men with guns but are quick to say that the Indios are also now white men. Although the story takes place in an unnamed country, the parallels to Guatemala are clear. Having witnessed a corpse on the roadside while travelling in a bus (everyone gawked with little concern, as though it were a common sight) in Guatemala and seeing the treatment first hand of the military I am pretty sure this is where it is. However, this is unimportant as these occurences of hit squads and paramilitary goons, in cahoots with the military, are a frequent sight in many Latin American countries. Anyway, Dr. Fuentes picks up several people along the way to expand the tale. He picks up a \"liberation priest\" who abandons his collar and those who believed in him, a former military thug turned thief, an indigenous young woman who doesn't speak since she was raped by soldiers and a street-savy kid who is an orphan and Dr. Fuentes's guide. All represent the society Dr. Fuentes is unaware of and  as they tell their sordid stories, amidst flashbacks  and surreal dreams, a country whose people live in brutal chaos is revealed . This is a powerful movie, one to be seen more than once in order to fully enjoy. Although the story evolves around Dr. Fuentes and his crew,  there are several encounters with a funny couple who are \"informed\" tourists with bad Spanish accents  and worse pronunciation.

What, exactly is going on politically in South America?  Where does individual responsibility lie? What does helping people really mean?  What kind of legacy is it possible to leave?  The setting of this movie is an unnamed country in South America. The writer\/director, John Sayles, did this on purpose.  This is to show that the kind of thing depicted in the movie could happen anywhere.  However, it was shot in Mexico, in Spanish, with English subtitles.\nThe movie starts Federico Luppi as Dr. Humberto Fuentes, a wealthy doctor who is approaching retirement and has never paid close attention to the realities of his country.  His greatest achievement, the \"legacy\" he is leaving, is his participation in an international health program in which he trained young doctors to work in the poorest of villages.\nI watched this movie with horror and then, finally, resignation, as Dr. Fuentes travels in the mountains and makes startling discoveries.  I made a few startling discoveries myself -- the abject poverty of the people, the disregard for human life, the acceptance by the people of this as a way of life.  He finds that the people have no food.  He finds that both the army and the guerillas are equally brutal.  The movie takes us all on a journey with Dr. Fuentes.  Along the way we meet a homeless child, a priest who lives with his own private demons, and a deserter from the army with a history of participating in the carnage.  The movie goes deeper and deeper into the despair and devastation.\nThis is not a comfortable video to watch as it brings the viewer not only into the realities of the political systems in South America, but to the basic question of individual responsibility.

Sweeney","reviewText":"What we'd all like to see...the president of the US of A going mano a mano with terrorists.\n\nWhen Air Force One is infiltrated and overtaken by terrorists, the persident is hustleld into his escape pod and sent on his way...or so everyone thinks. Instead, he gets out and the pod flies empty while the commander-in-chief uses the skills that won him the Medal of Honor to outwit those holding his staff and family hostage.\n\nIt's best not to think too strongly about the feasibility of the plot or the action but simply sit back and enjoy the violence, action, and heroics.  There's plenty of violence of both the good and bad kind as most of the  Secret Service is picked off one by one, some of the staff get killed and a couple throw themselves in front of bullets meant for the President.  There's a bit of quibbling going on as the people back in Washington argue over who's now in charge, some wanting to shoot the plane out of the sky, others wanting to wait and see before acting.\n\nWith an allstar cast, from Harrison Ford, Glenn Close as the Vice Prfesident who shows a little more levelheadedness than some of the other staff members, Xander Berkeley, Gary Coleman, Paul Guilfoyle, and William H. Macy, this is a well-acted, well-plotted movie which will leave the audience breathless. Fox TV called it a \"wild ride,\" and it's that in more ways than one, especially the plane-to-plane rescue scene. The special effects are great.\n\nThis DVD is owned by the reviewer and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.","summary":"Definitely a \"Wild Ride\"","unixReviewTime":1481500800,"vote":null,"image":null}

Lawhern","reviewText":"Air Force One (1997) is a relentlessly paced thriller that is still very pertinent to the dilemmas faced (or depending on one's point of view, not faced) by present American leadership in a hostile and ambivalent world.  Though the underlying scenario is a bit outdated (ala 1990s), the themes are still engaging.  Harrison Ford turns in a nuanced and very skilled performance.  He is backed by several other strong actors, including a rather young Glenn Close acting as Vice President.  Liesel Matthews is remarkable as a 12 year old \"first daughter\" and Wendy Crewson is believable as First Lady.\n\nPlotting of the movie isn't perfect.  There are a few loose ends, but I won't spoil viewers' experience by discussing them at length.  Suffice it to say, there are some rather implausible acts by peripheral characters.  But overall, the story holds up well.\n\nAs a footnote, I would also add that I cannot imagine any US Presidential candidate in the current group of right wing crazies, panderers and political hacks, taking the public stand that Harrison Ford does as the President in this story.

The first 747 was used as \"Air Force One\" in 1990. When this movie came out \"Air Force One\" had been a 747 for only 7 years. Now it has been 25 years since \"Air Force One\" has been a 747.  In 2023 the new Aircraft that will serve as Air Force One will be a 747-8.  When the last 747 was delivered it was based on a 747-200 at the time it was delivered the 747-400 was being delivered. The 747-8 has the same type rating as the 747-400 they both have no flight engineer. The new Aircraft being used for Air Force One may be modified to have a flight engineers position, because it will undoubtedly have many more systems than a regular 747-8.  It will essentially have a type rating unto itself and its twin(s).  That is, no 747-8 rated pilot would be qualified to fly Air Force One.  Piloting Air Force One is a prestigious job, although it is boring. There are Air Force pilots that don't want the job. Many former Air Force pilots won't work for the Air Lines for the same reason.  It's like being a Formula One Car driver and then getting a job driving a Trailways Bus.","summary":"This movie now seems dated, it is now 18 years old.

This one has easily one of the most ludicrous high concepts of any high concept action movie from the past 30 years.  When it played in theaters I hated it--and I'm a huge fan of action pictures, although not of star Harrison Ford.  At that time I would have given Air Force One a one star review.\n\nIn light of the fact that the screenplay was by Andrew W Marlowe, the creator of Castle I decided to give the movie another shot and I have a slightly different take on it now.  Given the cheeky tone of his television show, which takes nothing, least of all murder seriously, I'm inclined to think that the script for Air Force One was written as a tongue-in-cheek commentary on dumb Hollywood action pictures rather than an actual dumb Hollywood action picture.\n\nThe problem is that native German director Wolfgang Peterson (Das Boot, The Perfect Storm) while tremendously talented is not known for his sense of humor or light touch.  He has an uncommonly good eye for widescreen visuals and old-style you-can-clearly-see-everything-that's-happening approach to his action scenes but he directs Air Force One with way too much gravity, making whatever humor that manages to survive seem campy and unintentional.  It's hard to ultimately made the action set-pieces in Air Force One exciting given Wolfgang Peterson's approach since it's simply not possible to take any of them as seriously as he apparently does.\n\nI'm not suggesting that Air Force One should have been directed as a comedy but there's a lighter approach in the films of fellow countryman Roland Emmerich (Independence Day; 2012; White House Down) that would have been perfect here.  Emmerich knows how to direct ridiculous material in a way that allows it to be silly and fun but still exciting--he knows he's making silly pulp films and embraces the humor of the ridiculous cliffhangers while allowing the audience to laugh without guilt and still enjoy the action and suspense.\n\nFor a practical example of what I'm talking about assume you are in the mood for a disaster movie--would you rather watch Wolfgang Peterson's technically well-made and lavish but dull Poseidon or Roland Emmerick's deliriously ludicrous but exciting and funny 2012?  The choice is obvious for me--but I was also a big fan of Emmerich's White House Down which I couldn't even get any of my friends to even watch, so what do I know?","summary":"The director of Das Boot was a bad choice for such silly material","unixReviewTime":1437609600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Brown","reviewText":"This movie is of the kind that used to be known as a \"star vehicle\" back in Hollywood's Golden Age. Harrison Ford is such a likable movie star, and one that audiences can always put their faith in. It's as if his sole reason for getting up in the morning is to entertain, and this he has been doing like no one else for 40 years.\n\n\"Air Force One\" (1997) is just a classic action adventure movie. Ford is the President, flying from Moscow aboard the presidential airplane back to Washington, along with his family and many staffers. The plane has not been in the air long when Gary Oldman, (excellent as always), pops up as the leader of a gang of Russian terrorists who hijack the plane, hellbent on having the President release a hostage who is a general and folk hero. Of course, the US does not negotiate with terrorists -- or does it?\n\nThe Oldman-led terrorists are vicious, but not brilliant. They completely lose track of the president, and he manages to escape into the belly of the plane. His family and staff don't know where he is, either. He manages to use his cell phone to call the White House -- whether that would work or not, I don't know. In any case, he and everyone in the Situation Room devise a plan to neutralize the bad guys and rescue the good guys. It may be far-fetched, yet clichd, predictable stuff, but a good cast, entertaining story and pretty good dialogue make it seem less so.\n\nFord mutters to himself better than any actor, and he gets to do a good bit of that while he's below decks. He is always a step ahead of the terrorists, and he and Oldman face off well. There are some nice little twists and turns.\n\nDon't expect a tremendous amount from \"Air Force One.\" and it won't disappoint. The most startling difference in movies like this made in the late 1990s and those made in the mid-2010s is in the special effects. CGI has completely changed the look of movies, and allows for much greater suspension of disbelief. The action sequences in \"Air Force One\" would have benefited from the now-ubiquitous process, but you can't work with what you don't have.","summary":"\"Get off my plane!\"","unixReviewTime":1426118400,"vote":null,"image":null}

The only memorable line, \"Get off my plane\" didn't warrant a rating higher than two stars, and wasn't enough to make it worth watching a third time (I watched it twice to see if I might have missed further enjoyment, but I didn't). They cast Wendy Crewson; one of Canada's greatest actresses as First Lady, and gave her nothing to do but cower in the corner acting timid. And Glenn Close as Vice President was a commendable choice; if only she hadn't bowed to all the men, even the discussion over the 25th Amendment lacked the anticipation one might expect in the given situation.

What should have been a relaxing trip home, turned out to be a nightmare on a national then global scale. Russian, neo-nationalist terrorists, who wanted their General released from prison, impersonated member's of the media whom they had killed, to be able to board AIR FORCE ONE. These deranged member's of this radical group, relied heavily upon the treachery of one of the U.S. Secret Service Agents who ironically, was assigned to protect the President from just the sort, whom he was now, aiding. And his betrayal to his country, his President and his job assignment was key, to their success. With a hostile take over on the plane and with systematic hostages being executed, what was the U.S. President\/The Commander In Chief, going to do? Especially since, the terrorists were demanding that the plane be re-fueled in the air and re-routed, back to Mother Russia. Thinking that the President had evacuated the plane with the emergency escape pod, the psychotic terrorists, called him a \"...coward!\" Not realizing that he was still aboard and was the only hope for the hostages and flight crew, he was secretly trying to communicate with the White House. By now, the sadistic Russian terrorists knew, that there was a mystery passenger on board who was frustrating and resisting them, successfully. The sociopathic saboteurs were being sabotaged. Meanwhile, the Vice President as played by Academy Award winning Actress Glen Close, is told by the Security Council to write the President off, because he has been missing in action and as of yet, they hadn't heard from him. In this fast paced action drama, you will be at the edge of your seat if not on your feet, with plenty of adrenaline pumping through you, cheering for the President. So, riveting is this film. You are either with the terrorists or with the President. For the Americans or for the Russians. For freedom or for tyranny. There is no middle ground with this movie. And the Secret Service Agent who betrayed the United States, the innocent American hostages, the President, his Secret Service colleagues and his job assignment? Does he ever get his...!! How? Well, you'll just have to watch the movie for yourself and see. It makes for compelling viewing that will make an American Patriot out of you..., if you aren't one already. God Bless the United States of America, it's people, the President and this Great Land and all of it's National freedom's and personal liberties.

Harrison Ford plays a very determined President.  He's determined no to sit by and do nothing when terrorists destroy other countries; he is determined not to negotiate with terrorists; he is determined to save his family and other hostages when terrorists take over Air Force One; and very determined to get their leader off his ship and tells him so.  After that, he's determined to send as many as possible to safety before the ship breaks apart upon impact with the ocean.  He does accomplish his goals with the help of his cabinet via phone calls or fax machine when he is not dodging bullets in various parts of the plane.  Glen Close plays an equally determined Vice President trying to get all the hostages free and save President and his family.  Gary Oldman plays a terrorist leader who is determined to lead Russia into a new Golden Age of power and glory and plans to undermine the President's new policy of not negotiating with terrorists by threatening to kill his family.\n  I have always liked Harrison Ford movies and this is a definite keeper to be watched over and over again.  I liked the fact that I could choose to watch it either wide-screen or full-screen.  This is a movie that needs to be seen in wide-screen. All fans of Harrison Ford will undoubtedly like this film of a man determined to live by his convictions, only to be challenged to dig deep to find the strength and courage to do so when the unthinkable happens.  Those who like a good action adventure will like it as well because it is full of action with fights in a plane being wildly flown, bullets flying everywhere, people either parachuting or falling out said plan, and other adrenaline rush scenes.

Gary Oldman was a complete surprise as the leader of the terrorists hijacking Air Force One.  Oldman was wonderfully menacing throughout, showing us he was capable of anything, no matter how cold-blooded.  While I question the premise of someone actually managing to hijack Air Force One, I still very much like this film and watch it over and over again.

Harrison Ford does a very good president who has a no-nonsense approach to terrorism, led by a cold and merciless terrorist Gary Oldman. The plot is fairly easy to follow, and composer Jerry Goldsmith, who I'd swear Saw composer Charlie Clouser took some tips from) once again has an excellent musical score. Even though I do enjoy this film, I do have a couple issues with it: first, I know Gary Oldman is the primary villian in this film, and the script makes him very easy to hate, more with actions and facial expressions. However, he isn't the only character I couldn't stand, Dean Stockwell as the Defense Secretary, how pathetic, in this case. Aside from Harrison Ford, Glenn Close, the wife played by Wendy Crewson from Good Son and daughter, some characters don't last long enough to even care about. And in movies like this, you have to know the villian has back-up, unfortunately, that cliche has gotten very old for me, along with the \"kill the witness formula\". All that aside, this also set the stage for two other similiar movies recently released in theaters, both that I watched and overall liked-Olympus Has Fallen and White House Down) This film however, seemed like a blueprint for those films, even though, obviously, the new ones, seemed a lot more intense. In those films, however, at least with White House Down, the media was as bad as the terrorists! When it comes to news reporters and tabloid reporters, whatever celebrities want to dish out at them, including violence, dare I say it? Bravo!

This movie is about heroes, more specifically the President of the United States, played beautifully by Harrison Ford. He is a man of strength, character, and wit, and must save his crew from hijackers. When this movie first came out, the story seemed very disturbing to me: a movie made in the U.S. about hijacking our very own presidential aircraft. What a country we live in!! Gary Oldman does a stellar job as the chief bad guy, while William H. Macy is solid as usual. Is there a movie that he (Macy) is NOT in? All in all, Air Force One is an excellent action movie with one heart-pounding moment after another. It depicts courage, love, and humanity. As I alluded to earlier, the story is disturbing, but watching it had me feeling patriotic.","summary":"I like James Marshall's re-election chances","unixReviewTime":1372636800,"vote":null,"image":null}

Roberts","reviewText":"Any resemblance between President Bill Clinton and the Harrison Ford Chief Executive in Wolfgang Petersen's far-fetched, entertaining, but woefully predictable skyjacking saga \"Air Force One\" ends when Ford's fantastic First Guy starts knocking off the villains. Nevertheless, the parallels between Clinton and Marshall appear clearly obvious. Harrison Ford's President James Marshall is married to a tenacious, headstrong wife in the Hilary mode, and they have a 12-year old daughter. (So was Bill Pullman's president in \"Independence Day.\") Unlike Clinton, President Marshall flew helicopter rescue missions in Vietnam and received a Medal of Honor. No, the filmmakers refuse to identify President James Marshall's party affiliation, which make \"Air Force One\" impartially political, while it trumpets America's anti-terrorist stance.\n\nAndrew W. Marlowe's melodramatic screenplay shows more agility than innovation. While his characters emerge as largely one-dimensional stick figures, the dimensions of their predicaments assume nothing less than cataclysmic proportions. Marlowe's script keeps Harrison Ford leaping through enough flaming hoops to fill three movies. Like several other summer blockbusters, Marlowe's script does not know when to throw in the towel. Just about everything that can happen aboard \"Air Force One\" occurs. Presumably, with the recent spate of skyjacking movies, it was only a matter of time before Hollywood appropriated both Air Force One and the President as the pulp of their fictional escapade.\n\nThe movie opens in slam-bang style with an elite American commando team parachuting into Kazakhstan at night. Using the latest hi-tech gear, they kill the palace guards and abduct an adversarial Russian leader, General Radek (Jurgen Prochnow of \"Das Boot\"), who is promptly incarcerated in a Soviet hoosegow. Three weeks later in Moscow, President Marshall stipulates that the U.S. refuses to negotiate with terrorists. Meanwhile, a ruthless ultra-nationalist Radek zealot, Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman of \"True Romance\"), succeeds in smuggling his bogus TV news crew aboard the most secure plane in the world. A disgruntled Secret Service agent, Gibbs (Xander Berkeley of \"L.A. Takedown\"), as we later learn, helped these guys obtain their security clearance. Once the plane is airborne, Korshunov and his men commandeer it, kill the pilots, and watch helplessly s the president ejects in his escape pod. (Does anybody remember \"Escape from New York?\") Ivan contacts the Vice President (Glenn Close) and vows to kill a hostage every half-hour until Radek walks away from prison. According to Defense Secretary Walter Dean (Dean Stockwell), Radek's release would bring down the pro-American regime in the Kremlin and bring back the Cold War, so the Russians are reluctant to set him free unless President Marshall makes the request personally for Radek's release.\n\nThe filmmakers cannibalize in typical Hollywood fashion every neat idea from all the other skyjacking thrillers. Generally, \"Air Force One\" follows the formula of the Kurt Russell hit \"Executive Decision.\" Both movies start with a commando raid and then shift to terrorists hijacking a jetliner before an unconventional hero makes his entry. You can tell that Marlow evidently watch the Wesley Snipes thriller \"Passenger 57\" for one scene. Another scene features a stunt that appeared in both \"Airport 75\" and \"Cliffhanger.\" The president here imitates the action heroes from the Bruce Willis \"Die Hard\" franchise and the Steven Seagal \"Under Siege\" movies. Finally, the \"Air Force One\" ending should come as no surprise to any \"Star Trek\" movie veterans. Anybody who thrives on movies like an insomniac will spot these plot elements. Although \"Air Force One\" borrows heavily from other epics, the staging of the action and some new scenes in the skyjacking formula boost this opus over the rough spots.\n\nAnybody familiar with German director Wolfgang Petersen will recognize the affinity between \"Air Force One\" and his earlier classic U-boat thriller \"Das Boot\"\/\"The Boat\" (1981). The casting of \"Das Boot\" star Jurgen Prochnow as the heinous General Radek aids in this comparison. Moreover, Petersen sends his highly mobile and energetic cameras plunging about the corridors of \"Air Force One\" with the same dexterity that they swept through the hull of the sub in \"Das Boot.\" Despite a connect-the-dots plot, Petersen makes every dot a fire storm of intensity. The scene where the President's jet careens wildly across the airfield in Germany and nearly crashes is pretty harrowing.\n\nFord's presidential protagonist is basically Indiana Jones in a suit and tie. The filmmakers rely on Ford's action hero charisma to compensate for the lack of depth in his inadequately sketched head of state. Shrewdly, they shift gears to the parental side of the chief executive. Ford's best scenes occur before take-off when he asks about his favorite football game. Although Marshall emerges as a cardboard politician, it's his \"Die Hard\" courage that wreathes him with laurels. Unlike those wimpy Jack Ryan movies \"Patriot Games\" and \"A Clear and Present Danger,\" Harrison Ford's hero here kills the villains. The bad guys don't slip out of Marshall's clutches and conveniently impale themselves on sharp objects. (Remember the way the \"Patriot Games\" villain died?) Marshall runs up a body count, kills with a machine gun, snaps necks, and slugs it out with rough and tumble adversaries. Ford is one of the few male box office stars who can shed tears (when Ivan threatens to pull the trigger on his daughter) and not make it look schmaltzy. Ford manages to maintain a stiff upper lip throughout \"Air Force One\" and his scenes with bad guy Gary Oldman crackle with electricity. Ultimately, however, Ford's performance qualifies as serviceable, nothing truly special like the cop the played in \"The Devil's Own\" (1997).\n\nThe real casting coup in \"Air Force One\" is Glenn Close as Vice President Kathryn Bennett. Close manages to hold her own in a room packed with veteran male character actors like \"Quantum Leap's\" Dean Stockwell who constantly bullies Close to usurp presidential authority. Although certainly not the most original skyjacking melodrama, \"Air Force One\" manages to add elements to the formula and boasts enough visceral R-rated violence to keep you distracted throughout its 124-minute running time.","summary":"Tightly Knit Thriller Bristles with Suspense Galore","unixReviewTime":1343433600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Back in the White House Situation Room sits Vice-President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close) trying to cope with it all. Her advisers can't agree, the military folks present various pretty drastic alternatives, and the highjackers have said they will execute one hostage every half hour until their General is released from prison and they have confirmation of the fact.\n\nOK, there's your tip of the iceberg.

Both actors make their performances believable in this movie. Good action movies have to have a great villain. And Oldman definitely provides that in his role.\n\nAfter the successful capture of Radek: a rogue Russian General who has committed genocide on his country's people, U.S. President James Marshall announces to the world in Moscow that America will not tolerate any terrorist organizations. \"It's your turn to live in fear,\" he says to the world. His National Security Advisor (Tom Everett), and Chief of Staff (Paul Guilfoyle) are not happy with this change of policy, but the president doesn't back down. Fortunately, his wife (Wendy Crewson), and his daughter (Liesel Matthews) stand by him on this belief.\n\nAir Force One takes off from Moscow, heading back to Washington. On board is a Russian news crew who were invited on the trip. But then, everything turns to hell when one of the Secret Service agents (Xander Berkeley) kills his fellow men and unlocks a weapons cache. The news crew reveal themselves to be terrorists and quickly hijack the plane. The Secret Service manage to get the President down to an escape pod, which is jettisoned from the plane before they are killed. The terrorists believe that Marshall had escaped in the pod, and then reveal what they want. They tell the Vice President (Glenn Close) to release Radek, or the hostages will be slaughtered one by one.\n\nIt turns out that President Marshall released the pod himself and hid himself away. He understands that it is up to him to save the day. And he fights back against the terrorists one by one. Yes, at this point, AIR FORCE ONE has recycled the same plot as CON AIR, DIE HARD, and UNDER SEIGE: terrorists overpower everyone in a specific place, except for one man, who has to save the day. On top of that, it also borrows from the old AIRPORT disaster films of the 70's: something goes wrong, and now we have to get the plane back on the ground.\n\nThese kind of plots are certainly a cliche. That is true. Done wrong, they can be so incredibly ridiculous as to invite the MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 style wise-cracks. But it's not what kind of plot you use for a movie, it's what you do with it. With AIR FORCE ONE, director Wolfgang Peterson brings in a cast of very gifted actors. Harrison Ford is a great choice as the president. Gary Oldman is not only believable as a villain, he is even given some dialogue that expands on this character. After he shoots a hostage and is called a cold-blooded murderer, he retorts back with this quote: \"You murdered 100,000 Iraqis just so that you could save on a gallon of gas, and you call me a murderer?\" It's also a delight to watch Glenn Close as Vice President Bennett in the Situation Room, along with the great character-actors Dean Stockwell as the Secretary of Defense, and Philip Baker Hall as an Attorney General who advices them on what the Constitution says on the issue.\n\nWolfgang Peterson was determined to make the film as realistic as possible. The other terrorists are played by real Russian actors. I recognized one of them: Elya Baskin, from MOSCOW ON THE HUDSON. In that film he was the fellow circus performer and best friend to Robin Williams. (You may also remember him in the SPIDER MAN movies as Peter Parker's landlord.) In the production notes of AIR FORCE ONE the director, production designer, and Harrison Ford all went on a tour of the real plane. This film depicts the jet in almost complete accuracy. Some creative liberties were taken, of course. But for the most part, we can believe that this is what Air Force One looks like. And on top of this, Harrison Ford does all of his own stunts. He was in his mid-fifties when this film came out in 1997, but he was still in great shape. The United States Air Force actually gave full co-operation in making this film, since it's a very positive kind of movie for this military branch.\n\nAs I said before in the beginning of my review, AIR FORCE ONE is a fun movie. Then-president Bill Clinton loved it. He actually encouraged Glenn Close to play the Vice President before she was cast. I like her, and the other performances. Could such a scenario actually occur on Air Force One? I seriously doubt it. The plane does not have an emergency pod or parachutes in the back. These parts of the film are almost laughable, but it still makes for good entertainment. After seeing this movie, I began to wonder, what if we elected a war hero and Medal Of Honor winner as the President, and ended up with a beautiful woman as The Vice President?","summary":"A fun movie with some great performances","unixReviewTime":1332201600,"vote":null,"image":null}

In the first takeover scene on Air Force One, the bullets go flying literally all around you. The lossless audio is just outstanding.

As a serious film, one star. As a comedy, 5. For me, it's definitely a comedy.\n\nSee the President of the United States engaging in mortal, hand-to-hand combat with armed terrorists! Sure, he's clearly in his fifties, and going up against young, strong, trained combatants; but he's a Fighting President! And nobody, but nobody, is going to take over his plane! (He makes it clear at one point that it's \"my plane!\". Funny, I thought the plane, and the White House, etc., belonged to the people. Guess that's an outdated concept).\n\nMeanwhile, watch the determined Vice President get off the helicopter (not sure why she was flying around in it in the first place) and whirl into action, issuing orders and taking command of the situation. Because she's a Fighting Vice President! Oh, we have a minute or two of the obligatory scene where she and the Secretary of Defense argue about who is in charge, but that's just for show. In the next scene, the Fighting Vice President is still running the show. And doing so brilliantly! Because she's not a figurehead VP, as most are; no, it's made clear that she and the president are good friends and close partners (yep -- that's realistic). Also, she looks exactly like George Washington, so she has that added gravitas. (Don't know what I'm talking about? Go to google images and enter \"glenn close air force one\". Find the picture where she's standing in front of the \"White House\" logo in the press room. Put it next to the image of Washington from a dollar bill.

Look, I'll be non-partisan about it -- imagine either Obama or Bush in hand-to-hand combat with armed terrorists and killing them. My own choice would be Clinton and Gore, who were in office when the movie was made. I think \"Air Force One\" is a great comedy; but if someone would use CGI to replace Harrison Ford and Glenn Close with computer-generated Bill Clinton and Al Gore, and dub their voices in -- well, that would be, by far, the greatest comedy film of all time.","summary":"It's 5 stars, or 1, depending on...","unixReviewTime":1329004800,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

The only thing which marred it for me, occasionally was the lurking thought which would rise to the  surface before I firmly repressed it; what if we really had a President in a crisis who also ignored his oath of office so readily, had no sense of his duty to the country, what if we really had a Vice-President so unwilling to do the hard but necessary things.

Although Kevin Costner was originally in mind to play the President, it would be hard to imagine anyone better suited to this role at the time, than Harrison Ford (Indiana Jones).\n\nPresident James Marshall (Ford) is returning from the Soviet Union, travelling with his staff and family on Air Force One, the President's custom modified 747.  While in flight, terrorists disguised as journalists, take over the plane, led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldham).  Secret service agents rush the President to the escape pod in the lower section of the plane.  The pod is launched, so the terrorists believe that the President has escaped, but he remains hidden aboard.\n\nBack in Washington, Vice President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close), is in charge of the negotiations with Korshunov, who is demanding the release of General Radek (Jurgen Prochnow), a criminal being held in a Soviet prison.  US fighters arrive to escort AF1.  As the Government works to recover the pod, Korshunov begins to execute hostages.  The President communicates with Washington via satellite phone, restating his policy of non-negotiation with terrorists.  This signals Marshall's transition from Commander In Chief, to chief buttkicker.\n\nFinishing as one of the top five grossing films of 1997, AF1 is a classic late 90's mainstream Hollywood blockbuster.  With a huge budget, big stars, special effects, and tons of studio backing, it is Grade A entertainment for the masses, where lovable action hero type, Harrison Ford, dons a superhero cape, and against impossible odds, Marshall saves the day.\n\nFor the film's key element, the producers researched the real AF1, as much as they could, but much about the craft remained classified.  Within that pseudo-realistic framework however, reality is seriously mangled, as Marshall travels with relative ease, and the hull is never breached by a bullet.  The terrorists are terribly inefficient, failing to take immediate control of the cockpit, and letting the President escape.  Oldman's Korshunov, is quite the patriot, when threatening women and a child, but isn't much as commander of men.  The cast also includes William H. Macy (Sahara), Wendy Crewson, Xander Berkley, Paul Guilfoyle (CSI) Dean Stockwell (Quantum Leap), Liesel Mathews (A Little Princess), and Jurgen Prochnow (Das Boot).\n\nWolfgang Petersen is a storyteller, that understands the effective use of action, and he provides an enthusiastic, and informative commentary.  He marvels at the amazing things that were done in the special effects department, which by today's standards, appear quite dated.  Air Force One is an overdramatic, pretentious, but fun fantasy, with a patriotic streak.  It is too bad that today's real problems can't be dealt with so simply.","summary":"faint threads to reality, as the US's Marshall defends freedom . . .","unixReviewTime":1273363200,"vote":null,"image":null}

My earliest recollection of this film is when I was still in grammar school catching the trailer's most infamous and notorious Harrison Ford moment when he quotes, \"Get off my plane\"!. (Priceless) Now, after all of these years have passed I can at least say that this film did not disappoint as the solid acting and fast paced action held my attention throughout the film in it's entirety. Upon viewing this film in the Blu-Ray format it made me regret not seeing it in theaters in a sense. On a more positive note, this blu-ray disc truly utilizes it's full potential of technology; moreover, it's patriotic epic score composed by the one and only Jerry GoldSmith which is also accompanied by a great sounding lossless audio track will really satisfy the home theater buffs. On an even more positive note, I feel this Blu-Ray disc was not far off or short for that in matter in delivering a true realistic theater experience because it was quite superb on many levels. I will elaborate more on these technical specs later but for now I will give a very brief summary here.\n\nPresident Marshall, played by a more youthful looking and middle-aged (Harrison Ford) is held hostage along with his family and staff members on Air Force One after American Special Forces capture general Rodek who is the leader of Kazakhstan. President Marshall leaves a gorgeous and enormous looking Moscow dinner hall after delivering a very brief subdued and yet powerful speech concerning terrorism and foreign policy. Upon boarding the plane we are introduced with Ivan Korshunov who is played by the versatile and ever so impressive (Gary Oldman) While Air Force One is in flight, the audience discovers a mole in the secret service that is able to board Ivan and his other supportive terrorists companions. The secret service wastes no time in starting the bloodshed as he fires two bullets into two cabinet member's heads while they were discussing and briefing on important foreign policy matters. Soon the trails of a smoke grenade released by the secret service man signal Ivan and his ultra radical friends to unleash hell on the president and everyone else on the plane; and, that is exactly what they do because they are incredibly vengeful, bitter and quite keen on releasing General Radek.\n\nSince we are dealing with Blu-Ray technology I always feel it is appropriate and mandatory to analyze and review the technical specs because that is what we are paying top exorbitant dollar for right? If we weren't receiving an upgrade we might as well be buying VHS right?\n\nWell I am astounded to announce that, Blu-Ray fans won't be disappointed in this department either because the picture and sound looks and feels incredibly sharp, precise and most importantly very consistent. Despite the film's age, this disc completely revives and revamps it to a more recent looking film even with the sparse and light 90's grain subtlety prevalent throughout. Fortunately, this minor set back hardly retracts or dilutes any of the overall quality of this pristine transfer. More importantly, flesh tones are smooth and detailed throughout; hair and fabric emit some fine detail particularly in the darker interior shots of the control panel sequences. The blue colored control panel scenes are quite remarkable in the sense that it really enhances facial hair and flesh tone depth to a more elevated level of clarity in any parts of the film. Personally, no other scene compares to this high level of detail in my opinion. This attribute is more specifically shown when Gary Oldman is losing his patience when he frustratingly articulates his demands to the vice president with impunity and anger. Apart from the control panel scenes, the rest of the film does not fail to deliver in expressing some vibrantly smooth scenes in the conference rooms, bag storage area as well as the smaller private rooms (Bathroom, lounge rooms). The majority of the film takes place in the interior of the plane during the night with some interwoven scenes of the white house conference rooms so you will have to keep this in mind in order to regulate any misguided expectations. (In terms of settings, not an entire amount of variety here)\n\nThe Sound is excellent, as the flawless lossless 5.1 audio will give all your speakers quite a bit of attention; the dialogue is crisp, articulate, clean and very pleasing. I was able to make out every spoken word without any complications. You will truly appreciate the opening-firing scene at the headquarters in Kazakhstan when general Rodek is captured. Moreover, AK-47's, Mp5 and Mp5k's fire and pierce with unbelievable force and dominance, but that's not even the bread and butter here folks. The automatic sub-machine guns truly immerse you in its breath taking firepower during the first plane shootout when the terrorists kill the majority of the President's staff on board. Listen carefully to the bullets ricocheting off metal stairs or penetrating through bathroom doors. I fully appreciated the gunfire sounds in the bag storage area where President Marshall hides; it is quite impressive and mesmerizing actually. One will also quickly observe how much attention is given to the sub-woofer and rear channel speakers during the exterior night shots of the plane in fight; engines will roar loudly and thoroughly producing a strong vibration in any floor of your house. As a result, this creates a very strong acoustical sound range leading the front channel speakers and gradually dissolving to the rear. The introduction of the F-16 fighter jets following Air Force One leaves no speaker unscathed; the incessant accelerating engine power might cause one to grip on to their seats. (Well, at lease for me it did) These types of aerial vehicular sounds are nicely calculated in between scenes of dialogue and dominate the last half-hour of the film. Even though I have never seen this film on standard dvd I feel it is appropriate and safe to say that this is a serious upgrade for home theater fans. Although I wouldn't say this is an outstanding Blu-Ray film, I will say it is a solid one because it delights and pleases wherever possible. In that regard, it is worth the purchase.\n\nIn regards to the acting, Harrison Ford Fans or in my case die-hard Gary Oldman fans will be impressed here. A multi-talented and quite younger Gary Oldman emits a more vengeful and retrained type of villain here as opposed to some of the former impulsive, unbalanced psychotic characters he plays. His anger is explosive and expected when provoked and his calmness is professional when in control; he practically has zero empathy for anyone on board as he kills relentlessly with his crew. Harrison Ford, on the other hand, plays a very likeable president; his assertiveness and confidence in times of panic and danger will definitely satisfy his plausibility as an authority figure as well as a favorable president. Besides the main actors, Glenn Close ( The Vice president) along with William H. Macy and Wendy Crewson (the first lady) are serviceable to say the very least.\n\nIn conclusion, Air Force One will definitely please most fans of far-fetched action packed high explosive films while simultaneously satisfying the technical crowd who thoroughly enjoy seeing their films being treated in a careful and respectful manner.","summary":"Adrenaline Inducing?

Why'd I watch it, then?  I guess I was in the mood for this kind of techno-thriller, in which the President's plane is hijacked by terrorists, and our middle-aged President (Ford) who was formerly a Vietnam combat pilot gets to play hero and almost single-handedly take out the Russian bad guys headed up by nasty psycho Gary Oldman and prevent them from returning evil commie Jurgen Prochnow back to power in Kazakhstan.  Complications include the President's wife and daughter being on board, and disagreements between principal cabinet members (chiefly Glenn Close as the VP and Dean Stockwell as the Secretary of Defense) on how best to handle the situation on the ground; the latter element never builds up to anything convincingly suspenseful.\n\nLike a great many of these kinds of films, AIR FORCE ONE started out pretty well and went downhill both in believability and interest in the second half, but it never fell apart completely despite one really annoying plot hole that apparently the producers, screenwriter Andrew W. Marlowe and\/or director Wolfgang Petersen thought we'd be too stupid to think about:  namely that there's a spy on board in the form of a Secret Service agent, we know about him and the people on the ground know about him, but very little if any effort is made to clue the President in about him - and he basically gets ignored by both the terrorists and everyone else until the very end.  And his motives are never mentioned at all - he just turns rogue because, uh, he thought it would be fun, perhaps?  Not good enough, sorry.\n\nStill, this was more lively and intelligent than it could have been; Ford is OK and the rest of the cast is game enough, if not quite enthusiastic except for the always manic Oldman - who is playing basically the same role he's played a dozen times now.  Worth a watch if you like these sorts of things; better than DIE HARD 2 or 4, EXECUTIVE DECISION, or the UNDER SIEGE films, I'd say, to name some movies with comparable plots from the era.  Petersen is never IMO less than a competent director, and he keeps things moving along OK.  The ra-ra patriotic Jerry Goldsmith score got old and pretty overbearing after a half hour.\n\nA time waster, then, but a reasonably enjoyable one.  The standard DVD doesn't have too much in the way of extras, nothing really of substance besides the director's commentary, which I haven't listened to.","summary":"Fairly typical techno-thriller one of Ford's better late efforts","unixReviewTime":1256515200,"vote":null,"image":null}

This thing covers a couple of days in the life of the girls and leads up to a monumental concert at the Albert Hall in London. It begins at the end of one concert in one town, at the end of which they board their Union Jack-covered tour bus and move on. Thing is, the bus is more than ten times bigger on the inside than the outside, a tribute to \"Doctor Who\", I gather. That's when the fun really starts.\n\nIf you want a serious documentary like one about the Beatles, or the Rolling Stones or the Who, that tries to discuss the more serious influences the Spice Girls have made on our culture, you can fergitabutet, although one of the film's character's is a documentary-maker trying to do just that. Like the Girls themselves, this film is never meant to be taken seriously.  It pokes fun at everything in true British Spike-Mulligan \"Monty Python\" style. It kids VIP parties, publicity photo sessions, girls being girls, \"Charlie's Angels\", haunted house themes, army sergeant-majors, news happenings, and the BBC.  There's a newspaper magnate so tired of the group that he's willing to jump on anything that may cause them to disband. There's George Wendt as a Hollywood producer eager to make some sort of film about the Girls and is full of daffy ideas for it. There's Richard Grant as the Girls' hysterical road manager.  There are cameos by Sir Elton John, Sir Elvis Costello ( interesting the amount of knighthoods handed out to major entertainers during the Tony Blair premiership), Stephan Fry, Hugh Laurie, Bob Hoskins, and Jennifer Saunders (\"Absolutely Fabulous\"), among others.  And there's Sir Roger Moore as the Girl's All-Highest Manager, kidding his own James Bond image. Though I'd agree with other reviewers that the \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" take-off is perhaps a bit much. Is this to show how the appeal of the Spice Girls is truly \"universal\"  or something?\n\nThe Spice Girls themselves are sporting enough to put themselves through any sort of gag. They always kid themselves and each other and preach \"Gil Powah,\" while Posh herself already shows her interest in clothes. And of course they sing their greatest hits, which aren't too bad, though the lyrics being subtitled means you could risk having those syrupy-sweet songs being stuck in your head for some time.\n\nThe Spice Girls' fad seems to be over now, but it looked like they had a great time while they were around. And \"Spice World\", while certainly not nearly as great a film as \"A Hard Day's Night,\" tells it all.","summary":"A Guilty Pleasure With Some Good Fun Inside","unixReviewTime":1422403200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Amith","reviewText":"In the Summer of 1997, audiences were treated with another action film from Harrison Ford.  During the 1990's, Ford has made quite a number of successful action films but his performance in \"AIR FORCE ONE\" was truly an example that this Hollywood veteran still had what it takes to be an action star.\n\nThe film was directed by well-known action director Wolfgang Petersen (\"The Perfect Storm\", \"Troy\", \"Outbreak\", \"Das Boot\"), music by well-known composer Jerry Goldsmith (\"Rambo\", \"Star Trek: First Contact\", \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\",  \"Basic Instinct\") and Director of Photography by Michael Ballhaus (\"Gangs of New York\", \"The Departed\", \"Wild Wild West\").\n\nThe film was received positively by critics and a success in the box office as it brought in over $315 million worldwide.  \"AIR FORCE ONE\" even received attention from President Bill Clinton who enjoyed the film and watched it twice.  The film would go on to receive two Academy Award nominations for \"Best Film Editing\" and \"Best Sound\".\n\nVIDEO & AUDIO:\n\n\"AIR FORCE ONE\" features a pretty solid transfer on Blu-ray.  Video is presented in 1080p High Definition (aspect ration of 2:40:1) and one thing that I will make clear is that while many films featured in the 90's tend to have a DNR, clean, waxy or soft effect in terms of picture quality, the good news is that \"AIR FORCE ONE\" does not.\n\nIn fact, there are scenes where the detail comes out quite nicely.  But if there was one thing that the Blu-ray High Definition transfer does happen to bring out is the amount of grain.  But I would rather take a transfer full of grain than the soft, waxy DNR look any day.  And I am so happy that Sony Pictures Home Entertainment decided to feature \"AIR FORCE ONE\" with a good HD transfer of the film.\n\nAs for the audio, I have one word and that is \"magnificent\".\n\n\"AIR FORCE ONE\" has one of the most impressive soundtracks that I have heard from a 1990's film.  The soundtrack just sounds absolutely wonderful on English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (the film is also featured in French Dolby TrueHD 5.1).\n\nThe film features a high number of action scenes and gunfire, music, mechanical sounds from the vehicles, jet engines flying, helicopter rotors spinning, it would seem that so much was put into the emphasis of having a wonderful soundtrack that \"AIR FORCE ONE\" truly delivers. And these are not short bursts of audio, there are plenty of scenes that utilize this explosive audio throughout the film.\n\nI was absolutely in awe of how all the speakers were being utilized, especially my surround channels  and I also noticed a few times where my subwoofer would utilize low frequency sounds.  \"AIR FORCE ONE\" is an action thriller that truly delivers with its audio that I can say that this is one of the better sounding action thrillers from the 1990's that just shines on Blu-ray.  And just to think that this film is 12 years old.  I was absolutely thrilled by the audio quality of the film.\n\nAs for subtitles, the film is presented in English, English SDH and French.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES:\n\n\"AIR FORCE ONE\" features a commentary track by Director Wolfgang Petersen and Michael Coleman.  This is the same commentary from the DVD release but there is good information from Petersen on scenes that were actual aerial shots and not CG and which parts were shot on a set and were CG'd.  Also, learning about his feelings towards his cast members, Harrison Ford especially and how Ford did his own stunt work.\n\nBD Live is also enabled and there are commercials in 1080p for upcoming releases from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.\n\nJUDGMENT CALL:\n\nI am a big Harrison Ford fan and I watched this film immediately when it came out on theaters.  My first impression was that Harrison Ford should definitely be President because it was like a combination of a President meets DIE HARD's John McClane.  Well, not really but Harrison Ford's role as a President who fights back was definitely a highlight throughout the film.\n\nOne thing that I know is when a film is being directed by Wolfgang Petersen, the viewer is definitely going to be treated with an exceptional, action-packed film and \"AIR FORCE ONE\" is just that.  Even 12 years later and this film still holds up quite well.  Petersen and everyone involved in this film did a wonderful job and I have to say that this is my favorite Harrison Ford action thriller to come out in the 1990's.  He manages to have the suave, charisma and that look and feel of an action star but in this case, he's the President of the United States.\n\nBut for those who own the DVD of \"AIR FORCE ONE\", you may be wondering if its worth the double dip?  I have to answer with an extreme \"YES!!!\".  The soundtrack of \"AIR FORCE ONE\" is top notch and I will say that its one of the most immersive soundtracks I have heard on Blu-ray.  Also, bare in mind, this is not a new action film, this was a film released in the Summer of 1997 and it can compete with some of the recent, bigger releases on Blu-ray.  That is how magnificent this film sounds on Blu-ray.\n\nIf there were faults in the Blu-ray transfer, its the fact that there are not many special features included.  Just the audio commentary but no HD trailer and no making of featurette.  The other thing is that although the film looks better than many 1990's film on Blu-ray and avoids the waxy, DNR look but with its HD transfer, grain is elevated.  Though not too bad, it is noticeable and this may be a slight issue for some viewers but I tend to be on side of grain is part of film and high definition elevates the look of grain.  And personally, I would rather take the grain than a transfer with a lot of DNR or edge enhancement.\n\nOverall, \"AIR FORCE ONE\" is a magnificent action-packed thriller and a film that Harrison Ford truly shines in.  And as for the Blu-ray, this is the definitive version of \"AIR FORCE ONE\" to own!","summary":"Blu-ray: \"AIR FORCE ONE\" is an audiophile's dream!  Incredible lossless audio!

Harrison Ford once again plays the reluctant hero, and plays it very well. This is a great film if you want to sit back and be entertained without having to think too much. It will not set your world on fire but you will enjoy it,The picture quality is very good with a nice anamorphic transfer and very few marks on the print, This film may suffer from a slightly unbelievable story line but when you have Harrison Ford, Gary Oldman and Glenn Close delivering performances as strong as these, In this action packed blockbuster, Hollywood legend Harrison Ford stars as President Marshall on board the presidential plane Air Force 1. 1000's of feet in the air President Marshall is horrified when he discovers that the plane has been hijacked by communist radicals. Unless he meets the demands of Korshunov (radicals leader), everyone on board Airforce One will be executed. As well as having to save his own skin the President also faces the daunting prospect of having to rescue his wife and daughter from the jaws of death.\n\nIn a film which sees the President's daughter held at gunpoint and his plane chased by Russian fighter jets, Air Force One takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions. This thriller has more twists and turns than the River Nile and is bound to keep you on the edge of your seat right through to the closing credits.\n\nAs well as having an excellent plot that keeps both the mind and eye stimualted, the quality of the acting and special effects used make a major contribution to the film. Any movie which features a household name such as Harrison Ford usually guarantees acting of the highest quality and Air Force One is no exception. Ford maintains his reputation as being a top class yet versatile actor in a career that has seen his roles range from playing an outer space cowboy through to an adventurer in the deepest jungle. Although not in the same league as the Indiana Jones or Starwars trilogy.","summary":"Sit Back & Enjoy","unixReviewTime":1151107200,"vote":null,"image":null}

It gives us the president of our dreams, a president of mythic virtues, and then shows him desperately at risk.\n\nThe catch is that the audience must believe that it's watching the president of the United States. Buy it, and ``Air Force One,'' now out on video, is halfway home. Don't buy it, and the film becomes a preposterous thriller.\n\nFortunately, the film finds in Harrison Ford the one actor who can fully inhabit two kinds of grandeur -- action-movie bigness and the aura of the presidency. He has the ego and the intelligence for the job. He has the Gary Hart hair. He also has a quality that Americans perhaps are nostalgic for -- sincerity.\n\nAs President James Marshall, Ford is beyond sincere. He is an impassioned visionary. We meet him for the first time at a Kremlin banquet in his honor, giving a speech in which he's about to implode with rage and moral fervor. ``It's your turn to be afraid!'' he warns terrorists. By the time Gary Oldman, as an obsessed Kazak super-nationalist, and his band of Communist mal contents hijack the president's Boeing 747, the act seems like a chilling violation.\n\nThere's a violence to ``Air Force One'' that's simply not present in the more cartoonish action films. Bullets rip nasty holes into doors, and the sound of gunshots in the confined space of the presidential plane is a jolt. Oldman's enjoyment in murdering defenseless people makes the violence more personal and frightening. Director Wolfgang Petersen's action fantasy escalates into midair dogfights and elaborate stunts that have people dangling from the Air Force One parachute ramp and later trying to transfer via a cable to a rescue aircraft. There is a tone of confident military heroics and almost a reverence for the presidency that seem a throwback to World War II propaganda movies. ``Air Force One'' might not be the role of Ford's career, but it might be the ultimate role of his maturity.","summary":"Just saw it again.

The best example of that is when the President's Deputy Press Secretary Melanie Mitchel, played by Donna Bullock, is killed in cold blood in front of the Presidents wife and daughter. It is a very disturbing scene and a bit too much.\n\nDespite the violence the movie was a summer popcorn type of film that takes you on an adrenaline filled roller coaster ride of thrills and terror, and in that way it does succeed. Harrison Ford is excellent as the action-hero President. He is a strong yet human character who responds in heroic fashion under extraordinary circumstances. Gary Oldman plays the evil Ivan Korshunov only too well. The one performance that I find annoying is Dean Stockwell's portrayal of Defense Secretary Walter Dean. He doesn't come across as authoritative but rather almost childishly whinny. The movie does also go on a bit too long when the ending rescue is dragged out. Despite its flaws it is still a good action movie made even better by the performance of Harrison Ford.","summary":"A Good Action Movie, However...","unixReviewTime":1141603200,"vote":null,"image":null}

With all members of the Secret Service dead and the terrorists threatening to kill a hostage every half-hour until a prisoner is released from a Russian jail, it is up to Marshall to stop the terrorists. Will he be able to stop the terrorists and save his family?\n\nOkay, in this type of film viewers know from the beginning that the good guys are going to win and the bad guys are going to lose, badly, but not before lots of people die. But, while somewhat predictable, and highly implausible, this is still a good thriller, with plenty of edge of your seat chills. There's just enough twist on the action adventure formula to keep the viewer from guessing what will happen next.\n\nDirector Wolfgang Petersen deserves most of the credit for making this film work as well as it does. There are plenty of thrilling action sequences, especially the one that closes out the movie. Harrison Ford is a bit stiff as the President at the beginning of the film, but loosens up and does fine once he gets into action hero mode. Gary Oldman is wonderfully creepy as the main terrorist. Glenn Close and Dean Stockwell do fine as the Vice President and Defense Secretary. William H. Macy is, as always, perfect in a supporting role. Wendy Crewson is also good as the First Lady.\n\nThis is a good action adventure film.","summary":"Good Action Adventure Film","unixReviewTime":1130976000,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

It's an amazing film, and I was practically sitting on the edge of my seat, talking (yes, I was) to the TV, saying \"don't do that\" and other such nonsense.\n\nI've never been a big fan of Harrison Ford, but I'm not sure why. Gary Oldman also gives me the creeps! But I find that films on planes are always filled with suspense, and lots of action. It's probably cos it's all filmed in a confined space. Hey I like these kinda films. And I have to say that Gary Oldman did brilliantly speaking in Russian. He probably wasn't speaking what was coming up on the screen in the subtitles ;) but it didn't come across as forced, or unrealistic, like some actors would do an accent.\n\nMy problem with this was the ending. It's one of those films, where just as you think it's about to end, something else happens, and by the very end, it was starting to feel a bit dragged out, and just a bit OTT.\n\nI did find the movie quite realistic in a way, as with Harrison Ford playing the president, and not knowing the number to phone through to the White House (someone else must do all this stuff for the presidents.) And it was good stuff having the vice president as a women. Very un-Hollywood. And they also had Glenn Close not bowing under pressure as her character, when she was being pressured to do other things, give in to the Russians etc.\n\nThis soundtrack is really good, and the main theme is a really feel good theme. Although I didn't recognise the theme being played to me straight afterwards - I thought that was just too easy! Randy Newman's score was cut late in post-production by director Wolfgang Petersen for being \"too loud and blatty.\" Jerry Goldsmith was brought in to do the score in TWO weeks. Can you imagine doing a score in two weeks? He was so daunted by the amount of time he had to write the score that he began requesting that his assignments be given to him months in advance of the finishing of a film's final cut.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this film, despite the drawn-out ending, and would most likely watch it again. Gary Oldman still scares me however.","summary":"Felt like it was never going to end","unixReviewTime":1127520000,"vote":null,"image":null}

I like it when people do the right things for the right reasons and the results are good. I guess I'm old fashioned that way. That is what this film is like.\n\nHarrison Ford plays the president. He is not just any US president; he is a former war hero and he means what he says. He stands up for what is right. While returning from a state visit to Russia, his plane gets hijacked by terrorists. The secret service manages to get the president to an escape pod and get the pod launched. When it is recovered, the president is not on board. He is still on Air Force One with the bad guys and his family and staff. He's hacked off and goes about taking care of business. For him, that means taking care of his people.\n\nThe bad guys are as bad and vicious as they can be. The good guys are scared but, mostly, they are honorable and try to do the right thing. I wish real life was like that.\n\nThe film is filled with twists and turns. It is also filled with unexpected \"cliffhanger\" moments. To relieve the tension, it also has some great light moments.\n\nWatch this one when you have time to sit through the whole thing.

While admittedly *today* in real life there would be intense security to prevent this from happening, it seems a highly plausible plot for a film, especially in 1997 when it was made. The world sat in disbelief when it was announced at a TV  press conference that Kazakhstan terrorists hold the U.S. President James Marshall, delegates, and various family members as hostages up on Air Force One not long after boarding the plane in Russsia. Communications between Glenn Close, the U.S. Vice President, a prisoner on Air Force One and the U.S. Press Secretary in Washington confirmed their status ...\n\nHarrison Ford plays the U.S. President with fearlessness and cunning. He also demonstrates superb hand-to-hand fighting skills plus superior technical expertise with a gun. He becomes the hero who manages to elude the terrorists when he remains one level below, as they overtake the pilot and copilot. He creates diversions and thwarts their various plans, all the while evading detection. Initially, they are unaware whom they are fighting. Once Ivan Korshunov, the leader, realizes it is the President of the United States who nearly single-handedly prevents them from achieving their goals, the terrorist becomes more vicious. He threatens the wife of the President at gun point and turns on the loudspeaker so the President can listen as she voices her fears. This enrages the President who takes even more serious measures to save their lives: he dumps fuel to force them to stop. The fighting scenes are unparalleled yet eventually Harrison Ford is captured. The capture of the President forces the United States to negotiate with the terrorists, despite their policy against doing so. The terrorists want the release of General Alexander Radek, the former ruler of Kazakhstan ...\n\nThe rescue of the President, delegates and their families is breath-taking. Fortunately, some manage to jump with parachutes but there are not enough and time is running out ... Air Force One does not have the ability to land. There is a daring awe-inspiring rescue up in the air at 15,000 feet. General Alexander Radek is released from his prison cell, dressed in his well-decorated uniform as he walks across the prison courtyard ... and in the end, justice prevails. Viewing this film sends chills up and down one's spine because despite the many aspects of the film that are exaggerated - terrorism is one area that *thankfully* is *not* depicted in its true scope given what we know of the events of 9-1-1 and current Iraqi War.

(2000's WHAT LIES BENEATH probably made money, but few credit Ford's presence in that thriller for its success; possibly it was a hit due to the well-tuned script and the expert direction by Robert Zemeckis. In any case Michelle Pfeiffer--another star of the 1990s whose career has gone sadly awry--deserves half the credit as well.)  Otherwise it's like a list of one disaster after another.  K-19 THE WIDOWMAKER?  Dead in the water.  HOLLYWOOD HOMICIDE?  Not a bad show but the public stayed away in droves.  RANDOM HEARTS?  When you look up \"catastrophe\" in the dictionary you get a still from this movie.  SIX DAYS SEVEN NIGHTS?  Awful.  WATER TO WINE (2004)?  Even his fans don't know what it is!  I'm not sure FIREWALL will break the curse either, it sounds like a re-tread of an earlier Ford flop called FRANTIC.\n\nSo when we look back and try to find the last good patch of Harrison Ford's once invincible streak, we come up with a thump against this indisputable box office sensation, which rules the theaters world wide for a brief spell in 97.  The critics thought it piffle, but it answered a need in the US public, maybe to see a strong president defying the Russians one last time.  Reactionary?  No two moviegoers will read its plot the same way, but there are certainly cimilarities to the FOX TV hit \"24,\" which it foreshadowed in so many ways, even down to the canny use of amiably sinister Xander Berkeley, the husband in SAFE.  And of course the death defying traumas that occur to Air Force One in both programs.\n\nMost of all, I think people long for a president who's more like James Marshall here, than the one we had in 1997 or the one we have now.  He's a father figure, he's still vigorous and sexy, he's got a good sense of humor, knows his way around a gun AND he protects us from the threat of Glenn Close.\n\nAIR FORCE ONE itself was a sort of comeback project for the beleaguered Ford, whose previous films had been major disappointments--the terrible SABRINA remake and the muddled IRA thriller DEVIL'S OWN with Brad Pitt.  I think at that minute we really needed Harrison Ford to start thinking about how to sustain a career.  Instead he just must have said Ah Screw It and switched the remote to a then-new TV show called ALLY McBEAL.  The rest is film history.","summary":"His last real success","unixReviewTime":1118620800,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

Maybe...maybe not. Obviously on Air Force One he's a superman, because he is able to do all these things.\n\nAir Force One needs to come down out of the clouds and have some reality shot into it.

In Air Force One, Ford plays the role of President of the United States. In the same way that it's near impossible to envision any other actor in the role of Indiana Jones, it's difficult to envision anyone else as president for this film. Ford projects the image of such a strong, honorable, and likeable leader that the audience is immediately rooting for him.\n\nOriginally released in 1997, Ford plays President James Marshall, a Vietnam vet turned president who makes it clear in a stunning speech at a Moscow dinner that America will now pursue a \"zero tolerance\" policy on international terrorism (sound familiar?). Boarding Air Force One for the return flight home from Moscow, Marshall is joined by his wife Grace (Wendy Crewson) and his daughter Alice (Liesel Matthews). He's also joined by a contingent of Eastern European journalists led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman).\n\nUnbeknownst to the President and his fellow Air Force One passengers, the group of men aren't journalists at all, but instead an elite team of terrorists bent on taking the president hostage. With a Secret Service agent (Xander Berkeley) collaborating with the terrorists, Korshunov has intimate inside knowledge of the procedures and safeguards deployed to protect the president on Air Force One. When Secret Agent Gibbs (Berkeley) opens the onboard weapons cache of Air Force One, his terrorist friends carry out a methodic plan to eliminate the president's security circle.\n\nAt the sound of gunfire, President Marshall is hurriedly raced below deck to an escape pod so as to avoid his capture. With the pod jettisoned, Korshunov is enraged that the original plan failed. But his original goal remains intact, and the terrorist decides that the president's family and the remaining passengers will make do as hostages. Negotiating with the acting Vice President (Glenn Close) in the President's absence, Korshunov demands the release of General Ivan Radek (Jurgen Prochnow), a communist hardliner who Korshunov believes will bring back the Soviet Union and restore the intoxicating glory of its empire years. With a well laid and executed plan, Korshunov's demands are met and arrangements are made to release General Radek. But what Korshunov doesn't know is that President Marshall is still onboard, having jettisoned an empty escape pod, and he's intent on freeing his family and kicking the terrorists off his plane...\n\nFilled with action and some memorable one-liners, Air Force One is a classic Harrison Ford action thriller along the lines of Patriot Games and Clear And Present Danger. In addition, prior to filming Air Force One, the producers were given unprecedented access to the real thing. The result is a film that displays the inner sanctums of Air Force One with stunning accuracy, providing the audience with a glimpse into the actual traveling life of the most powerful man in the world. Overall, this a must-see movie that you won't want to miss...\n\nThe DVD Report","summary":"Will make you wish James Marshall (Harrison Ford) were prez!","unixReviewTime":1113782400,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

It has all of the essential elements of a great action movie; great script, good directing, above-average acting, a reasonable amount of special effects, plenty of twists, and lots of action.  \"Air Force One\" takes but a few minutes to set the stage, introduce the main characters, and let the events begin to come together.\n\nHarrison Ford is the president, with a solid military past, whose plane is taken over by Russian reactionary militants.  The concept that the events of this struggle would primarily take place on a jumbo jet adds to the excitement; there's no running away (although it may, at times, seem that there is).  I won't go over the plot because, if you haven't seen \"Air Force One\" yet, you won't want to know what's next.\n\nI noticed that some previous reviews had a few objections about various technical and political aspects of the movie.  Yes, there are plenty of bullets flying around while everyone is flying around.  However, I dismissed that as an aspect of the latest in aviation technology as would exist on Air Force One.  Ironically, the idea of terrorists hijacking Air Force One is more believable today than when the movie came out.  My pet peeve with the movie has to do with the failure to properly explain how an inside member of the President's circle could be the one to aid and abet this takeover.  In the several times I've seen the movie, this matter has never satisfactorily been explained.

He started off in the mid - 1970s' as Han Solo in the \"Star Wars\" series. Then, his starpower went through the roof with the \"Indiana Jones\" trilogy. After a dry spell, he bounced back as CIA agent Jack Ryan in 1992's \"Patriot Games\" and its sequel \"Clear And Present Danger\". In the interim between these two films, he starred as Richard Kimble in \"The Fugitive\".  In the 1997 vehicle \"Air Force One\", he played an unlikely action hero - The President Of The United States\".\nFord is President James Marshall. He seems to be the embodyment of the American dream. He has a loving family, and seems to be the leader in the upcoming election now that he's captured a Russian general responsible for the death of millions. But that all changes when he announces that the United States will no longer negotiate with terrorists at a convention in Moscow. But that all changes on the flight back to Washington. A group of Russian terrorists led by Gary Oldman hijack Air Force One. When they threaten to kill, Ford is forced to choose between going against his policy or sacrifying lives of the passangers on board - including his wife and daughter.

On his way home from Russia, after his remarkable pronouncement, Air Force One is hijacked by terrorists led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman).  They are determined to win the freedom of General Ivan Radek (Jurgen Prochnow), a military leader who murdered thousands of people in his bid for power.  The secret service agents on the plane sacrificed themselves to get the President into the escape pod in the belly of the plane, leaving the President's closest advisors, as well as his wife and daughter, at the mercy of the terrorists...\nVice President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close) immediately tries to negotiate with the terrorists to get the hostages off the plane alive while the military follows the beacon to the president's escape pod.  Everything changes when the escape pod is found - empty.  President James Marshall never left the plane and he is determined to make the terrorists pay.  However, the terrorists quickly notice that their numbers are dwindling and assume that there is a secret service agent loose on the plane.  They begin killing hostages in the hopes that they will find one that matters enough to the unknown man for him to give himself up.  With the clock ticking and increasing numbers of hostages being murdered, President Marshall soon finds that he is forced into negotiating with the terrorists and arranging for the release of General Radek from prison.  But that doesn't mean that he is beaten as he uses every trick in the book to get the terrorists off his plane...\nAir Force One is a great movie.  It is fast paced, full of action and you almost instantly identify with the characters, especially Harrison Ford, as we have seen him play the president so many times that it is instantly believable.  It is true that many of the details of the movie are obviously fantasy, such as the mythical escape pod (that doesn't exist on the real Air Force One), the ease with which the terrorists boarded the plane, and the constant firing of weapons on the plane without ever puncturing anything important, but the director is so talented and the cast so believable that you don't really think of any of this until after the movie is over.

Macy, and Dean Stockwell, Air Force One's premise is simple: Russian ultra-Communist terrorists take over the President's plane on its way back to the U.S. from Moscow.  Marshall, who by happenstance is separated from his family and staff during the takeover, must use his military training (he's a former Air Force pilot) and his wits to regain control of Air Force One and rescue the hostages before the terrorists achieve their aims.\nThe terrorists, led by Ivan Korshunov (Oldman), are seeking the immediate release of General Alexander Radek (Jurgen Prochnow), who was snatched from his palace in Kazakhstan by a joint team of Russian and American Special Forces.  Radek and his followers believe in the restoration of the old Soviet Union, and until both Russia and the U.S. intervened, had ruled Kazakhstan with as much regard for human life as the Taliban exhibited when they ruled Afghanistan.  After a ceremony hosted by the grateful Russian President in which Marshall warns rogue nations and terrorists that \"we will no longer be afraid. It's your turn to be afraid,\" the American delegation heads to one of Moscow's main airports to board the Presidential plane.\nLittle do they know that Korshunov and his team, using falsified press credentials, have passed through both Russian and American security and are aboard.  Ironically, they are given a tour of Air Force One by the unsuspecting assistant press secretary, Melanie Mitchell  (Donna Bullock). And why not? To the Secret Service agents and the Air Force Security detachment, Korshunov and his people are reporters, harmless and unarmed. So how in the world are these guys going to storm Air Force One, \"the most secure aircraft in the world?\"  Hmmm....and why do Korshunov and Secret Service agent Gibbs (Xander Berkeley) exchange that glance as they pass each other, eh?\nPetersen and screenwriter Andrew W. Marlowe never do explain Gibbs' motivations for his subsequent actions (as the director admits in the audio commentary track), but by the time audiences start asking those \"real life\" questions about plausibility, the sheer adrenaline rush provided by this action-packed film suppresses the \"yeah, right\" response to its premise.  The Air Force (which willingly participated in the production of this film) says there is no escape pod in Air Force One's list of defensive measures, and viewers know that no sane person, whether terrorist or not, is going to fire automatic weapons inside an airborne plane unless he or she knew the mission was going to fail anyway.\nMixed in with the gunfire and explosions that punctuate the film, Petersen and Marlowe endow their characters with depth and believability.  Petersen makes viewers care about each person being held hostage, warts and all, so that when one is lost,  it feels real.  Even Korshunov is played in such way that his motivations feel true and heartfelt, even if his cause is not just.\nYet Petersen and his cast and crew make audiences forget these dull real life facts.  By the time the credits roll to Jerry Goldsmith's rousing End Title Suite, the viewer will wish the current occupant of the Oval Office were replaced by Harrison Ford's President Marshall, who is not only a man of political integrity but also a man of action.","summary":"\"Get off my plane!\"","unixReviewTime":1061942400,"vote":37.0,"image":null}

Gary Oldman plays an excellent terrorist, and Harrison Ford's President is the kind of hands-on hero that would prompt a repeal of the 22nd Amendment (for those unsavvy of the Constitution, that's the one that limits Presidents to two terms).\nThe action ride simply does not quit as it begins with the hijackers' takeover of Air Force One (with the help of a traitorous Secret Serviceman) and the President's apparent escape to Ford's battle to retake the plane and rescue his staff to a near-landing at Ramstein AFB in Germany to the in-air refueling to MiGs firing upon Air Force One to the final confrontation... nor like some films is the pacing flawed so that the watcher is drained or left wanting after the first few scenes; Air Force One simply keeps viewers on the edges of their seats for the entire film.\nIf you enjoy action films, you will love Air Force One.","summary":"The Action Movie That Doesn't Quit","unixReviewTime":1050364800,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

St Thomas","reviewText":"I rewatched this movie just last night (April 13th, 2003), to see what messages it actually uses to play on people's fears and misconceptions about the world around America. At times embarassing, at times eerily in tune with current events, and at all times constantly questioning one's own common sense. Hollywood is always seeking to entertain and distract its audience, but putting such political issues in focus without any thought or plausibility insults those with any mind to question.\nLet's just say this is a theatre piece, and dramatic elements have to be employed to add to the plot or sequence of events. That this, and so many movies of its kind employ the use of Russians as the enemy (usually using a British actor to supply the villainy) perpetuates stereotypes and misinformation that has existed since the Cold War's birth. I loved the fact that America was seen as a bastion of technology, with blinking lights and computer screens, and intercoms, technology at the helm, while Russia and its leader had a little red phone and a bear on his table. Fantastic. It automatically sets up a perception that Russia is weaker on all fronts, and the victor will always be America, so the whole premise of the film being America in danger is compromised by its visualisation of its power as compared to Eastern Europe. It throws the whole plot out the window by default.\nApart from its Nationalistic stance, the dialogue of the film borders on the ludicrous to outright childlike. The only bite that is heard in this film is from the actual enemy (portrayed by Gary Oldman) when questioning the President's (Harrison Ford) moral constitute when dealing with his Oldman's homeland. The points raised were the only plausible or believeable lines in this movie, but it all too quickly falls into the 'remake Rambo' style of filmmaking too many times. This is just entertainment for the masses, and does not ask any questions of moral fortitude or revenge, or anything actually relevant to anything in any real world situation. Should I take this movie just as it is, entertainment, or for what it represents, 'Horse Blinker' propaganda aimed at the public.\nI cannot guess why films like this get made???? All that money wasted on a piece of junk. The CGI throughout is quite weak, especially the 'crash' at the end which pays no heed to what a plane would actually do when hitting the water, which WOULD have been far more dramatic a conclusion, if they just paid attention to physics. It was actually hilarious.\nI think the scariest bit had to be the speech at the beginning of the film by Harrison Ford. I've heard it before somewhere....\nDon't waste your time, money, patience, eyesight, hearing or mind on this huge waste of finances.

That aside, \"Air Force One\" poses the (then) unlikely premise of a terrorist group commandeering the First Plane (maybe not so unlikely now) and how Harrison Ford, as a strict anti-terrorist commander-in-chief, has to abort the plot while saving not only himself but the First Family. Ford, one of the acting business' most professional artists, is absolutely believeable as both the most powerful man in the Free World and a family man, often struggling not to let the lines of both intersect. The multi-talented Gary Oldman (Francis Ford Coppola's \"Dracula,\" \"The Contender\") is in his element as the thoroughly and dastardly evil leader of the terrorist group, and the incomparable Glenn Close is riveting as the loyal Vice President who refuses to grab the reigns of power as long as her president stays alive. But Close's bigger contribution is her unparalled ability to convey her character's sense of subdued panic while maintaining calm as an uncertain nation looks on. Director Wolfgang Petersen (\"Das Boot\") has come up with a terrific nail-biter despite a couple of stretches of imagination. And, as for Ford's role as president, even Indiana Jones would have his hands full with the guy.

Wolfgang Peterson creates a heavy feeling of tension, Ford a likeable hero and Oldman as Korshunov, a rotten villain who was actually quite scary. The film is also very well put together technically. The editing and sound is top-notch, though some of the CGI is way below par for your average blockbuster. The R-rating helps. If this were made today it would be PG-13 garbage, but the blood spatters, swearing and body count make you believe that ANY character could die next.\n\nBut there are flaws. And one BIG flaw. Some of the dialogue really sucks. And Wendy Crewson has a pretty bad role as the First Lady. The only reason her character is even in it is because the President needs to have a First Lady. Her role is totally useless. I predicted her EVERY line of dialogue before she even said it. I am not kidding. Even Oldman at one point tells her to `SHUT UP!' echoing the feeling of every viewer.\n\nIf you can overlook this minor, although highly irritating, glitch you will totally enjoy a high-octane action film with many, increasingly exciting, set-pieces.

You can chalk this one up as another success for superstar Harrison Ford and director Wolfgang Peterson, who's consistently been one of the better action filmmakers around.\nFord stars as James Marshall, the president of the United States. He and his cabinet have just recently made the crucial decision to go after a renegade general named Radek, who threatens to bring back a state of communism to Russia. The mission to capture him is a success, but not long after Marshall and his family board Air Force One on a flight back to the U.S., Russian terrorists posing as newsreporters take over the flight, complete with machine guns and heavy weaponry. Their demands: to have Radek released or else a hostage (50 total) will be executed every half-hour. You can guess where things go from there, as Marshall remains hidden in the cargo area, ready to take back the plane and save his family.\nDespite an occasionally ridiculous story and quite a few implausibilities, Air Force One never fails to work as a nail-biting actioner. The suspense is palpable, thanks to likeable characters and hissable villains.  There's also the sense of iminent danger and gutsy unpredictability that director Peterson infuses the film with. Hostages are killed every half-hour, and perhaps even those you expect to live through the situation are killed off pretty quickly; the terrorists are not the slightest bit unflinching or unwavering, making for effective villains.\nI've heard a lot of complaints about the seemingly never-ending conclusion, but for me, it just made the film that much more an unpredictable roller coaster ride, with one edge-of-the-seat situation after another. The action sequences are the \"requisite\" shootouts and fistfights, but are truly exciting, and the fact that this is all set on board the world's most famous aircraft adds frantic urgency to the proceedings. There are also a lot of fantastic stunts, the most thrilling one featuring Ford dangling in mid-air, being reeled inside an aircraft with a cable and strap.\nHarrison Ford has one of the most commanding presences of any Hollywood actor, and Air Force One is almost entirely his show. Yeah, James Marshall may be too damn perfect for a politician, but this is a red-blooded action flick, and I want a hero that I can unabashedly cheer for from beginning to end, and Marshall is just that kind of guy. Gary Oldman's the villian, and in true Oldman style, you can expect lots of hollering in a somewhat unintelligible accent (which honestly doesn't sound particularly Russian, as it's meant to).\nJerry Goldsmith's score is excellent, giving the film an additional intensity, and even revving up excitement during the quieter moments. The main theme is a bit overly patriotic, but undeniably rousing.  Hard to say, but this is probably the famed composer's best score since Rudy.\nAside from the logical flaws in the story, the only time the film really stumbles is in the visual effects category. Don't get me wrong, most of the CGI is superb, but there's at least one scene near the end that features probably the most hilariously unconvincing (and disappointing) CGI-rendered shot I've ever seen in a big-studio production.\nAir Force One may be a little silly and implausible, but it's irony-absent presentation is refreshing in a time when just about every other film out there is trying to be as annoyingly sarcastic as possible. In this era of Die-Hard rip-offs, Air Force One is easily one of the best, and for my money, it's more entertaining than the original Die Hard itself.\n**** 1\/2 out of *****","summary":"One of the best action\/thrillers ...","unixReviewTime":1031961600,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

The result is not always plausible, and some of the special effects don't work quite as well as they should, but one cannot fault the film's pace or the tension and excitement inherent in the story.\nEver since playing Han Solo in STAR WARS and Indiana Jones in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, Ford has developed into a leading man of the action genre--the thinking man's action hero.  That aspect blossomed in PATRIOT GAMES, CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, and, especially THE FUGITIVE; and here in AIR FORCE ONE he gets to play the most important man in the world.  He does it with considerable style.  Glenn Close was also a cagey choice to play the first female vice-president, and she does this with incredible fortitude.  William H. Macy and Dean Stockwell are equally fine in supporting roles as part of the President's staff.  And Oldman, whose performance as Oswald in Oliver Stone's JFK was a miracle performance, is equally superlative as the villain, matching the Bruce Willis\/Alan Rickman pairing in DIE HARD.\nPetersen's direction, despite some missteps, never allowed the film to sag; and Jerry Goldsmith's music score is appropriately patriotic without being sickeningly so, and always suspense-building.  This is a film well worth watching.  Don't miss it, especially if you're a fan of such situational thrillers.","summary":"Not Unflawed, But Still Superior To Most Action Films","unixReviewTime":1027296000,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

Some make it out okay with just the bio-pics, other played it safe and just make theirs a concert movie, but \"Spice World\" took a completely alternate step.  It's a Spice Girls power hour where a lot of zany antics occur, and nothing makes sense.\n\nI might be completely biased with this movie, because much like my unholy memories with Tom Green, the Spice Girls were also a devistating memory of youth; the thing is I used to like Tom Green while I was strongly indifferent with the girl band.  But for most of my middle school years, I'm surround by many fangirls in support of this group who play their music loudly and constantly, and I had to be the butt of a ongoing ridicule just because I made a simple comment that Ginger Spice was cute (and Geri Haliwell still looks pretty good).  My adolescent years was damaged because of the band, so reopening this mental wound does lead to personal spite.\n\nBut there are objective things to legitimately castrate this movie.  The biggest problem with the movie is that it's aimless.  The Spice Girls were setting up for a concert, they had a convenient pregnant best friend to chat with, their agent was pushing them to work hard and not have fun, and a tabloit journalist hired a sleazy paparazzo to tarnish the band because he's bored.  Everything else is practically plotless, just random scenarios that segue into other random scenarios.  They sing in different places, they meet celebrity cameos, they go on a photo shoot, two American studio execs are pitching a Spice Girls movie out of the blue, they ride on sport boats with their contest-winning fangirls, they were in a military dance camp with a stern gestappo instructor, and they were discovered by an alien race who loved their music.  There's no connection with each of these scenarios, the randomness of the goofball situations is akin to \"Family Guy\".  It also means these situations are practically idiotic in direction, if not just wordy whenever the girls just run their months about stuff only pre-teens would get into.\n\nJust to hide the fact that the Spice Girls have no acting talent, the rest of the actors have to be completely bonkers. Their agent acts like if Ari Gold popped some speed and drank a pack of red bull, the tabloit guy is pontifically British, and the studio execs are so desperately perverse when they pitch the worst ideas ever in a film, almost like a parallel to this film; the execs even ripped-off an idea from a show pilot in \"Pulp Fiction\" (Spice Force Five, get it?). Neither of them are funny, they're just pretentious, much like the movie's gags.\n\nAgain, I'm being biased.  I am not the film's audience, the audience are young impressionable girls who loved the band's songs.  This movie understood its intended audience, that's why the Spice Girls went on an S&M club, they let their pregnant friend drink alcohol, they wear revealing outfits, an alien nearly copped a feel on Scary Spice, and their agent threatened to hang himself live in concert if the band didn't show up.  But seriously, the audience for this movie is limited at this point.  It wasn't long after the movie's release that Ginger Spice followed her own independent example and left the band, which cause the foundation to crumble and the fans had to move on.  I could say the Spice Girls are gone for good (and no, I'm not counting their world tour stunt a few years back that lasted only a week), but something life has a funny way of turning things around.  If New Kids on the Block manage to get together&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/and-release-an-album-not-too-long-ago\/dp\/B001LN2W38\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">and release an album not too long ago<\/a>, it's possible that this girl group would rekindle their friendship.

The picture and sound will blow you away.  The sound especially if you have a 5.1 surround system.  The gun fire is especially intense and well spaced in the the sound field.

What a crash scene!\nBut another thing I'd like to point out is that it's strange now that all these films that have to do with terrorists have an all new meaning and message now in our post-9\/11 world.  If you'll recall, Oldman's character was a Russian nationalist who wanted a re-united Russian motherland with the President (played by Jurgen Prochnow, of Das Boot fame) of Kazakstan as the Russian Prime Minister.  Except that he's a renegade that wants to use the old Russian nuclear stockpile to terrorize the free world.  Oldman states how US foreign policy may be beneficial to the US, but it destroys the lives of other countries.  I think he mentions something about the sanctions on Iraq causing undue suffering.  So you see, these old terrorist movies should have been a bit of a wake-up call for us.\nSo in closing, if you're looking for a good terrorist thriller in this post-9\/11 world, look no further than Air Force One on Superbit.","summary":"Air Force One on Superbit","unixReviewTime":1018656000,"vote":null,"image":null}

But hey, it's good classic fun, with lots of British celebrity cameos, and bad acting (from all the Spice Girls but especially from Victoria), but it provides a few laughs.\n\nThe story is quite complicated, cos it seems to jump around quite a bit, and is extremely jumbled.

I wasn't broken hearted when they 'broke up', and followed Geri when she went solo, but they were still good poppy songs, and I had all their albums. I think I still do. This was done before Geri went skinny, blonder, and didn't want to be known as a former Spice Girl. Mel B was still loud & brash, Victoria was in the early beginnings of her romance with a certain footballer, before she would take over the world (it seems that way), and Emma & Mel C seemed to have stayed remarkably the same.\n\nThere's a whole host of famous British faces in this. Gary Glitter was supposed to have a cameo, but that was quickly cut from the film when he was arrested. (But they kept in the song \"Do You Want To Be In My Gang?\") Other famous faces are Michael Barrymore, Meatloaf, Elvis Costello, Alan Cumming, Neil Fox (in voice only thank God), Stephen Fry, Bob Geldof, Richard E Grant, Jools Holland, Bob Hoskins, Elton John, Hugh Laurie, Roger Moore, Naoko Mori (now in Torchwood), Richard O'Brien, Jonathan Ross, Jennifer Saunders ...

The commentary by Wolfgand Peterson reveals many interesting facts about the film including the professionalism of Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman.\nMy only complaint is about two sequences involving Air Force One - this is a personal thing. I hate action or stunt scenes which stretch credibility. The first scene, when Air Force One has just landed but the hijackers take off again is a little bit unbelievable. The second scene, at the end, is not only ridiculous and laughable, it is a very poor effect - looking as if the budget has just run out. Ironically, Wolfgang Peterson states that a lot of money was spent on this and he was impressed.\nStill, if you enjoy a good action film which is also an edge-of-the-seat thriller, this is a good choice.","summary":"Mr Kick-[butt]...

It's a little far stretched, but who says it can't be?. Director Wolfgang Petersen delivers a top notch, high octane action film that will definitley please any action film fan. Harrison Ford stars as the President Of The United States whose plane, Air Force One, is taken over in mid-air by russian terrorists. The always excellent Gary Oldman plays the lead villain, and he does it with complete scene stealing bravado. Glenn Close co-stars as the Vice President who tries to communicate with Oldman from Washington D.C. headquarters. We've seen this before, but this is a million times better than most action films that involve hostages and planes. The action is pretty high once it gets going, and the violence is all over the place. Ford is, once again, cinema's leading hero. He can be a space pirate, adventurous professor, or the President. He can make it work every time. Even if the script doesn't always hold up to his excellence. This is one of those. If you realize that this is just pure 100% adrenaline fun, then you will have a grand time watching this fun ride.

Essentially a ripoff of The Beatles \"A Hard Days Night\", the Spice Girls are unfortunately not nearly as famous and their music not nearly as universally recognized. A slew of cameos and familiar supporting cast members can't save the film from its own bad dialogue, poor choreography and painful lip-syncing. Apparently everyone was in it for the paycheck.\n\nPiers Cuthbertson-Smyth (Alan Cumming) is a documentarian desperately trying to obtain footage for his latest project, a look at the popular five-girl singing group The Spice Girls: Ginger (Geri Halliwell), Baby (Emma Bunton), Posh (Victoria Beckham), Sporty (Melanie Chisholm) and Scary (Melanie Brown). While he struggles to sneak into parties and onto sets where they practice, the girls themselves prepare for a big stage show in England. Meanwhile, their eccentric manager is in cahoots with Chief (Roger Moore) the man who feels he is responsible for their success and can take it away with a snap of his fingers, or a caress of his squealing bovine. And if that isn't enough, a mysterious paparazzi spy gets carried away snapping pictures of the fivesome and pasting it all over the headlines. To top it all off, a pair of filmmakers pitch their idea of a Spice Girl movie to studio executives, which as it turns out, is basically the very movie we're watching.\n\nSince the story of the film is largely pointless, and little else really holds attention spans, it is easy to pick out inaccuracies and bits of concepts that don't quite add up. For starters, the girls drive around in the Spice Bus, a blue and red monstrosity that has an impossibly large interior. So impossibly large in fact, that it doesn't even pretend to make sense. Workout equipment, couches, beds and all sorts of other furniture are scattered throughout the inside of the bus, in shots that are clearly not capable of being inside the bus. And yet the filmmakers go so far as to show the flashing lights of other vehicles zipping by the bus windows, even though the realism has long since been abandoned.\n\nWhile each Spice Girl physically embodies stereotypical fashions, physiques and attitudes, those characteristics don't translate over to their personalities. Either they were all scripted to be ditzy, or they're just naturally that way. Through constant daydream sequences they act out various scenarios, most of which are intended as comedy relief, despite the blatant absence of humor. Similarly, the dance and song segments arise from nonsensical situations, and they're choreographed with little self-respect, and with obnoxious elements such as an Army dance instructor and poor lip-syncing. Alan Cumming plays a character very much like we envision him to be in his everyday life, and Roger Moore embarrassingly plays a villain who strokes various furry animals and speaks in riddles, an obvious farce of his own James Bond evildoers.\n\nWith brief appearances by Elton John, Bob Hoskins and other well-known Brits, a wholeheartedly unexciting speedboat adventure, and countless attempts at failed humor, Spice World is still unable to create entertainment that reaches beyond diehard fans of the all-girl group. And even entertaining those fans is debatable. When the group revives an unconscious sick kid by suggesting that Ginger Spice take her top off, it's apparent that their true talents are not in the music.\n\n- Mike Massie","summary":"Spice World Movie Review","unixReviewTime":1196208000,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

To be fair, the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is.  Rather, they are appealing and prove to be the film's lone redeeming factor.  The fault lies in the script that tries to do for the Spice Girls what \"A Hard Days' Night\" did for the Beatles.  Whereas the Fab Four's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on Beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it's trying to say about the Spice craze.

As with David Lean's DOCTOR ZHIVAGO it is about a few years in the turbulent life of the all-female Anglo-Soviet assembly. The Spy and Spice Girls have plenty of character, and that helps make up for the lack of action and adventure that keeps their movie debut from being a truly epic motion picture. The concert scene at Albert Hall in London was very reminiscent of Hitchcock's THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH. It was kind of a 90's version on some of his themes as well as David Lean's and those of the Bond producers. However, it has a potential of being cult epic like AUSTIN POWERS. Perhaps not.

Well, this does the trick. A lot of folks complained about the supposed unrealistic nature of this film, but I think we know now that it isn't as unrealistic as we would have hoped. As far as this movie goes, it is a thrill ride that is sort of like Die Hard on Air Force One, with the president playing the John McClane character in place of Mr. Willis. The terrorists are complex in their rationale, but ultimately, like all terrorists, they are evil at heart. Frankly, it's a bit unnerving to watch it all happening on the screen. But unrealistic is not the word to use any more. Sure, parts of it strain credulity, but so does virtually every action adventure film (automatic weapons fire never seems to actually hit the good guys in Rambo, or Mr. Schwarzenneger, or Mr. Willis, for example).\nIn fact, I was sold on this movie mainly by the performance of Ford, who does an absolutely Oscar-caliber portrayal of the kind of president we all imagine in our dreams. He brings a believability and an integrity to every character he plays, whether it be as president, Han Solo or Indiana Jones.\nThis ultimately isn't exactly deep, and it is somewhat derivative, but it's still a great action flick.

He made The Boat, In the Line of Fire and numerous other classics. Well, is Air Force One really as good as his older movies? No, the answer is no. But it's not as far off as you may have heard. Air Force One is awesome entertainment, and although it has its share of flaws in the script, you probably won't even notice because you'll be too enthralled with the high-flying adventure.\nThe President of the USA (Harrison Ford) goes to Moscow and gives a stirring speech outlining the USA's new \"Zero-tolerance\" policy with respect to terrorism. On the flight home, terrorists actually take over Air Force One (the President's official plane) and take the passengers (including his wife and daughter) hostage. The terrorists plan to execute one hostage every half-hour unless\/until their demands are met. However, the President is a former Medal of Honour winner, so the terrorists may be in for a surprise...\nWe are certainly in for tonnes of surprises. The action is blasting and will grab you when you least expect it and the visual effects are a treat to the eye. The story is weak, but the action delivers plenty of goods and it the films makes darn sure that you and your head won't be turning away from the screen to go to sleep. Harrison Ford is good, but, surprisingly, it's Glenn Close who plays Vice President Kathryn Bennett that really steals the show. Sure, Harrison takes all the action, but Glenn is more powerful. The cheesy lines such as \"Get off my plane!\" and some silly sequences don't do the film any good. But, it's got plenty of eye-candy and goodness about it with the thrills and most of the performances, so don't worry too much.\nAir Force One has some small flaws, but it is still cracking entertainment with a good plot and breathtaking visual effects.","summary":"Cracking entertainment","unixReviewTime":986688000,"vote":null,"image":null}

But I didn't buy the movie for Ford, the sound, or even the amazing clarity of its visuals.  I really bought Air Force One because of its supporting cast and its \"in your face\" directorial style (Wolfgang Petersen's trademark).  From William H. Macy to Gary Oldman to Glen Close to many others, this movie really shines in its supporting cast (the plane included, who gives a stunning performance, without even a stunt double).  However, an outstanding supporting cast does usually mean that the lead role (or roles) isn't doing his or her job.  I think that's the only area where this movie fails to be convincing.\nDon't think I'm against Harrison Ford or anything.  I believe these kinds of movies make the public feel very patriotic.

They might even be a little embarassed to admit that they like it.  Well, I'm not embarassed to admit that the Spice Girls are one of my guilty pleasures.  Granted, their music may be a little hokey, but they sure are fun to listen to.  In \"Spice World,\" the girls take on a world tour with Bond-esque style.  This movie isn't fantastic, but it is fun enough for the whole family to watch.  It's silly, it's goofy, and, at times, it is brilliant.  You get a feel of what these ladies had to put up with on a daily basis, albeit in a grand and over-the-top style.  There are cameos abound in this flick as well.  The acting isn't that bad and the girls seemed to enjoy making the movie.\nFunny moments abound in this flick, but some of my personal favorites are when the girls first get on their tour bus and they complain about how hot it is.  They say that they could use a fan and, in perfect British comedic style, a young, pre-teen girl comes through the door screaming with glee and then runs back out the door.  The girls sigh with comfortable relief.  Another funny moment is the expensive, special-effects laden tour-bus jumping a draw-bridge with Posh behind the wheel scene.  Finally, in the end credits, the girls \"interact\" with the audience. They remark on people making out, wonder why folks watching their video can't find anything good on the \"telly\" and audience member clothes.  The entire movie is just a fun little trip.\nAlan Cumming(X-Men 2, Josey and the Pussycats) takes a turn as a reporter attempting to document the lives of these ladies.  George Wendt(Norm, of 'Cheers' fame)is a movie producer looking for a film to put the girls in and cash in on their fame.  Meatloaf is the bus driver for the girls.  Some of the better-known cameos that American audiences will recognize are Elton John, Bob Hoskins and Roger Moore.  If you're a die-hard fan of British film and television, you'll recognize many of the other cameos as well.\nThe only reason I'm giving this movie three stars is because,obviously, this movie isn't for everyone.  In fact, many people might think that this movie is just too silly to watch.  On my personal scale, I would give this flick four stars for the simple fact that I love to watch it and because the Spice Girls don't take themselves too seriously in the movie.\nOverall, this is a silly, blatantly cheesy movie that lets you laugh at and with the Spice Girls.  They poke fun at themselves and have a good time doing it.  A good movie to watch when you have a little time to kill or just want to forget about the world(but not the 'Spice World') for awhile.","summary":"One Of My Guiltiest Pleasures","unixReviewTime":1077148800,"vote":17.0,"image":null}

Also, it's kind of interesting that the evil Secret Service agent tries to kill Harrison Ford at the end, even though none of the other villains are left to expose him and he could walk away without ever being suspected.  There was some scene that actually explained WHY that guy was betraying the president, but thanks to some boneheaded editing it was cut out of the movie and that character was reduced to just another stock villain.  In addition, almost all of the action sequences are sick mockeries of reality.  Granted, I can sort of go along with having that much random automatic gunfire on an airplane without losing cabin pressure.  But it's just ridiculous when the characters stand next to a big open hatch without getting sucked out into the sky and their hair just blows in the wind like they're standing in front of a movie studio fan.  And the most unintentionally funny moment has to be when the plane crashes-- the whole shot, one of the most awful CG effects I've seen in a big studio movie, is pathetic and kind of sad.  I don't understand why this film has been so successful and popular, especially since we've all seen MUCH better action movies from directors like James Cameron and John McTiernan.  Cameron could make a better movie than this standing on his head.

Soon, the camera crew is revealed as being a group of terrorists  who begin killing at random and hold the remaining survivors hostage in  return for the release of their leader. Ford makes the president a true  hero as he tries to stop the plane and the terrorists, and the story never  stops moving as things unfold. However, the special effects are not  believable in all places, and while the majority of the shots look honestly  true, there is always something to give away the computer wizardry.

I was only 11. I'm 16 now, and I still like to watch this film from time to time. I still have a laugh at some of the scenes, and I've seen it so many times I can recite the lines along with the girls!\nI look at the bad reviews of the movie, and wonder how many people have actually WATCHED the movie? Did they just give it one star because they hate the Spice Girls? I think that was probably the case for most reviewers. Congratulations to the people who gave it 4 or 5 star reviews - you're not ashamed to admit you liked the movie! I also liked it. The Spice Girls may not be popular anymore or what you'd call the latest thing, but they were a fantastic girl band. I bet nearly everyone had at least one song they liked from the girls.\nBut anyway, onto the movie itself. It's damn hilarious! I don't know how so many people didn't think it was funny! I think it's amusing now, and it's been 6 years since it came out in the theatres. The storyline is a bit thin, I have to admit, but the jokes are funny, not cheesy. I especially like the bit where Geri and Mel B are playing chess and Mel B doesn't understand the rules and Geri says she's gonna slap her. Also another funny bit is the part where Victoria says she doesn't know what to wear, and Mel C muses over whether Victoria should wear the \"little Gucci dress, the little Gucci dress OR the little Gucci dress\" as Mel C says. Then Emma chimes in \"I think you should wear the little Gucci dress!\". I like the part near the end where the two movie directors are telling the story to Clifford and everything is happening to the girls.\nThe cheesy parts of the movie include the aliens and the part on the boat. The most dramatic part of the film is the bit where the Spice Girls are having a fight with Clifford and they all storm off.\nThe movie begins with a Top Of The Pops version of \"Too Much\" and ends with a fantastic performance of \"Spice Up Your Life\". The rest of the Spiceworld album is played during the movie.\nMy favourite Spice Girl is Emma, and she had some funny lines during the movie.\nOverall, Spiceworld is a funny movie that doesn't deserve all the negative reviews.","summary":"Very amusing!","unixReviewTime":1060646400,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

Hamlow","reviewText":"When a group that's the real flavour of the moment decides to make a movie, it'll either be a total success or a total flop, depending upon how universally-loved the group is.  The Beatles are hands down the most successful (Hard Day's Night, Help!) due to their immortalized status.  Others have not been so, e.g. Herman's Hermits, Bill Haley.  The Spice Girls kind of fall inbetween the two.\nThe primary influence is probably A Hard Day's Night.  Spiceworld is, after all, a day in the life of the Girls, and includes  musical numbers, an uptight manager, and a triumphant concert number.  Needless to say, it will never stand side-by-side with the Beatles' groundbreaking classic.\nOne credit in their favour is the scene where they parody their own personalities.  Victoria, for example, can't decide whether to wear the black Gucci dress, the black Gucci dress, or the black Gucci dress in her closet.  To which Emma successfully suggests, \"why don't you wear the black Gucci dress?\"  Emma's baby-like innocence is also parodied.  And Geri's misquote on the Pope is a parody of what John Lennon said about Jesus.\nThey seem to have the most fun trying on different costumes in the \"Saturday Night Divas\" number.  Geri as Marilyn Monroe in The Seven Year Itch and Wonder Woman shines out in particular, as do Mel C. and Geri as Danny and Sandy from Grease, and Victoria as Honey Rider in Dr. No.  But the best is when some of them dress up as each other.\nThere are some subplots along the way, such as a documentary team following the Girls, the Girls' very pregnant friend Nicola who pops up every now and then, and a tabloid publisher who hates the girls so much, he hatches a plot to tarnish their image.  The tensions between the girls and their uptight manager Clifford, and an American film producer (George Wendt of Cheers) who consults Clifford to discuss a movie deal involving the girls.  Their Spice Force Five idea (think Spice Girls as Charlie's Angels) is actually a good segment.\nThere are amusing guest cameos from well-known British actors and singers, such as Richard Briers, Hugh Laurie (Wooster in Jeeves and Wooster), Stephen Fry (Jeeves in J and W), Bob Geldof, Elvis Costello, Elton John, and AbFab's Jennifer Saunders.\nI doubt if Roger Moore would consider this movie as his best performance, but he seems to be enjoying himself as the Girls' behind-the-scenes handler, with some really hideous lines:  \"The drummer without sticks has no backbeat.\"  Richard E. Grant though gets noteworthy mention as Clifford.  The scene of him having a real fit at seeing tabloid headlines bashing the girls is funny, but the girls laugh it off and even make fun of him, which makes him even madder.  Meat Loaf is Dennis, the Girls' loyal bus driver, and there's an in-joke when he's asked to add repairing the bus-toilet to his list of duties.  \"I love those girls.  I'll do anything for them, but I won't do that.\"  Hint:  his last hit single.\nThe performances in this movie may depend upon which Spice Girl is your favourite.  In my case, it's Geri, Emma, and Mel C. in that order, but love or hate the movie, all the Spice Girls are still very charming and lovable.  Songs done in this movie in order:  \"Too Much\", \"Do It\", \"Say You Will Be There\", \"Mama\", \"Denying\", \"Saturday Night Divas\", \"Stop\", \"2 Become 1\", \"Leader Of The Gang\", \"Never Give Up On The Good Times\", \"My Boy Lollipop\", \"Wannabe\", \"Viva Forever\", \"Who Do You Think You Are\", \"Spice Up Your Life\", and \"The Lady Is A Vamp.\"\nHad I reviewed this in the throes of my Spice-induced euphoria of 1998, I would have given this the max.  Time though, has not been so generous, but at least the quintet left behind a movie showing them at their peak.","summary":"Spiceworld loses its flavour five years later","unixReviewTime":1057190400,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

Glenn Close is also very good as the Vice President who  tries to negotiate with the terrorists from Washington. Wolfgang Petersen  does a superb job of directing (Das Boot), (In The Line of Fire).

This is a riveting movie about a terrorist group hijacking the world's most well-known airplane, while the President (played  by Ford) must single-handedly defeat them. From Ford's performance to the  special effects to the music, this is a wonderful film.\nWolfgang  Petersen, the maker of the terrifically gripping \"Das Boat\",  directs here and lends the film a terrific sense of claustrophobia. The  cat-and-mouse game Ford plays with the terrorists will leave the audience  on the edge of their seat. Ford is the idealization of what every American  wants his Chief Executive to be- tough, a man of action, resourceful. The  same way Cary Grant and Humphrey Bogart were film icons of the 1940s and  50s, Ford will come to be remembered as one of the great actors of the 80s  and 90s. His casting could not have been better.\nJerry Goldsmith's music  here is good, but not great (his score for \"U.S. Marshals\" was  better). I wasn't overly thrilled with Gary Oldman's performance as the  leader of the Russian terrorists (a little over-the-top at times) and I  wonder if the Russian nationalist plot hasn't been overdone by Hollywood. I  also didn't buy the climactic final rescue of the President from the  crashing plane.

Gary Oldman is very  effective in his role as a Kazakhstani who is willing to die for his cause  and injected a tremendous amount of energy into the film.\nWhat makes this  movie work is that you get to watch something happen that is improbable and  that is something audiences can't get enough of (example: Independace Day ,  etc). Yes, there are some technical aspects of the story that you need to  be willing to overlook, like terrorists walking  onto Air Force One posing  as journalists (yes, reporters really do fly on the plane, but they are  \"familiar faces\" to the crew).\nSo if you are thinking about  adding this movie to your collection, do it!

Many critics compared this film to \"A Hard Day's Night\" but they are sadly missing the point. \"A Hard Day's Night\" was the last film as that traversed the void from innocence into cynicism. George Harrison's scene with the advertising executive was a forerunner of thing to come as big business learns how to mold the teenage market. \"Spice\" in its entirety is about big business and the teenage market.

Directed by television veteran Bob Spiers (\"Ab Fab\"), the movie  focuses on the girls during a few days in their hectic life, as they  prepare for their big gig at Royal Albet Hall in London.\nThe movie's  camp factor helps in boosting the film's appeal with teenagers and  pop-culture fans, and although the acting is not that great, the film gives  us many hilarious scenarios including a Mission Impossible-based fantasy  called \"Spice Force 5,\" and an enjoyable photo shoot where the  girls imitate major pop icons of the past and themselves.\nThe songs from  the band's first two albums provide the film's soundtrack with a diverse  selection of tunes that keeps the film together. I only wished that  producers released a compilation album of the band's songs that were  remixed for this film (\"Who do You Think You Are\" sounds wicked  in a techno beat).\nThe film's other highlight includes multiple cameo  appearances by such personalities as Sir Elton John, Bob Geldof, Meatloaf,  Bob Hoskins, Roger Moore, George Wendt, and one of the actress from the  \"Ab Fab\" series. All give wonderful comic performances.\nThe  film's worst scene involves the girls' encounter with aliens during a  midnight hike in the woods. Personally, this scene seems out-of-place in  such a film. Richard E. Grant is great as the girls' manager, and the  film's subplot of a tabloid thrasher going after the girls makes it much  more fun to watch.\nReminiscent of a \"Hard Day's Night,\" Spice  World will garner more new fans throughout the year as the film is aired on  television and at midnight-movie festivals.

In the film Richard Gere plays a tough New York cop with a drinking habit, an ex-wife, and a bad rep.  So what happens to him?  Well his good natured partner (you know the one with the with the wife and kids and a good reputation a.k.a has everything to lose) gets murdered when Gere takes a tip from a local hood that a hit is about to go down.  So the film turns into the rouge cop on the revenge trail story.  This will bring him to New Oreans(that whole \"fish-out-of-water\" thing), and to Kim Basinger.  Along the way Gere will encounter lots of bad guys, bullets, cops who don't like him, swamps, crawfish, and cajons(sp?) all to a hip 80's soundtrack.\nThis film was the first pairing of Richard Gere and Kim Basinger together and to it's credit it is better than there second film, Final Analysis.  However there really isn't much going on here.  The plot was as predictable as traffic at five o'clock.  Neither Gere nor Basinger is very good which is Richard Pearce's(the director) fault because they fall in and out of their accents.  I have to say though there is something about Richard Gere that even in his weaker films, like this one, he is still fun to watch.  The same can be said for Basinger who is always delightful on the eyes even when she is hard on the ears.\nThis film has it's momments, but they are pretty sparse.  Maybe Richard and Kim will get it right on the third try since they seem to like doing this type of film together.

He is basically a jerk who only cares about taking REVENGE for his murdered partner. It's NOT about saving a woman from slavery or protecting society from a dangerous murderer\/criminal. And the attraction towards him by Kim Basinger's character is just sad - he slaps her, says nasty rude things that only an abused woman like her would be willing to overlook. Hence I don't want to root for him to get her, he does not deserve it in the slightest. As for the action part of the movie, it's OK but not great. Early on I had to cringe at a glaring faux pas of the film makers - he puts hand-cuffs on his LEFT hand and her RIGHT hand but when they get into a car she is sitting on his right side and yet he is able to drive completely unencumbered! Come on - could've made some effort to make it more realistic! Bottom line - action is ok, acting is not bad (Jeroen Krabbe is great as a villain) but the story itself does not fully engage and falls flat at the end. It's important to have a hero at the core of such a genre - think Lethal Weapon or Die Hard. The main reason we love these characters and are willing to forgive their unconventional methods is because they fight the GOOD fight and check their egos at the door.

There is lots of 'wet' in NO MERCY.\nBy the way, Gere must have been a difficult 'act' to work with because he and Debra Winger were at odds in Officer and a Gentleman, and there was a variety of production problems in Coppola'a \"The Cotton Club\" (as the story goes).  I'd assume Gere had something to do with that too.\nBut,\nall that said, NO MERCY has a great look that begins in a pretty dreary Chicago and the gritty look does not change when locales change..\nGere is the aggressive Chicago cop who goes undercover and discovers somebody wants to hire him for a 'hit' on a no doubt about it ruthless New Orleans 'business' man with the gorgeous blonde, Cajun girl who was basically 'sold' to the 'Narlins scum by her own mother when she was 13.\nGere is always good as the wild card cop and\/or loner type, and he will do just about anything to find the murder witness (Basinger).  Could she be involved more than we know?  Well, the race to the conclusion may be visible from an hour away but the ride is entertaining enough with the attractive leads in good form (Basinger really does do that \"shaking rage, so tired of being pushed around and manipulated fury\" well...).\nI found the ending symbolic of a Western in \"Hell\" showdown.\nYep, not only did director Richard Pearce have his cast and crew playing in lots of water, but they also did an impressive job of playing with fire.\nKeep in mind this was years before the movie Backdraft.\nStreet location footage and the hiding in the swamps of Louisiana footage help NO MERCY remain a credible viewing entertainment.  Some of the hard-boiled dialogue by the police Captain (George Dzundza, for example -- who is good otherwise) is too easy to laugh at:  \"I don't like you I don't wanna' swap spit ...(really?  It comes from out of no where too..) but, basically it's \"go get'tum tiger\".  Legalities have become an afterthought.\nCheck out NO MERCY for the good action, the real good visuals (includes Basinger's tastefully done, see through blouse when wet, of course...).\nJust let some story implausibilities slide by and enjoy the buildup to Gere and Basinger's relationship and, of course, the action finale.\nNo need to overthink this one.

I had to give this 5 stars, because 4 would be too critical for minor defects if any and too critical of minor details in the movie. The only thing I was surprised with, is that Richard Gere dyed his hair brown for the part ? No a \"Mr Jones\" it was not, that was out of part for Richard Gere's parts in movies he takes, but it was great. The Beautiful Kim Basinger showed B+ acting and Richard Gere the Hero.

While Jillette's partner Joe Collins (Gary Basaraba) escorts Duval back to her hotel, Jillette meets with Deveneux, but before Jillette can find out the details of the target in New Orleans, Deveneux is killed.

Jillette arrests Duval for complicity in the murder of his partner and the two of them then find themselves on the run both from Losado and from the local police chief Lieutenant Hall (Bruce McGill).

The film features a great love-to-hate villain, Losado, played by Jeroen Krabb; a notable survival-in-the-swamp sequence wherein Gere & Basinger are handcuffed to eachother; and an action-packed showdown in an old city hotel.\n\nActually, I could do without the hotel showdown, as it comes off too cartooney and contrived (like when one of the villains barges right through a wall with his rifle -- Why sure!), but I suppose it can be accepted on the grounds of Western-like artistic license.\n\nThere's loads of foul language but I found it realistic for these types of individuals in such critical situations. So I didn't mind it too much but my wife took (minor) offense.\n\nGere's still relatively young here (36). I realize many hate him, but I'm a fan of quite a few of his pictures, e.g. \"The Mothman Prophecies\", \"King David\" and \"An Officer and a Gentleman\". Kim Basinger doesn't do much for me personally, although she's certainly pretty and her acting is effective here. I know it's a matter of taste but \"No Mercy\" provides zero 'babe appeal' for me.\n\nThe film was shot in Chicago and Louisiana (and some parts in NC).\n\nThe score is moving despite the dated mid-80s electronic drums.\n\nFINAL WORD: It's hard to put into words why I like this film to the extent of writing a review. It's nothing exceptional, but it somehow 'works' and gets better with repeat viewings. I bought the dvd a year & a half ago and have watched it three times since, which is something I rarely (if ever) do. I think what attracts me is that it's more than just a mindless cop\/action flick, although it has the thrills if that's all you're looking for. \"No Mercy\" has something to say about love, loyalty, courage, justice, freedom and happiness, but it's smart enough to not spell it all out. Hence, not only is the picture enjoyable to watch due to the 'movie  magic' but it can also leave you contemplating.\n\nThe film runs 106 minutes.\n\nGRADE: B","summary":"Worthwhile crime\/thriller","unixReviewTime":1286236800,"vote":null,"image":null}

The result is that both the guy and Jillette's partner wind up very dead, while a stunning blonde in on the setup disappears. He heads south to settle the score and soon finds himself being hunted, with the girl in tow and the local police anything but happy. Gere and Kim Basinger go very well together, and the chemistry between them adds to the movie's realism. \"No Mercy\" in my view  is one of the better thrillers of the eighties. The action sequences, especially the final shootout in the burning flophouse, are effective enough to satisfy action movie junkies, but there is more to the movie than that. It is well acted, well photographed and well written, in all a superior sort of thriller.","summary":"No Mercy","unixReviewTime":1267574400,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

Honestly, Criterion is the best of all of them...Criterion, Twilight, Shout! Factory and Scream! Factory.\n\nThis is FAR FAR from a blu ray. I still own the DVD release and will continue to do so. There is absolutely NO difference between the blu ray and the Columbia DVD both in video and audio. I mean NONE. In fact, the blu ray is darker in tone then is the DVD. The darker tone does not account for a richer deeper picture, it is just dark. The DVD has a much brighter picture and the color at times appears sharper.\n\nPerhaps there is a reason why Columbia never issued this as a blu ray.

The comedy lines that play well on stage sound forced and badly delivered in a movie and it's like they are trying to make the first part of the movie all comedy lines.  The badly done comedy scenes are spaced here and there throughout the movie.  I think it's just badly directed because some of the comedy lines are really funny but they sound so forced and artificial that you just cringe.  The drama scenes are for the most part very well done and well acted.  It's a good story with a lot of very good characters.  I found the forced southern accents badly done.

It manages to mix humor with sadness in the best possible way. Aside from that, I think it has a perfect cast. Sally Field as the lead, the mother who worries about her diabetic daughter, Julia Roberts as her diabetic daughter, Dolly Parton as the lovable town beautician, Shirley MacLaine as the town grouch, Olympia Dukakis as the fun-loving ex-first lady of the town, and Daryl Hannah as the new girl in town. I can't get over how well I think this cast does together. They do perfectly together at making their friendship seem believable, and long-lasting. Steel Magnolias is a very watchable movie even to this day, and offers more than a mere ''chick flick'' viewing. Along with Fried Green Tomatoes, Thelma & Louise, and Beaches I think this movie is undeniably classic!","summary":"Humor and Death, Southern style","unixReviewTime":1452902400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Initially, it begins on a happy note by showing Peter Fonda and Dennis Hooper traveling across America on their motorcycles. There's a feeling of euphoria and freedom as we see beautiful landscapes and people waving to them. They pick up travelers along the way, visit a commune, swim in lakes, camp, and smoke pot. Ahhh, what a life of adventure.\n\nHowever, events take a darker turn through intolerance. They just aren't welcome because they have long hair and are unshaven. Jack Nicholson, who plays an alcoholic civil rights lawyer, observes that it's fear and, maybe, jealousy of their free lifestyle. Nicholson gives a good performance and isn't the caricature that he later became. Eventually, the two bikers experience a bad acid trip and, finally, a senseless shooting.\n\nI enjoyed Peter Fonda's performance. He conveys a lot of compassion with only a few lines here and there.\n\nThe story is on the thin side with nice 60's music.","summary":"A Sad Movie and Not What I Expected","unixReviewTime":1491177600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Attempts to \"open up\" the story by leaving the beauty parlor set which was the location of the play and adding male characters only dilute the material.  The most egregious mistake is showing the death of one of the characters, rather than allowing us to experience it though the originally powerful final monologue of another character.  This makes that monologue (significantly cut) anticlimactic.  A tacked-on feel good \"the cycle of life continues\" coda  only makes the petering out of energy more pronounced.  Performances range from good (Sally Field) to phoned in (Olympia Dukakis) to perfectly dreadful (Shirley McLaine).

I have a collection that numbers more than 5,000 in my collection going back to the silent film days, and I have served as a film reviewer in several publications, so I feel qualified to offer my insights about this wonderful ensemble film based on the Herbert Ross film production of the Robert Harling play.\n\nOne must first understand that Steel Magnolias was the first film director Herbert Ross did following the death of his first wife, Nora Kaye, in 1987. He said in an interview that Nora was an exceptionally strong woman just like the women in Harling's play and screenplay and he felt that he could pay her no better tribute than to make Steel Magnolias the best film of his long and illustrious career in her honor. When Ross passed away in 2001 we lost perhaps one of the greatest directors of his generation. Steel Magnolias was nominated for three Academy Awards (unfortunately, a split vote between Shirley MacLaine and Julia Roberts robbed both of them a Best Supporting Actress Award), two Golden Globes (of which Julia Roberts won one for Best Support Actress over Sally Fields), A Chicago Film Critic's Award nomination for Shirley MacLaine (which she did not win), A People's Choice Award for Steel Magnolias as Best Dramatic Motion Picture (which it did win), and finally a BAFTA nomination for Best Supporting Actress for Shirley MacLaine (which she did not win). A handy tally of success to say the least. Steel Magnolias was the 5th from last movie Herbert Ross would direct before he passed away of heart failure.\n\nIf you're an \"Easter-egg hunter\" (quite literally in this instance), look for the playwright, Robert Harling himself, playing the part of  the minister at the Easter festivities (both at the beginning and end of the film), the \"Ouiser never did a religious thing in her life,\" joke in the church, and at the funeral. I won't go into too much detail with spoilers.\n\nMany people love to rehash Steel Magnolias for the script, this actress or that actress, but the truth is that Steel Magnolias was one of those films that was just plain spontaneous combustion. It was the right screenplay, with the right director, one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled (that includes Tom Skerritt and Sam Shepard--who's a damned good playwright in his own right in addition to being a world class actor--put he and Dolly Parton together and it's pure magic!) and the enticing cinematography of the beautiful area surrounding the true backdrop of Robert Harling's original story, Natchitoches, Louisiana. About 6 years ago I was driving through the area and stopped to see if Natchitoches was as beautiful as it was in the movie and I can tell you it isn't. It's even more gorgeous than you see in the film! It's warm and caring community of people who were just as changed by Robert Harling's play and screenplay as some of you were! I strongly suggest you drop by, kick your feet up and stay awhile!\n\nThe one scene I will center on without too much spoiler alerts (turn your head! Turn your head!) is the funeral sequence. I've been known to write a story or two in my days and every time I see Steel Magnolias, the funeral sequence always impacts me emotionally, and I wish I could write half as well as this scene plays out.\n\nEven though I know exactly what's going to happen (who am I fooling? I have the script memorized and mouth the words without making a sound!), I have NEVER had a movie, play or event in my life that takes me from one emotion and slams gears into the reverse direction so abruptly that you have NO choice but to react to both emotions you're feeling at the same time! In this case you can credit Sally Fields, Daryl Hannah (who does a sort of dorky blonde Jesus freak), and Olympia Dukakis grabbing the gear-shift on everyone's emotion by using Shirley MacLaine's grumpy Ouiser  character. If you've never seen it then I suggest you get your popcorn or snack ahead of time and take the phone off the hook. You really don't want anything to interrupt the dramatic rhythm of this sequence.\n\nIf you want to know what my biggest problem with this movie; it's the ending. Everything about my writing skills says it was a beautiful ending, but emotionally, I have this feeling deep inside my heart that I wish I could find out what happens to everyone.","summary":"One of my Top 20 Movies of All Time","unixReviewTime":1434240000,"vote":null,"image":null}

All the actresses in this movie are very familiar to me and they play their part magnificantly.

I still cannot fathom Sally Field with a sourthern accent but she does make her role believable. There is a surprise ending although it is very sad in its own way. Olympia Dukakis is exceptional in that she tries to make others laugh in a sad situation. Either way, the plot indicates that us females can and will support each other in times of every tough crisis possible. The actual author who made the play that this movie is based on also has a sad story in that the play and this movie was based on his sister's illness and ultimate death. He does appear in this movie as the pastor in the beginning of the movie when Shelby is married to Jackson; and again serves as the pastor at the cemetery.

I never really thought about it till after I watched this but not once in my lifetime had I ever actually heard somebody I know say they liked this movie. Now I know why.\n\nI already know what all the fans of the movie would say to me. How they don't even want to waste their breath on somebody as ignorant as me or I had to be alive during the times. Well that argument isn't going to hold any water with me. I admit my favorite genre is science fiction but one of my favorite genre's is also drive-in movies of the 50's, 60's and 70's to which this movie belongs along with many Roger Corman movies.  I don't know how much I can say that hasn't already been said both by lovers of the movie and critics. I don't know what the movie critics were thinking. There is no way that today a movie like this would garner positive reviews. Not with the internet being what it is. I suppose many movie critics of the time were part of the hippie generation and were liberal minded. Even so, I don't know how you can possibly think this was a good movie.\n\nAfter the first 5 minutes it was all downhill from there. There is nothing exceptional about this movie. I've seen much better biker movies or better movies of any genre you want to classify this as. The direction is poor. There is a reason nobody would give Dennis Hopper a job for a long time after this. His next movie was a bomb and I think Hollywood realized he just go lucky with the reviews. The editing is poor also. There are several inconsisticies. The acting is well below average also. Not to mention the 'locals' they used didn't help matters. While I was watching it I said to myself \"I'll bet they just used local people, these people can't act\" and sure enough I learned that's exactly what they did. It ends terribly and I learned nothing other than the hippie movement was a waste of time. There is nothing in this movie that stands the test of time. It appears to be a movie about a bunch of losers who did nothing with their lives. I don't want to make this sound like a political discussion but what good is all this 'freedom' they talk about so for you if you do nothing with it other than to live like an animal. Then again I don't spend my life smoking weed either so I guess I'll never understand.\n\nThe movie is boring, poorly acted, poorly directed, poorly edited, plot starts OK and slowly goes nowhere. In a way it reminded me of 'The Incredible Shrinking Man.' Eventually the main protagonist shrinks to nothingness. Same as this movie.\n\nUnless they find all that lost footage and make this into a better movie, I will never watch it again and consider it a lesson learned. I have no idea what the AFI was thinking when they included this in their 100 greatest movies.\n\nThis opinion is not coming from the younger generation who just want to see action. I actually like slow movies, independent movies....low budget movies in particular. But this one is just ridiculous. I'll admit that movies sometimes seem worse when you have expectations (opposite is true too) but this one is just flat out ridiculously boring and it teaches you nothing despite it's pretentiousness. Just look at Dennis Hopper. Typical from the generation and he is just a burn out. Listen to the commentary on the additional making of feature. They talk about him ranting and raving about the government and how they knew what they were doing when making the movie. He sounds like a raving idiot.\n\nThe only good thing that came out of this was that Jack Nicholson got himself recognized. The only decent actor in the movie.\n\nI couldn't be more disappointed when watching a movie.\n\nRecommended for people who just have to see every movie on AFI's 100 greatest films. There is no other reason to watch this other than to use this movie as an example of the saying, \"opinion's are like ........ everybody has one.\"","summary":"Vastly overrated movie that doesn't stand the test of time","unixReviewTime":1462579200,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

Produced during the decline of the studio system, Easy Rider, directed by Dennis Hopper, was made on a small budget and is today regarded as a cinematic milestone, ushering in the New Hollywood movement.\n\nBikers Wyatt\/Captain America (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper), with money in their pockets from smuggling cocaine across the border, head from Los Angeles to New Orleans to celebrate Mardi Gras. En route, they are temporarily sidetracked by a commune of free spirits and later arrested for parading without a permit. In jail, they meet drunken lawyer George Hanson (Jack Nicholson), who agrees to join them on their road trip.\n\nThe movie is constructed episodically. One scene takes place at a roadside cafe where the trio is denied service. Another depicts a bad LSD trip in a cemetery, and yet another has the three guys smoking pot around a campfire and revealing more of their backgrounds. Though Wyatt and Billy are drug dealers hoping to live a life unanswerable to the establishment, they are portrayed as attractive characters bucking the system and  for a time  getting away with it.\n\nEasy Rider didn't look or sound like any movie made in America up to that point. It was clearly groundbreaking for the film industry, but also had a dramatic effect on society in general, with baby boomers coming of age questioning the values, rules, and policies of the older generation. The movie is still powerful and still resonates as a commentary on a divided America and generational conflict.\n\nBonus features on the Blu-ray Special Edition include two audio commentaries with Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda, two documentaries about the making and history of the film, TV excerpts showing Hopper and Fonda at the Cannes Film Festival, and theatrical trailers.","summary":"Still powerful decades later...","unixReviewTime":1462233600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Men and women wanted to be free spirits to find their own way in life which meant doing drugs, having sex when they wanted and basically being themselves.\n\n \"Easy Rider\" is one of the best buddy films in American cinema. In this case it deals with two bikers, Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper, who drive across the American South West to discover a better life. The film is well acted, well written and is extremely beautiful on Blu Ray as the studi did an amazing job with the transfer.\n\n Jack Nicholson has a small part in the film and the small amount of screen time he has in \"Easy Rider\" shows audiences the kind of actor who would become.\n\n The film was nominated for three well deserved Oscars.","summary":"\"The End of the Great Sixties\"","unixReviewTime":1421971200,"vote":null,"image":null}

It represents the era of counterculture during its year of release. It stars Peter Fonda,Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson.\n\nTossing wristwatches away, two bikers hit the road to find America. After a major cocaine sale to an L.A. connection,free-wheeling potheads Billy,played by Hopper; and Wyatt aka Captain America,played by Peter Fonda,head eastward to party at Mardi Gras before going to Florida with the riches concealed in Wyatt's stars-and-stripes gas tank. As they ride through the Southwest, they take a hitchhiker to a struggling hippie commune before they get thrown in a small-town jail for \"parading without a permit.\" Their cell mate,drunken ACLU lawyer George Hanson, does them a favor by getting them out of jail and then decides to join them. Babbling about Venusians, George discovers the joys of smoking grass, but an encounter with Southern rednecks soon proves how right he is about the danger posed by Billy's and Wyatt's unfettered life in a country that has lost its ideals. With the straight world closing in, Wyatt and Billy try to revel in New Orleans with some LSD and hookers but the acid trip is shot through with morbidity. Once they reach Florida, Billy raves about attaining the American dream; Wyatt, however, knows the truth: \"We blew it.\" He knew that their financial success resulted in a spiritual failure.\n\nEasy Rider represents the feeling of its time about counterculture and the anti-establishment movement. It also reflects the emotions and spirit of its time. I must say that this movie represents what sex,drugs and rock and roll is all about. Great performances were turned in by Fonda,Hopper and Nicholson. Overall,the film is about the times of the Vietnam War era and the spirit of its times.","summary":"A Counterculture Classic","unixReviewTime":1419638400,"vote":null,"image":null}

I guess what nowadays would be called the \"Director's Cut\", or the \"Extended Edition\". Peter Fonda showed this cut to his father, Henry, who liked it, and talked of releasing it after the theatrical version had played out. Back then, that would have meant a theatrical release, in the days before VHS cassettes and DVD's. On the music: CSN&Y's \"Find The Cost of Freedom\", performed acappella on their live album \"Four Way Street\" was originally written by Stephen Stills for the ending of the movie, but Fonda\/Hopper instead used \"Flow River Flow\", written by Roger (nee Jim) McGuinn, and performed by the latest incarnation of The Byrds at the time (1969).\n\nRip Torn was originally cast for the part subsequently played by Jack Nicholson. However, Dennis Hopper got into a huge argument with Rip Torn, and pulled a knife on him (most likely a Buck Folding Hunter). Torn, having been an MP in the Army, quickly \"subdued\" Hopper, and left the production. Opening the door for Jack Nicholson, who Peter Fonda had worked with when acting in some Roger Corman films (such as The Trip, which I'm sure is available from Amazon). And the rest, as they say, for Jack Nicholson's career, is history.\n\nAfter the incredible success of Easy RiderThe Wild Angels, starring Peter Fonda, The Glory Stompers, starring Dennis Hopper, and Hell's Angels on Wheels, starring Jack Nicholson, were packaged and re-released on a triple bill. I'm sure all of those movies are available from Amazon as well.\n\nPS: Maybe all this Easy Rider history is in that booklet accompanying the Duluxe Edition. I do not know, as I've never seen that booklet.","summary":"Easy Rider Trivia","unixReviewTime":1413763200,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

Joseph","reviewText":"I love this tape of the early 'I Dream of Jeannie' shows.  I remembered seeing the series in color during my childhood.  It was in 1981 (when I was a teenager) I discovered the series was originally shot in black-and-white.\n\nIn addition, I heard for the first time - and came to love - the series' ORIGINAL theme score.  Unlike the familiar perky theme heard in the later 'Color' episodes, the score for the black-and-white series is slower, and romantic.  The original theme song is featured on this tape for both episodes, \"The Lady in the Bottle\" and \"My Hero\".  The first season for \"I Dream of Jeannie\" was in 1965.\n\nIn \"The Lady in the Bottle\" pilot, Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut, gets stranded on a South Pacific beach after a space mission he's on suddenly goes wrong, forcing him to make an emergency landing.  He writes S.O.S. in large letters on the sand.\n\nAs he waits for help to arrive, Nelson comes across an unusual-looking bottle lying on the sand.  After unsuccessfully placing it aside (twice, the bottle intentionally rolls at his feet), Nelson takes it up.  He unwittingly rubs it, only to release - to his surprise, a beautiful 2,000 year-old female genie (whom he calls 'Jeannie').  Kneeling and speaking in Persian, Jeannie promises to serve her 'Master' for the rest of his life, and to grant him any wish.  Jeannie seals this promise when she rises, goes over, and tenderly kisses Captain Nelson. Jeannie later helps Tony get rescued; but Tony cannot bring her with him since nobody believes in genies as they don't exist.\n\nJeannie returns to her bottle and sneaks into Tony's kit bag.  She later ends up in his home in Coco Beach, Florida.  Yes, this was how Jeannie and Master came together ...with many loveable, amusing mishaps to follow in future episodes to come!\n\nIn the second episode, \"My Hero\", Jeannie transports Tony back to ancient Baghdad with assorted comic situations.  Captain Nelson, as always, gets the brunt of things happening to him.  In one cute scene in the episode's beginning, Tony, after having breakfast with Jeannie, verbally wishes he could go swimming instead of going to work.  Jeannie immediately grants his wish (with her familiar blink), and Tony ends up plunging into a swimming pool that has suddenly materialized at his feet.  Jeannie laughs as Tony, surfacing, mildly reprimands her.\n\n\"My Hero\" also features a shortened version of the odd couple's romantic meeting on the beach in the opening segment.  A male narrator's voiceover informs the viewers of how the couple met, soon followed by the original romantic 'Jeannie' theme played.  This was the black-and-white episode I saw for the first time in 1981.\n\nAnd for a bit of trivia:  It was in this episode that Barbara Eden was pregnant.  The extensive veil from her headpiece wrapped about her midsection hid her pregnancy.  Eden's first husband would later play the wicked genie - 'The Blue Djinn' - who imprisoned Jeannie in the first color episode of the series.  These facts are from the book \"Dreaming of Jeannie: TV's Primetime in a Bottle\", by Steve Cox -- which I own.\n\nAn interesting detail for \"The Lady In the Bottle\" episode is that the videotape version features English subtitles as Jeannie, upon being released from her bottle, speaks to Captain Nelson in Persian (before Nelson wishes that she could speak in English - which she thankfully does!). However when this episode recently aired again on TVLand, there were no subtitles.\n\nBarbara Eden would re-create her and Captain Nelson's meeting in the 1985 T.V. movie \"I Dream of Jeannie: 15 Years Later\" - minus both Larry Hagman (who, at the time, became mean and greedy J.R. of \"Dallas\"), and without the early 'Jeannie' theme song.\n\nBut the original episode is the way to go.  Get this video gem, instead.  In fact, try to get it as copies of this \"I Dream of Jeannie\" pilot episode are becoming hard-to-find.","summary":"\"The meeting of Jeannie and Master.\"","unixReviewTime":1093737600,"vote":9.0,"image":null}

None of these episodes would really be considered classics, but they are all certainly representative of the show:\n\"The Biggest Star in Hollywood\" (Episode #106) finds Tony heading for Hollywood, so Jeannie prepares a goodbye that shows up in a mirror.  The producers of \"Laugh-In\" are impressed by the trick and just have to have her on the show.  Seeing yet another opportunity to become rich and famous, Roger becomes the manager for the Princess Armena, and promises to have her on the show.  \"Laugh-In\" regulars Arte Johnson, Judy Carne, and Gary Owens appear in this average outing.\n\"Help, Help, a Shark\" (Episode #134) features Jim Backus as General Fitzhugh, the longtime rival of General Schaeffer (Vinton Hayworth), who are competing for a spot in the All-Military Pool Championships.  When Tony ruins Schaeffer's big game his only chance to avoid being sent to the North Pole is to play Fitzhugh in a rematch.  The good news is that with Jeannie on his side, Tony is sure to win.  The bad news is that Fitzhugh refuses to play with a woman in the room.  Of course a large part of the pleasure here is the guest appearance by Thurston Howell III himself, which makes this the best episode of this particular trio.\n\"My Master the Chili King\" (Episode #139) has Arvel (Gabriel Dell), who is Tony's cousin (twice removed) showing up and convincing Jeannie to invest $1,000 in his great recipe for Texas chili.  She buys his story that Tony has agreed to endorse the product and promptly blinks up cans with his picture on them and gets them on the shelves in every grocery store in the area.  The only problem is that NASA does not let its astronauts endorse products.  A solid outing as far as such things go, the episode also has Dick Van Patten as the clerk at the market.\nAs is usually the case, the big surprise is noting how good of a comic actor Larry Hagman was on this show, before he made his mark as J.R. Ewing on \"Dallas.\"  Just watch how many times he gets to do an over the top reaction to Jeannie's antics in \"Help, Help, a Shark.\"  Just do not look for Barbara Eden's navel, because although it did get seen a couple of times, these are not those episodes.","summary":"Three episodes from near the end of \"I Dream of Jeannie\"","unixReviewTime":1075766400,"vote":7.0,"image":null}

First up is \"Happy Anniversary\" (Episode 31), written by series creator Sidney Sheldon.  This is the opening episode of the show's second season, the first shown in living color, with a new cartoon opening and the familiar theme song.  Jeannie has big plans for enjoying the first anniversary of her bottle being discovered by Tony, who, of course, has forgotten all about it and is due to be sent into orbit.  History repeats itself as Tony crash lands on their island, but this time the bottle holds not Jeanie, but the Blue Djinn (Michael Ansara), the evil genie who imprisoned our heroine two thousand years ago.  Looks like Major Nelson will appreciate Jeannie a lot more after this one.\nIn \"My Master, the Weakling\" (Episode 66), Don Rickles plays physical trainer Commander \"Killer\" Kiski, who decides Tony and Roger (Billy Daily) are weaklings and need to be whipped into shape.  However, Jeannie will only put up for this nonsense for so long before turns the tables on \"Killer\" by giving him the temperament of his sweet old auntie.  Look quick for David Soul as an orderly, years before he went on to fame in \"Starsky & Hutch.\"\nFinally, \"My Son the Genie\" (Episode 74), has Bob Denver visiting the Nelsons as Harold, an apprentice genie who has to spend the day with Jeannie to complete his training.  The problem is that the President of the United States is coming to dinner to congratulate Tony on his latest trip into space and Harold insists on making the dinner.  Wackiness ensues, as you would expect with any sit com on which Bob Denver appears.  For fans of Jeannie this is one of the better tapes available.","summary":"Jeannie and her Master versus Gilligan and the President","unixReviewTime":1012608000,"vote":28.0,"image":null}

The stars of the show remain the motorcycles (which  in this case, also served as vehicles of rebellion, escape, and non-conformity).\n\nThe Easy Rider bikes were super cool.  Peter Fonda in Easy Rider remains super cool.  And the film still captures my imagination.

It is supposed to be one of those \"southern themed\" shows of the late 80s\/90s that was pretty persistent in American culture then for whatever reason. Anyway, it was almost as if this movie tried to make being southern \"hip\"\/\"cool\". They were portrayed as foul, immoral, eccentric air heads. Dunno. Maybe there was still some of the typical US socio-economic put down in there. Who knows? Anyway, the movie is over the top with this drama and sensationalism. I mean I have known people with diabetes before. Some who died from it as they had a horrific life with it--uncontrollable. But I have never seen any take a fit smacking at their new hair do like the Roberts character did. Just goofy. Kinda laugh out loud. Anyway, the one \"Christian\" in the movie was of course just an \"embarrassment annoyance\" designed to frame such people as such. We of course get to see Sally Field cry AGAIN. We get to see the tear jerking moment of when a husband signs away his wife's life by consenting to have her \"unplugged\"--we humans sure do have such hard choices in life don't we--at least according to liberals.","summary":"just silliness","unixReviewTime":1423612800,"vote":null,"image":null}

I did see when it first came out. It was the movie to see if you were of a certain age. But I didn't like it much then, and I feel about the same now. However, I did like the scenes of the American southwest as it is my favorite place to vacation. But the central theme of the movie: freedom? Uh, no thanks. Living that kind of life is just as deadening as any traditional way of life you can think of. Constantly getting high and saying \"groovy man\" ? Sorry. And the two main characters, Wyatt and Billy, are actually criminal drug-smugglers. But of course to the geniuses at Rolling Stone and other leftist, counter-culture outlets, they were \"heroes\" who were thumbing their noses at  America and the man. The South really takes it on the chin with the climax of the movie and all the scenes in-between. Jack Nicholson's career was kick-started (ha, ha) by this flick, but his oft-quoted line about people hating Wyatt and Billy because they represented freedom is a crock. Most adults looked at hippies as drug-addled lunatics who were wasting their lives. Which they were. Another myth left over from the sixties is that most kids were hippies like the dolts in the commune. The fact is only a tiny percentage of kids (less than 5%) were hippies. So as an entertaining medium Easy Rider barely satisfies. It's interesting to me for reasons other than being a realistic movie. Which it isn't.  But as far as being a great flick...no way MAAAAAAAAN!!!","summary":"less than what it seems","unixReviewTime":1380240000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Don't watch it for the acting, music or costumes.  Just watch it. It was never meant to be a blockbuster, just a low buck art film. It is not a shining example of any of the casts best work, but it has a deep message and is a window to the era.  I suppose if we were living in that era it's avant-garde message would have stuck us and we would have cheered the performance.  Today, not having lived in that era, and spoiled by modern techno-cinema, I missed a lot, but I did see many comparisons and points that were trying to be exposed.  Compare them to today.

The hippie movement, the increased exposure of recreational drugs, and the idea of freedom were all on the rise. Easy Rider captures that time and tries to depict a feeling. For the most part, it succeeds.\n\nWyatt (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper) star as two bikers who are riding across America on their choppers. We see them buying and selling drugs, and meeting up with other like-minded people. They are determined to leave behind the established system and make their own way in life. In a way, this is a road movie, but it's also much more.\n\nThe biggest source of conflict in the movie comes in the form of people who see Wyatt and Billy as dangerous non-conformists. They are arrested on dubious grounds and receive verbal abuse from some of the townspeople they meet along the way.\n\nThe story itself is actually pretty thin. This is a movie that is more about the lifestyle than the plot of its characters. The idea of communes and free love are not as shocking as when they first appeared, but imagine watching the ideas portrayed in this movie when it was released.\n\nJack Nicholson shows up as lawyer George Hanson, who helps out our rebellious heroes when they find themselves locked up in jail. Nicholson's role is brief, but memorable. Hopper and Fonda do a great job of portraying the free-spirited bikers.\n\nMusic plays a big part in the movie and helps to establish the 60s feel. Be ready for Hendrix, Steppenwolf, The Byrds, The Band, Roger McGuinn, and many other performers from the era. The other star is the American scenery. The mountain locations are particularly spectacular.\n\nThe movie is dated now, but I found it enjoyable nonetheless. I would recommend it for people born in the 50s or before, as well as younger people who are curious about what life might have been like at the end of the 60s.\n\nThe Blu-ray presentation from Criterion (in the America Lost and Found set) does a good job of restoring this important movie, and comes with commentaries and a choice of audio options.\n\nOverall score 3.75\/5","summary":"Dated, but an important film about social change","unixReviewTime":1378598400,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

While I tend to agree with the institute on their picks, I believe the Institute was likely stoned when they rated this film.  I understand the concept of the film: disillusioned anti-establishment pothead youths dropping out to find true freedom and true expression, but the filmatic means used to reach this end go absolutely nowhere.  The director, Dennis Hopper, (also a costar in this monument to the sixties), loads at least a third of the film with mostly meaningless, boring footage of the two cyclists touring through the American west using drug-culture inspired music from the 60's as the soundtrack. Honestly, I could have filmed better footage through my childhood super-8 camera. And with perhaps the exception of one or two songs (Born to Be Wild), the music is dreadfully dated, the lyrics incomprehensible, and incredibly boring.\n\nIt seems Peter Fonda's main role is to look cool, and he does this quite well, but he does little else in the entire film. His emotional range does not register on the Richter scale.  Dennis Hopper's character is one-dimensional as well - we know all about him in the first 15 minutes of the film.  Only Jack Nicholson's character lends any acting credence to the film.  Nicholson shines as the lawyer who seeks the freedom to throw off society's restraints, but even Nicholson cannot save this sinking ship.\n\nThere is a climatic scene at the end of the film when the duo reach New Orleans and celebrate Mardi Gras. They have a LSD drug trip and the camera tries to capture the \"trip\" experience.  Again, the sequence is poorly filmed, poorly edited, and is far too long.  The photographic special effects used are hopelessly antiquated and I am sure high school film students of today could surpass this effort.\n\nAs I compare this film to the great classics: Gone With the Wind, The Graduate, Citizen Kane, Rear Window, To Kill a Mockingbird, Easy Rider truly has no wheels to ride on.  It is not a film for the ages, on the contrary, it is a film for 1969, and it belongs buried in the failed American era that was the sixties.\n\nkone","summary":"Dated Disappointing Riders","unixReviewTime":1361664000,"vote":13.0,"image":null}

It accurately shows what actually happened sometimes when you let your \"freak flag\" fly, in the words of Jimi Hendrix, out there in square America in 1968.\n\nTwo young guys (played by Hopper and Peter Fonda) score a big drug sale, so they head across the country with their cash, towards Florida, on motorcycles, but this is not a biker movie! It's about the hippie attitude, lifestyle, and its backlash.\n\nAlong the way they pick up their alcoholic hitchhiker (Jack Nicholson) who is murdered one night in an attack by country bumpkin locals as the guys were sleeping in the woods. The survivors proceed to New Orleans for Mardi gras as planned, and encounter two hookers (notably Karen Black for one), get mind blowingly high, where Hopper shows outstanding camera work and creativity in this masterpiece. Afterwards, moving on, the boys are fatally hasseled by a couple more rednecks, where the movie ends.\n\nEasy Rider was filmed in many locations in the desert southwest and deep south, and the scenery almost steals the show. Many local folks were hand picked by Hopper to act in this film along the way. The sound track album was a big hit in 1969 as well.\n\nAs a special feature, Dennis Hopper's running commentary on the film brings special insight to one of the finest, most colorful period flicks ever made.","summary":"An American art  film","unixReviewTime":1359936000,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

Along the way they experience gorgeous landscapes, a commune, jail, new friends, unexpected enemies, drugs galore and a whore house when they arrive.\n\nJack Nicholson stands out as one of the friends they meet; while the beautiful Karen black & Toni Basil star as two prostitutes in New Orleans.\n\nWhat makes \"Easy Rider\" great is that it's more than just a road adventure with a modern Western garnish (i.e. cowboys on motorized \"horses\"). The film has depth that separates it from the typical biker flicks of that era. It's really about freedom or the lack thereof. Wyatt and Billy certainly have some grasp of freedom - and they desperately pursue it - but they're ironically so shackled by their OWN carnal desires and growing addictions that the most they attain is a piece of it. Wyatt laments near the end of the film: \"We blew it; we really blew it\" as he realizes freedom has slipped through their fingers like water. Nicholson's character, George, has more of handle on what's going on, but he obviously has his own issues.\n\nThe hippies at the commune seem to have escaped society's shackles but to what end? There's a reason communes never really caught on in America, and the film shows why.\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone in the early 70s Fonda pointed out that Wyatt represented everybody who feels that freedom can be bought, that you can find freedom through other things, like riding motorcycles across the country or smoking pot. He confessed that \"Easy Rider\" is actually about the LACK of freedom in modern Western Civilization. Wyatt and Billy are not right, they're wrong. The only thing the writers (Fonda & Hopper) could do in the end was kill the characters. In a sense, committing self-destruction, which Fonda claimed America was doing. He said viewers often respond to the end by lamenting, \"Look at those terrible rednecks, they killed those two free souls, blah, blah, blah.\" But \"Easy Rider,\" he pointed out, is a Southern term for a whore's man, not a pimp, but the dude who lives with her. He's got the easy ride. And that's what he claims happened to America - liberty's become a whore, and we're all taking the easy ride.\n\nSo what's the answer? The answer's there and it's pretty clear, but don't expect me to hand-feed it to you. Seek and you will find.\n\nIn any event, this might give you some food for thought the next time you catch the\nfilm.\n\nSome modern viewers with ADHD criticize the film as boring, but I find it strangely engrossing from beginning to end. The climax is equal parts sudden, powerful, shocking and unforgettable.\n\nThe film was shot in California, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah (Monument Valley) and Louisiana and runs 95 minutes.\n\nGRADE: A","summary":"Quest for freedom","unixReviewTime":1358380800,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

Hippies and drug use are explored, as well as the general antagonism towards 'long-hairs.' Fonda dresses in a leather jacket with an American flag on the back, while Hopper wears Native American-style buckskin pants and shirts. Fonda is appreciative of others, while Hopper is often hostile and leery of outsiders. Money is provided from the sale of cocaine from Mexico in L.A.\n\nThe two are given some LSD after leaving a commune, and told to share it with 'the right people.' Jokingly riding within a small-town parade, the two are arrested and meet ACLU lawyer\/local drunk Jack Nicholson who helps get them out of jail. Later the trio are beaten at night by locals; Nicholson is killed and the other two suffer minor injuries. The two then make it to Mardi Gras in New Orleans, and later Fonda realizes their 'freedom' isn't that rewarding.\n\nThe movie ends when two other rednecks spot them, decide to 'scare the hell out of them' with a shotgun, and end up killing both after Hopper gives the one the finger.\n\nOverall, the dialogue is minimal, and the acting even worse - except for Nicholson. On the one hand, the movie was totally boring and centers around lifestyles I dislike. On the other hand, it does a fair job of depicting the counter-culture lifestyle. Regardless, Peter Fonda looks as much like a motorcyclist as I look like Mr. T.","summary":"Mixed Feelings -","unixReviewTime":1357862400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Apparently Easy Rider gets its primary kudos, and placement on the AFI top 100 list at spot 88, for being a fully independent movie. It was one of the first to really make inroads in the high-power movie system. Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda pretty much made this movie on their own, funded it, and then filmed themselves riding motorcycles across the US.\n\nThe motorcycles are now iconic, although one has to wonder with their tiny gas tanks just how often the characters would have had to stop for gas on their cross-country trip through some fairly empty wastelands.\n\nMuch of the movie is full of the gorgeous scenery of the United States. Having driven many of these roads myself, I found myself remembering those trips fondly while watching the movie, and wishing I could go back and take those trips again. The beauty of Monument Valley and other locations is brought vividly to life. In many ways it's a celebration of the wild range of landscapes.\n\nThere are also a variety of cultures shown here, which is equally interesting. Yes, we get the hippie commune of \"city-folk\" men and women trying their best to live off the dry, dusty land. We see small-town deep south, where the teen girls are intrigued by the strangers and the men-folk are threatened. There are the prostitutes of New Orleans, the quiet farmer and his family, and more. Everyone has their own view on life and what it means to live.\n\nThis is definitely a \"guy's film\". Nearly all women who appear are nameless and are there to ogle or idolize the men. The only two women who seem to talk more than a word are two are the two prostitutes in New Orleans, who go on a long acid trip with the guys. Most of their \"talk\", though, is wild ramblings due to the drugs.\n\nSome say that this is a 60s ode to the glory of drugs. I don't see that. If anything, it seems to show that their path of freedom didn't lead to joy. One of the characters sighs, near the end, that \"we blew it.\" He praised the farmer who had a wife, a family, and a quiet homestead where he was able to live off the grid. That is praised as being of value. The commune is poked at for being unrealistic - they plant seed into dry sand. The LSD trip, far from being shown as fun and color-filled, is shown as scary and dangerous.\n\nA great movie to see at least once, since there are so many other movies, TV shows, and novels that reference scenes in this and expect watchers to be familiar with what is going on. It's also a powerful glimpse into time, to see the forces that were at work in the US in the late 60s.","summary":"A Classic","unixReviewTime":1338768000,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

Just the bikers in the final scene, especially, left me breathless. I remember leaving the theater feeling depressed because the conflict between the hippy bikers and the rednecks who finally shoot them dead seemed so emblematic of the bigger divide in society then between the straights and the hippies. Of course, I was only 16 then. What did I know? Today, this film plays a little differently. You have to look at it in its own context. Yes, the dialogue is ridiculous. And there is really no plot, to speak of. The soundtrack, which was very cool and original in its day, has, of course, been superceeded many times over by newer films that make more sophisticated use of music. The New Orleans cemetery scene is the weakest section. It was shot out of context from the rest of the film, and was something done first as a way for the filmmakers to try to get some money to make this movie. Dennis Hopper was a Hollywood pariah at the time. No one wanted to work with him because of his crazed drugging and drinking. Jack Nicholson was largely unknown, then a star of many obscure B-movies. Peter Fonda was the big man then, ironic because today he is the most forgotten of the three, never having made much in the way of other hit movies.

Pouliot","reviewText":"Dennis Hopper's recent passing was the final straw in a decades-old interest in seeing this film. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was blown away by this film. We all know the story - a couple of hippie bikers ride out on a west-to-east cross-country tour to retire in Florida after a lucrative drug deal. Along the way, they run into about every permutation of hippie life in the 1960s - commune livers, idealist back-to-earthers, heavy druggers, free-lovers and the like. And they also run into a not-so-nice slice of \"regular\" America as well. Racists, hippy-haters, long-hair loathers, corrupt cops, prostitutes and swamp dwellers round out what passes for normal in the movie's vision of America.\n\nWhat amazed me about the film is that it worked as an insightful allegory of the path of the hippy movement - while the hippy movement was in full swing. The film was shot in early 1968 - before the assassinations of MLK and Bobby, the Chicago riots and the election of Richard Nixon had soured the counterculture. So it was wild to see the film suggest the fatuity of the movement, its self-contradictions (back to Nature + smoke\/drink\/pill-pop your brains out) and its eventual rejection by society at large.\n\nGreat performances by the stars. Peter Fonda was the suave and  mellow side of the youth culture. Decked in a leather jacket emblazoned with an American flag, he was the nave intellectual, trying everything and finding everything to be interesting and acceptable. Dennis Hopper was the movement's unthinking, manic side - just looking for the next high, the next lay, the next thrill. Jack Nicholson was the film's tragic, realistic voice. With one world in the straight world and one in the wild world of Fonda and Hopper, he was able to see dangers that the other two were oblivious to.\n\nThe 35th anniversary edition is one of the very few movies whose \"making of\" segments were worth watching. Using interviews with Fonda, Hopper and others, it tells the story of the disarray of filming the movie and the struggle to get it on screen. Hopper's original cut came in at a mind-bending 3-1\/2 hours long. Luckily, wiser hands wrested editorial control from him and gave us the masterpiece we have now.\n\n\"Easy Rider\" - a great film, a fine period piece and an extraordinary commentary on a lost generation of seekers and dreamers.","summary":"The ride of a lifetime","unixReviewTime":1280275200,"vote":7.0,"image":null}

I agree with him, or at least that is how I have always viewed the film. The subjects of drugs, using and selling, dressing for \"hippie' success, the hard road of rural communal living (or urban communal living, for that matter), and trying to cope with the \"squares\" and \"rednecks\" were all in a day's work back in the days for those of us committed to \"seeking a newer world.\".\n\nIn that sense \"Easy Rider\" is a very, very different road trip from that of the literary one in Jack Kerouac's 1957 \"On The Road\" (although the \"action\" of that book actually took place in the late 1940s). That small generational difference in time probably in cultural time was a matter of different epochs. The action of \"On The Road\" speaks to an almost subterranean escape from the bleakness of American conformity in the immediate post-World War II period behind the backs of the squares. The bikers, Fonda and Hopper (Wyatt and Billy, alright), in \"Easy Rider\" are up front and public, as reflected the change in mores of their times, about their \"making and doing\" as they confronted their version of American conformity in the 1960s. In the end they lost that public battle, and we have been fighting a rearguard series of \"culture wars\" battles ever since. But watch this film to get a slice of 1960s Americana. And if you are too young to know some of the references just ask mother and father (or the grandparents, ouch!). They WILL know.\n\nNote: The late Doctor Gonzo\", journalist Hunter Thompson, rather eloquently in HIS countercultural classic, \"Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas\", mentioned toward the end of that fearsome saga that sometime in the late 1960s he could almost see the high tide of the movement ebbing before his eyes signaling the end of all those fierce dreams that we had of that \"newer world\" and the beginning of the approach of the \"night of the long knives.\" \"Easy Rider\" is the cinematic take on that proposition","summary":"Where's Your Easy Rider Gone","unixReviewTime":1275350400,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

In the process they meet a slew of strange yet vital characters in their eventual understanding of their own existence.\n\nThe problem I have with `Easy Rider' is that it doesn't go anywhere for nearly half the film.  I usually adore this freelance style of filmmaking, but `Easy Rider' does not sit well with me at all.  In fact, the film is one gigantic fail for me until Jack Nicholson enters the story.  His performance is outstanding, but I'll get to that in a minute.  The film seems to just hang there, serving as a longwinded music video for some great classic rock tunes and some stunning (yet unrefined) cinematography.  The `profound' statement that this film is trying to make gets lost along the way, only unveiling itself in small doses (like when Nicholson gets preachy in a sleeping bag).\n\n`Easy Rider' is sort of boring.\n\nDennis Hooper's direction can be distracting at times (the way he splices his scenes together is creative yet unnecessary) and the tonal shift of his film towards the end is rather questionable.  In fact, the whole Mardi gras sequence (that psychedelic cemetery trip scene) is staggeringly brilliant yet completely mind-numbing in that it is so out of place it becomes a deterrent to the film, not an aid.  The eventual ending, while wholly prolific and steeped in profound insight, is more of a head-scratcher than anything else.  I think that is my biggest complaint with the films second half (which is far better than the droned out first half).  It is entirely inconsistent and winds up lacking any cohesive feeling.\n\nBut, there is always Jack Nicholson.  His performance is one of the best supporting performances of all time.  It is slick with wit, intelligence, bravado and profound sentiment.  He ties together a lot of loose ends about the `meaning' here, without ever feeling out of place or forced.  His charisma is in tact and his humor is just what this film needed.  I won't demean him by using the phrase `comic relief', but I will say that he spices up a film in dire need of some `spice'.\n\nJack playing Jack to perfection.\n\nIn the end, I have to say that I am NOT impressed with this one.  I was really excited about seeing this, but halfway through I was aching to turn it off.  The only reason I watched it through to completion was the fact that I wanted to see what Nicholson did here, and I'm glad I witnessed that performance.  So, if you are a fan of Jack then see this, for it is one of his best turns (he should have won the Oscar for this), but the film as a whole is not only outdated but uninspired, clumsy and boring.\n\nThis is the definition of a missed opportunity.","summary":"Easy now...","unixReviewTime":1272931200,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

At the time, I was dealing with my application for Conscientious Objector status with the draft board.  I was also being hassled by the FBI as an outspoken critic of the Viet Nam war.\n\nThe movie poster of Fonda as Captain America with a flag-embossed jacket riding on a big bike with the caption \"A man went looking for American and couldn't find it anywhere\" resonated with me.\n\nSPOILER ALERT: And at the end, when the redneck in the pickup with the bulging tumor shoots \"Billy\" and \"Wyatt (Fonda and Dennis Hopper)\" I was incensed.  I felt I was the victim! This was the same world I was in.  The same prejudice.  The same hate.  Reel life was real life.

This movie empowered me.  I realized I was not alone in how I saw the world, the war and America.\n\nAs a film student, I was not just interested in film as propaganda, but also in how the film was shot.  I knew it was shot for cheap - less than $500K.  (Recently, I ran into Fonda and he told me the actual cost was $250,000!)

There was the innovative use of music I actually listened too.  Wow, the Electric Prunes!  How did they know?\n\nI wondered if the dope they smoked on screen was real and I asked Fonda.

Amith","reviewText":"In 1969, the film \"Easy Rider\" debuted with much fanfare in America.  Not only would the film receive distinction as an important film that depicted the late 60's in America but it would be the first Independent film to be created with a low budget (under $400,000) and made $19 million dollars in the box office.  And help install confidence for the film studios that a Independent films can be successful and also a film created on a low budget can be successful as well.  Not only that, the film would be groundbreaking in that it used contemporary rock music at that time by The Jimi Hendrix Experience, The Byrds, Steppenwolf and more.\n\n\"Easy Rider\" would star very good friends Dennis Hopper (\"Colors\", \"The Last Movie\", \"Hoosiers\") and Peter Fonda (\"The Last Movie\", \"South Beach\", \"3:10 to Yuma\") in which Hopper would direct and Fonda would produce.  The two also wrote the film along with Terry Southern (\"Barbarella\", \"Casino Royale\", \"The Telephone\").\n\nThe film revolves around two bikers Wyatt (Fonda) and Billy (Hopper) who begin the movie by smuggling drugs from Mexico to Los Angeles and making a very good profit.  With the money, the two can do what they want and that is to go on a on a road trip on their Harley Davidson choppers and drive to New Orleans, Louisiana for Mardi Gras.\n\nWyatt hides the money in his motorcycle's gas tank and the two embark on a trip enjoying the scenery and the freedom of traveling America.  Throughout the trip, we see the two drive and see the scenery of the trees, mountains and the open road way with popular music at that time.\n\nDuring their trip, they encounter a hitchhiker (Luke Askew, \"Manhunter\", \"The Quest\") who they pick up and drive to a hippie commune.  Then the two end up driving through a parade in which they don't have a permit and end up being put in jail.  This is where they meet ACLU lawyer George Hanson (Jack Nicholson, \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", \"Terms of Endearment\", \"As Good As It Gets\") and learn that he is a drunkard but has always wanted to go to Mardi Gras.\n\nSo, when the two are released, they head out to New Orleans but what they don't expect is that what may have seem like freedom so far, until they hit certain areas they learn that people's perception of them are different.  People with long hair or people wearing leather pants are being looked at as \"hippie queers\" and the prejudice runs deep in those parts of America.\n\n\"Easy Rider: 40th Anniversary\" was hailed by Time Magazine as \"one of the ten most important pictures of the decade\" and entered the Library of Congress National Registry in 1998 because the film showcases America during that volatile time back in the late 60's.\n\nThe independent film was also quite volatile behind-the-scenes as Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda who were close friends at the beginning of the film, because of the demands of the film, the two had a falling out.  The film featured a lot of fighting between the crew, there was a lot of drug use with not only the cast but also the crew.  In fact, some of the scenes used on the film, the talent were wasted on marijuana and some have said that it was remarkable how much the actors were able to work while high on drugs.\n\nThe famous choppers that the two drove, although there were four total, two for backup.  The person in charge of watching over the choppers, Tex Hall, had a robbery attempt at his home with a shotgun on him and his girlfriend and the motorcycles were stolen.\n\nAnd as for the people in the small towns, Hopper used actual people not actors and thus what we are truly seeing in the film are real reactions by Southerners in Louisiana reacting to the men who had long hair (Hopper) and Fonda's black leather pants.  These were just a few things that happened behind-the-scenes of \"Easy Rider\".\n\nNeedless to say, \"Easy Rider\" is definitely a time capsule for that moment of time and not only do you get the film, you also get the \"Easy Rider: Shaking the Cage\" in which viewers get to learn from each cast and crew of how volatile things were while shooting the film and things that happened behind-the-scenes that will definitely surprise people.\n\nVIDEO & AUDIO:\n\n\"Easy Rider\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1) for the first time.  For a film created back in 1968, the film looks absolutely great, not perfect but still great.  No blemishes and certain outdoor scenes look absolutely fantastic and for a film 40-years-old, I have to say that it looks better than many films that I have seen released back in the 1980's and 90's.  Grain is kept and for the most part, detail of the chopper's, Billy's clothing, Wyatt's sunglasses, you see that detail. There were some scenes, such as the visit to the commune where picture quality seems a little aged compared to the rest of the film but for the most part, this is the best looking version of \"Easy Rider\" to date.\n\nAs for audio, the film is presented in English, French and Portuguese Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  Also in Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and the original English mono soundtrack.  For the most part, the film is front and center channel driven and during my first viewing, but that impressive soundtrack that this film is known for is nice and clear, dialogue is nice and clear and the revving of the motorcycles is nice and clear.  The film is dialogue and music driven and there is surround channel usage during the trippy drug-induced parts of the film when you hear voice all around you but also during that brief and tragic action sequence at the end of the film.  But the music...from hearing that bass guitar and percussion in union on \"If 6 was 9' from The Jimi Hendrix Experience to that electric guitar and well known vocals of Steppenwolf of \"Born to Be Wild\" with the men on their bikes, that's classic but to hear it on DolbyTrue HD is awesome!\n\nSpeaking of the film's soundtrack, \"Easy Rider\" was one of the first films to have an original score and feature popular contemporary rock songs at that time.  Included in the film are:\n\n  * Steppenwolf - The Pusher\n  * Steppenwolf - Born to Be Wild\n  * The Byrds - Wasn't Born to Follow\n  * The Band - The Weight\n  * The Holy Modal Rounders - If You Want to Be a Bird\n  * Fraternity of  Man - Don't Bogart Me\n  * The Jimi Hendrix Experience - If 6 Was 9\n  * Electric Prunes - Kyrie Eleison\n  * The Electric Flag - Flash, Bam, Pow\n  * Roger McGuinn - It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\n  * Roger McGuinn - Ballad of Easy Rider\n\nAs for subtitles, the subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese and Spanish.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES\n\n\"Easy Rider: 40th Anniversary\" receives Sony's special digibook packaging with a total of 36-pages and information on the music, the talent and an essay of the importance of the film and the beginning of New Hollywood.  As for special features, the following are included:\n\n  * MovieIQ - Viewers can watch the film via BD-Live and get up-to-date details on the characters, behind-the-scene factoids, music and more.\n  * Audio Commentary by Dennis Hopper - When it comes to \"Easy Rider\", as mentioned by the people who worked on the film, everyone has a story and in this case, we hear Dennis Hopper's commentary of the film.  For the most part its informative but Hopper tends to not speak for long stretches in time (I'm guessing he was engrossed in watching the film) and he's actually quite quiet.\n  * Easy Rider, Shaking the Cage Documentary - (1:04:51) The crew and talent of \"Easy Rider\" give us a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of this film, how volatile things were and also dangerous.  An amazing documentary. Note: This documentary was featured in the DVD release and is featured in standard definition, English stereo and subtitles in Portuguese and Spanish.\n\nJUDGMENT CALL:\n\n\"Easy Rider: 40th Anniversary\" makes it's HD debut and for the most part, the result is making this Blu-ray release the definitive version to own with its impressive picture quality and for those who wanted to hear that awesome soundtrack in lossless audio, you have that option as well as the original theatrical mono version as well.\n\nWhen I was watching the film, you can tell how special and how unique the film truly was.  It's one thing to have a motorcycle road film and showcasing the allure of someone that can be seen as an outlaw but in this film, it truly is a time capsule as we are watching something that captures America during that time.  From recreating the hippie commune of New Buffalo (in New Mexico) of many hippie men and women with kids all over the place to capturing that Southern feel towards hippies and men in leather (the guys weren't gay but because of they were outside of the norm of that area, they were considered offensive) and of course, the music, the motorcycles, the drug use.  That's the late 60's.\n\nAlso, some may view \"Easy Rider\" as a creative and artistic film as Hopper wanted to take advantage of creative editing styles but it would be interesting to see how his original 220 minute feature would be compared to the Henry Jaglom edited final 95 minute theatrical version.\n\n\"Easy Rider\" was also a first.  Being an independent film created less than $400,000 and making millions.  Jack Nicholson who was planning to quit from acting, was made a bonafide star thanks in part to this film and of course, ushering the new era of Hollywood and received the distinction of being in the American Film Institute's \"Top 100 Films of All Time\" (at #88) and Steppenwolf's \"Born to Be Wild\" at #29 for \"Top 100 Songs of All Time\".\n\nAnd of course, the behind-the-scenes making of the film and knowing how drugged out the talent were during the filming and how some improvised scenes or scenes that were not in the script, ended up in the film is quite interesting.\n\nIf you have never owned \"Easy Rider\", this film deserves to be in your collection.  This is one of those rare films that manages to capture American culture at that time.  This film embodies the term \"sex, drugs and rock n' roll\" and once you are done with the film, \"Easy Rider: Shaking the Cage\", the documentary will definitely impress you.\n\nIf you are a cinema fan, \"Easy Rider: 40th Anniversary\" on Blu-ray is a film that deserves to be in your collection.  Even if you owned a previous version and not much is added in terms of special featuers content, the film is worth the double dip for that awesome HD presentation and it's rockin' lossless soundtrack.  This film is highly recommended!","summary":"Blu-ray: This is the definitive version to own of the film right now and is highly recommended!","unixReviewTime":1255996800,"vote":14.0,"image":null}

That is, I could not do it without also reviewing it within the context of two other movies that I had just recently watched because all three of them have such a similar theme. In fact, they all have so many things in common that I decided to review all three of them at the same time as a medley, something I have never done before but which seems called for. If you'll follow me, you'll see what I'm getting at.\n\nI was recently talking to a friend of mine at work when we happened to run into each other in the men's room. He asked me if I had ever seen the film EASY RIDER, and I answered that it was interesting and very synchronistic that he should ask me that because it was the last movie that I had just enjoyed watching at home on DVD. I said, \"Man, you know, I was JUST watching that last week! I LOVE that movie. I wanted to get the deluxe edition but I could not find it anywhere, so I just picked up the regular one at GIANT (the local supermarket) in the bargain bin for nine bucks.\" My friend, Ian, then said, \"I only own three movies in my collection: EASY RIDER, THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, and INTO THE WILD. Have you seen the other two?\" I answered that I had not and that I had always wanted to see the both of them, to which he quickly replied, \"You can borrow mine, man. I'll bring them in tomorrow for you.\" \"Hey, thanks a lot, man,\" I replied with gratitude, and we both went back to work.\n\nI watched both of those movies Ian let me borrow over the weekend of April 10, 11, 12, 2009 right on the heels of having watched EASY RIDER just weeks before. The amazing amount of similar themes running through all three of these films is impressive. All three of these movies express a preference for wandering and wonder over worrying and war for the characters involved. Each of them seems to express the plight of characters dealing with their own, personal rejection of the reality of petty worries and war (The Iliad), and choosing, instead, a life of venturing forth into the unknown world of wonder and wandering (The Odyssey). The characters in all three of these movies depict a great love of adventure and a great joy of being out on the open road. Jack Kerouac, author of ON THE ROAD, would have loved all three of these fantastic films, especially INTO THE WILD, as he was a great lover of the books of Jack London. Also, they all have a great, cinematic and panoramic, wide-angle viewpoint of the world. Watching these films gets one out of one's own head and puts one right into the world of the film. The scenery in all three films is stunning and absolutely breathtaking. The viewer is immediately projected \"into the wild\" world (if you will) of the characters. It's intense! You get taken along for a ride that goes not only far and wide out into the world but, also, deep into the hidden spaces of one's heart and mind. All three of these films will make you think about your own life in particular as well as the greater meaning of life in general. They are deep, psychological films that demand conscious labor of intellectual thought and emotional soul searching on the part of the viewer. You get taken for a ride, but it is definitely NOT \"easy!\"\n\nIn my case, watching these films - especially INTO THE WILD - brought me back to a time when I myself, like the character in the movie, was 22 years old and questioning my place in life: what I wanted to be, what I wanted to do, where I wanted to live, how I wanted to live, and who I wanted to be with. I realize now that I was seeking a sense of place to fit in and a community to be a part of that I felt comfortable in more than merely trying to \"find myself.\" But understanding that when you are going through it is another thing altogether. Watching INTO THE WILD hits home on all these points and more! I remember having just seen The Grateful Dead in concert in Hartford, Connecticut with my good buddy, Jimmy, in May of 1997, and feeling like I wanted to just bust loose of all of the constraints of society that seemed to be holding me back from my true calling - whatever that was. I was feeling like a wild animal caught in a trap, and I wanted to be free. I had dropped out of college almost two years before, and I had been working at two jobs back in my hometown of Lowell, Massachusetts. That summer, like the kid in INTO THE WILD, I planned to get away and I bought a bunch of camping equipment, quit my jobs, and hit the road. I first went up north to New York State to camp out with some members of the Neo-American Church in the region of Cranberry Lake. When I decided not to stay and started to trek back out to head off somewhere else, my glasses fell off of my head and into the muddy, swampy muck I had found myself in along the water's edge. It took me an hour to find them. I realized then and there that I was handicapped for this kind of wandering around with all this heavy weight on my shoulders. So, I hitchhiked back home, feeling just as lost and just as confused as ever. I continued to read hundreds of books to find an answer to my quest for authenticity and community, only to learn that I was just making the book stores richer. I tried yet again to break away that fall, and went back to western Massachusetts to see if I could find work out near my friends who were still going to school there. I could relate to the scene in INTO THE WILD where Christopher writes in his diary of all freedom seekers in the history of this country seeking it by going out \"west.\" Whenever I would hear the lyrics to \"Stairway to Heaven\" by Led Zeppelin, when Robert Plants sings: \"There's a feeling I get when I look to the west and my spirit is crying for leaving,\" I would feel an urge inside me to head out west before I got too old to do it. Indeed, Christopher tries to inspire the old man who wanted to adopt him in the film (Hank Holbrook) to do the very same thing! After spending two weeks looking for work with no luck, and deciding not to move into a deserted cabin or tepee built out in the back woods of a local farmer's land because of the weather and being all alone, I left the generous hospitality of my good friend, Greg, and once more headed back home to find my way that way. Years later, after working an assortment of odd jobs over many years, I eventually ended up opening my own health food store in the summer of 1989 after deciding not to buy some land way up north in Maine or Vermont near the Canadian border - the only place I could afford land at the time. I concluded that if I bought the land, I would never be able to later do the health food store (one of the last business bastions left of hippiedom in corporate America), but if I opened the store and did not like it, I could always cash-in and then go off and buy some land somewhere out in the woods. I was always talking about \"moving to Alaska,\" to live in freedom and stuff like that - so I can really relate to what Christopher McCandless (the real character and promising young man of the true story of INTO THE WILD) was going through. I felt like I was looking at myself re-living my past. He took the path I almost took. I turned back. He never got the chance to. God only knows where he would be today if he had lived to tell his story!\n\nI have a cousin who actually did the same thing once. He was even younger than me when he did it. My cousin, George, actually made it all the way to Alaska, and then Hawaii, and then Europe as well. He went all around the world. When he reached Alaska, he hooked up with some of his old friends from Dunstable, Massachusetts who had also moved up there to make money working on the pipeline and on fishing boats. He found work up there for a while, too, just like some of the characters in these three films. They worked along the way to help to make their journey. George ended up finding his friend, Jim Lavrakas, a famous photographer today for the Anchorage Daily News in Alaska. Ernesto and Alberto worked in a Leper Colony for a while in Peru. Christopher McCandless worked out in the fields cutting grain for a while to help pay his way. I have a good friend named Phil who actually did do what I had once intended on doing myself. He worked his butt off for years, saved a bunch of cash, and bought himself 25 acres of land up in Maine where he lives off the grid out in the woods as an independent, organic farmer and orchard grower. He says he did it to be able to live like a free man out on the land away from all of the social evils and urban ugliness of the city. He also wanted to be free and independent of his family, like Chris in INTO THE WILD. He did it. I guess I was too much of a homebody and a Hobbit to live alone all by myself out in the woods somewhere where no one knew me. It takes courage to live alone like Thoreau out in the wild. You need guts to do this kind of stuff. I know that one reason why I returned back home from my meager attempt at wandering through the woods was that I really missed music. I am a musician. There is no way to jam with other people and enjoy music and dance when you live alone out in the woods. It is impossible. Nevertheless, till this day, the TV series that ran in the early nineties about life up in a small town called Cicely, Alaska - NORTHERN EXPOSURE - is still my all-time, favorite television program. It had colorful characters. I guess some romantic ideas die hard.\n\nIt takes a lot of courage to leave the comforts of home and cut loose from all of your support system of family and friends and to just take off and hit the road to God knows where. It's a \"wild world,\" as Cat Stevens sings, and you've got to take care. All three films show the major characters getting into trouble out on the road. \"Alexander Supertramp\" (the vagabond name Christopher McCandless chose for himself after cutting up his social security card and all of his other documents of official identity before he hit the road) got the hell beaten out of him by railroad man one dark night when he was hobo-ing it out on a train. Both Ernesto and Alberto got chased out of town by a jealous husband and all of his hometown buddies after one of his friends saw the husband's wife flirting and dancing with Ernesto on the dance floor. In EASY RIDER, Peter Fonda's motorcycle gets a flat tire (the least of their troubles) just like Alberto's motorcycle kept on breaking down and eventually dying on them in THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES. These young characters in all of these films were not exactly experiencing the metaphysical revelations of Robert M. Pirsig in his masterful ZEN AND THE ART OF MOTORCYCLE MAINTENANCE - at least not at first - but they certainly all ran into a lot of trouble. The spiritual revelations began to come to them later, along the way. Indeed, all the major characters have major transformational experiences in one way or another as a result of their personal quests and traveling adventures. The road changes you. Also, there are many forks in the road, as Neil Young most recently informs us. It's hard to decide sometimes which way to go.\n\nThis changing of one's name seems to be a prerequisite to being a beat, road warrior out on the highway. Not only does Christopher change his name, but in EASY RIDER, the character played by Peter Fonda changes his name from Wyatt to \"Captain America,\" and the character played by Dennis Hopper begins to call himself \"Billy the Kid,\" both taking on the persona of Wild West characters of historical, American lore. In THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, Ernesto begins to be called \"Fuser\" and \"Che\" (the name that stuck with him for the rest of his life!) while his buddy, Alberto, begins to be called \"Mial.\" It's almost as if one has to shed one's former identity as a snake sheds its skin in order to take on one's true identity - and this requires the taking on of a new name, one which reflects one's true identity.\n\nAnother thing these movies have in common is the pairing of a more sensitive and reflective character with a more rough & tumble and more aggressive character. In the case of INTO THE WILD, the character - who is very sensitive and contemplative - is paired up against the people he meets on his journey along the way, many of which tend to be less graceful and sensitive as he is. In THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, Ernesto is very much like the character that Peter Fonda portrays in EASY RIDER, and Alberto is, also, very much like the character that Dennis Hopper plays. The likeness is astounding. Ernesto, like Christopher McCandless in INTO THE WILD, is always writing in his journal and thinking about the deeper meaning of things. Peter Fonda, as well, is portrayed as the more thoughtful and contemplative one than the rambunctious and womanizing Dennis Hopper. One character is graceful and patient, full of compassion for other people, while the other is less refined and always in a hurry, and somewhat more selfish. They are like The Odd Couple - but riding on motorcycles!\n\nAnother theme that runs deeply through all three films is the powerful and destiny changing power of rivers! The awesome power of the natural world, exemplified by a river in all three films, is undeniable. You can't miss it. In the case of INTO THE WILD, it was the raging force of the rolling river rapids that prevented Chris from crossing back in the spring to the other side from which he came. It was too wide, too deep, and with waters gushing too fast to cross. He was forced to go back to the bus where he had been living all winter. It ultimately decided his destiny for him. He almost drowned in it on his attempt to cross it. In the end, it was because of the river which separated him from all that he cared about in his past that sealed his fate. The poison plants he mistakenly ingested while he was starving did not help, either. In the case of EASY RIDER, it was along the river that both characters met their fate, and got blown away by a couple of backwoods rednecks out for a spin in their pickup truck. Maybe it was their bad karma? Still, the injustice of the moment is profound, as one watches Peter Fonda's motorcycle go up in flames while Roger McGuinn of the Byrds sings Bob Dylan's song, \"The Ballad of Easy Rider,' as the lyrics \"flow, river flow\" repeat throughout the song like the flowing river itself. In the case of THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, it was along the river where Ernesto found himself, in the sense of his true calling, while administering to a sick, leper woman who made him realize that there are other ways to heal people - and prevent them from getting sick in the first place - than by being a physician to individuals. Society itself can be in great need of a social healer. The river separated the sick lepers on one side from the hospital care workers on the other. Ernesto refused to wear the superstitious rubber gloves on his hands from the very first day. One night, on his birthday, he had a spiritual rebirth when he took a rite of passage and dove into the river, swimming all the way across to the other side where all of the sick lepers along the shore encouraged him on. On doing so, he once and for all proved to his friend, Alberto, that he was no wimp but a true man with determination and courage. He showed an inner strength that inspired all of those around him. How they cheered his victory over the river! He would not be stopped by anything. That came later, when he was \"Che Guevara\" the revolutionary in Bolivia, when the sneaky CIA killed him. His nobility still shines brightly! Like \"Alexander Supertramp\" in INTO THE WILD and \"Captain America\" in EASY RIDER, he had a huge heart and a great soul. He truly cared about people.\n\nAnother theme that runs through all three of these films is a sense of loneliness. The number on the bus that Christopher lived in depicted in INTO THE WILD is number 142. Numerologically, this adds up to a number 7 - the number of solitude and loneliness. In EASY RIDER, the character played by Peter Fonda ends up all alone in a New Orleans cemetery, perched atop a statue of the Virgin Mary while he's peaking on LSD in a death-rebirth acid trip-induced mystical experience, screaming out in tears to his real dead mother and asking her why she killed herself, leaving him all alone. In THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, you find Ernesto feeling more and more isolated from his friend and feeling lonely after he receives the \"Dear John letter\" from his girlfriend who they had visited just weeks before. His sense of loss and isolation is profound. His shattered dream of a romantic relationship with this woman cleared the path to true enlightenment for him. The viewer can sense this profoundly at the end of the film when you see him saying goodbye to Alberto before getting alone onto the aeroplane waiting to take him away toward his ultimate destiny. All three of these characters experienced major spiritual transformations along their journey out on the road of life far away from home.\n\nOne last characteristic that all the major characters in these three films have in common is their persistent, uncompromising, diligently determined drive to all reach their goals - for good or ill. They are all absolutely hell-bent on following their dreams and dancing to the beat of their own drummer. They all choose freedom over security. Ironically, they all consciously choose the path of Odysseus - of wandering - but they all end up reaching the same end as Achilles - of dying young in a flame of glory. That's fate. The ancient Greeks called her \"Moira.\" Even the Gods themselves are at her mercy. In EASY RIDER, Billy was always pushing his more contemplative partner onward toward their goal of reaching the famous whorehouse in New Orleans. It almost seems as if the only reason why \"Captain America\" wanted to also go was to pay his respects to their long lost companion, George (played dramatically by Jack Nicholson) the attorney who got them out of jail, whose idea it was to go there in the first place. Peter Fonda's character was loyal to a fault when it came to his friendship with Billy. In THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, Alberto (the horny rascal) was always pushing Ernesto to go out of his spiritual centeredness and jump into the dangerous fray of the more seedy side of life. Finally, in INTO THE WILD, it was \"Alexander Supertramp's\" intense reaction to the constant, dysfunctional fighting between his mother and father back home that pushed him on and outward to not ever end up in the same situation himself. We must also acknowledge that all of these characters were young and anxious to sew some of their wild oats, a natural condition of youth everywhere.\n\nOne might ask what would have happened to all of these characters if they had changed their minds along the way of their respective, individual quests and decided, instead, to stay with companions they had met along the way, or turn back and go back home? I remember when I first saw EASY RIDER as a kid, when it first came out in 1969. We all went to the movie theater as a group and all watched it together, getting a kick out of hippies smoking real pot, live and on camera. Some of us thought they should have stayed in the hippie commune. If they had lived, would they have stayed together? Would \"Captain America\" have gone back to be with those people? The same goes for INTO THE WILD. What would have happened if Christopher had stayed longer with his hippie friends in the trailer park? What would have happened if he left Alaska before the ice melted and went back to be with the girl he sang with who was a musician and who clearly cared for him? In THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, what would have happened if Ernesto changed his mind and went back to be with his girlfriend? Would there have ever been a Cuban revolution? It's interesting that the characters in EASY RIDER had the goal of reaching a whorehouse, and the character in THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES - \"Che Guevara\" - was instrumental in ridding CUBA of all of its underworld-controlled and corrupt, exploitative whorehouses and gambling casinos! Who woulda thunk that - coming from this bookish, sensitive doctor!\n\nUltimately, what one comes away learning from all three of these films, and which is expressed at the end of INTO THE WILD by Christopher McCandless, is that what really matters most in life is true happiness and peace of mind, and that the only way to be truly fulfilled and happy is by sharing it with other people. Happiness can only be found in community. To reach a real community where you can truly be yourself and live an authentic life is a real blessing. Billy and \"Captain America\" never got the chance. Christopher McCandless learned this truth - but too late to live it. Only Ernesto reached the higher octave of societal existence and sustained a life on a higher level of community involvement through his unbending will and indomitable spirit to \"work for the good of the whole,\" as my friend, Al, likes to say. He was true to himself; that is, he took what he learned from being alone on the road away from home and brought it back with him to transform society back home and, ultimately, everywhere. He may have fallen off that damn, rickety, old motorcycle one too many times to be content with the trust in machinery and mechanical living to the extent that most people allow themselves to fall prey to. He found true freedom from the fold by transforming the fold itself, and it was life on the road that transformed him.\n\nThoreau said it best: \"In wilderness is the preservation of the world.\" Wandering through the wilderness is dynamically healing!\n\n...

This film succeeds in documenting the 60s counter-culture a.k.a. hippy generation very well and explores even deeper issues in addressing questions such as what is freedom and does it really exist in the \"land of the free and the home of the brave?\"  Fonda and Hopper play a couple of bikers who ironically in trying to live a free life become hated by the mainstream who fear what this freedom represents.  This eventually results in their persecution and destruction.  I really enjoyed all the symbolism that inundates throughout the film from the insertion of the money into the gas tank painted with the Stars and Stripes symbolising how drug money obtained from drug pushing is effectively screwing the nation for example to the murderous scenes at the end symbolising the hypocrisy of a nation that espouses freedom that kills the very citizens that strive to practice it in its purest form.\n\nJack Nicholson is excellent here as the drunken lawyer who is sympathetic to the bikers at the ultimate personal cost although the entire cast I thought was very good.  This film also must contain what must be one of the best ever movie soundtracks which has been very well remastered into Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound quality.  The only unfortunate thing about this dvd version though is the poor picture quality which is full of imperfections such as white spots throughout.  Here's hoping the future Blu-ray release will address this issue.\n\nOtherwise, this is an excellent film that attempts to hide nothing and to fully show life in a certain period of the 60s warts and all.  No film buff's dvd library should be without this title but wait for a properly restored version perhaps on Blu-ray to surface and give this version a miss.\n\nInspired film-making that rewards repeated viewing.\n\nUpdated 29 May 2011:\n\nAs Amazon will not allow me to review this separately the Blu-Ray version of this film is a little of a mixed bag as both the picture and sound qualities although an improvement over the dvd version are only slightly so.  As this was a low budget affair I suspect the 16 mm film can only look so much better even on 1080p without a proper restoration which hasn't been done here.  Still, if you haven't already got this film then this blu-ray version is the best there is to date but if you already have the dvd, it's tough to justify the double dip.  Maybe you will want to wait to see if a proper full-scale restoration is done on the picture quality for every frame and if they will provide a proper DTS HD MA 5.1 surround option as well as the Dolby True HD and PCM Surround options for some reason are not much better than the dvd version.","summary":"Wow!

The teaming of Peter Fonda (his top film), Dennis Hopper, and Jack Nicholson was pure brillance in casting.\n\nThe story is about two free spirits who score a big dope\/cash connection in Mexico and then head east, cross-country on their chopper motorcycles, for New Orleans where they intend to celebrate Mardi Gras with the masses. Along the way, they encounter all manner of people and societies including poor Mexican families, hippies in a commune, really mean rednecks, and many more.\n\nThe larger theme here is the perceived freedom of the sixties, which turns out at every intersection to be little more than a fantasy. But I need to say right here that the filmscore for this movie represents one of the top Classic Rock albums of the 20th Century. Jimi Hendrix, Steppenwolf.... need I say more?\n\nThe top performance in this film, no question, was by Jack Nicholson who plays a drunken, seedy, small-town lawyer who throws caution to the wind and permanently forsakes his small-town life to ride with the boys to Mardi Gras, his pilgrammage of sorts.\n\nIf you have any interest whatever in the 60s, in rock music, or in the sociology of the free-love society, you really cannot afford to miss this incredible art-film.

Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper ride on a wirlwind journey of America after making money on a drug deal.  Along the way they meet a rather straight-laced (so to say) attorney played by Jack Nicholson.  It is their story and a remarkable road trip on a bike.  This movie brought us 3 great actors---Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson.  The sound track is incredible and this 35th anniversary DVD collection has a CD that includes the theme, \"Born to be Wild\" and many more.  I watched this classic movie again tonight for a different reason.\n\nFor those Amazon friends that know me, I am a motorcycle enthusiast.  I love and have a passion for all motorcycles from dirt, speed and street.  I currently have a custom Harley (I had the photo of it on my profile, but had to remove it).  I do ride it on the dangerous streets in the city where I live.  If you never rode, as the driver, you cannot appreciate the feeling---being on the back is not the same.  Motorcycle riding has given me plenty of confidence, and it has taught me to be a better driver in a car or a boat.  When I have a bad day or week (which is currently happening), I hop on the bike and it's amazing---your problems disappear (for the moment).  I was taught to ride by a guy I was supposed to marry who was a motorcross racer, but it didn't work out.  I was a young stupid kid then and if I continued that way I would have surely been a statistic.  My husband, Darrell, suggested I learn the right way all over again.  I enrolled in a course.  I had the most incredible teacher who did not make fun of me or get angry during class and was very patient.  I am 5'3\" and weigh about 100 pounds---pretty small to hold up a Harley.  He saw I was determined and cheered me on. Long after, when I had my accident he went over with me on how it happened, never ridiculing, but still teaching.  I wouldn't have been hurt had I had on my proper riding gear.  This one person, my teacher, Daniel David Jorasz was killed on his bike this past week, riding the right way.  A b@#ch lost control of her car trying to avoid a ladder, spun her car around on the freeway and hit Dan (\"Double D\") head on, he was killed instantly.  Proper riding attire didn't matter, though.  Please, if you drive a car avoid driving with a cell phone attached to your ear or under the influence or any other distractions, you never know what could happen and you could kill an innocent person.

But few such films prove potent enough to retain the favor of audiences in perpetuity. 35 years after the film's release, audiences around the world are still captivated by the raw vision of Easy Rider is no small accomplishment. To this day, the image of Fonda and Hopper (neither of whom knew how to ride a motorcycle before making this film) careening helmetless down the open highway to the tune of Steppenwolf's \"Born to be Wild\" defines the American biker motif more clearly than any Hell's Angel could ever hope to.\" Bart Zeigler\n\n\"Get your motor runnin'\nHead out on the highway\nLookin' for adventure\nAnd whatever comes our way\" Steppenwolf- \"Born To be Wild'\n\n37 years after 'Easy Rider' was first shown, I viewed the movie again. I was prepared to think I remembered the story, the story of an American myth, with anitheroes riding from the West only this time on bikes into the evil of middle America. I thought the best thing about the film was the soundtrack. It was an important film but not a very good one. Then I watched it, and I was hooked from scene one. The film drew me in, such a very good film. Not perfect but very good. Dennis Hopper's character,was so real, the dishelveled, long-haired. I remember many people who dressed and acted just like him. He directed the film and gave the character's names Wyatt and Billy, old west names discovering new territory. The acting was natural, not self-conciuous. It covers alot of territory in 90 plus minutes. The landscapes so beautiful and unspoiled. The surprises were the fact that Phil Spectre was cast as the connection- how trite and real is that? The early scene with the rancher and his family was one of the beautiful scenes of the film. Wyatt tells the rancher: \"It's not everyman who can live off the land, you know, doing his own thing his own time. You should be proud.\"\n\nThe film comes alive when George, played by Jack Nicholsen as an ACLU lawyer. What a handsome dude, a purveyor of many roles to come. I remembered wondering about his character and thinking his Southern accent was too much and his football helmet silly. Now I understand about the football helmet and George's speech about how America used to be \"a helluva good country\". That night around the campfire, he samples grass for the first time, \"Lord have mercy, is that what that is?\" But best of all, is Peter Fonda and the quiet, intelligent, Captain America\/Wyatt. He moves through the movie with, as my best friend would say, a noblesse oblige, a retired drug pusher who casts away his past and his allegiance to time with his wristwatch. Captain America and Billy find the whorehouse George directed them to and drop acid in the cemetery with two hookers, Karen Black in a great role. It is a long acid trip that sets the standard for hallucination portrayals for years to come. It's a bad trip, but maybe they chose the wrong place with the wrong people. And all is not well in the land of the free. A brief run-in with a few local yokels leads to their undoing. I'd thought Easy Rider would seem dated. Turns out it's timeless.\n\nEasy Rider is a lengthy music video for the '60s culture. But it is also an honest perspective on the counterculture movement. Fonda and Hopper's portrayal of that experience is free of the romanticized tone that characterizes so many other films from this era. Fonda's dialogue the night before his death is a purveyor of things to come. Hopper is happy because they've made it to their destination with their drug money. \"We blew it,\" Fonda tells him. \"We blew it, man.\" Heavy.\n\n\"Easy Rider is the late 1960s \"road film\" tale of a search for freedom (or the illusion of freedom) in a conformist and corrupt America, in the midst of paranoia, bigotry and violence. Released in the year of the Woodstock concert, and made in a year of two tragic assassinations (Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King), the Vietnam War buildup and Nixon's election, the tone of this 'alternative' film is remarkably downbeat and bleak, reflecting the collapse of the idealistic 60s. Easy Rider, one of the first films of its kind, was a ritualistic experience and viewed (often repeatedly) by youthful audiences in the late 1960s as a reflection of their hopes of liberation and fears of the Establishment.\"\nRoger Ebert\n\n'Easy Rider' took to me a place and time I knew intimately, and I was trasported back to those not so innocent happy times.

It has great performances by many folks down to the louisiana locals who were used to make the movie more authentic. The trip scene was bizare for its time and arguably even for today, but very relatable, if you are 'experienced'. The scenery is absolutely stunning (watch it in WIDEscreen). And it's a great look at a country polarized by cultures and an unpopular war (sound familiar?) Buy the movie but save on the 'extras' till the 'extras' means the whole 4+ hours movie.","summary":"We want more","unixReviewTime":1171238400,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

Written by Dennis Hopper & Peter Fonda (with Terry Southern) and directed by Hopper; Easy Rider is a film that introduced the world to a rising young star named Jack Nicholson, a film that is on The American Film Institute's Top 100 List (#88), and is a brilliant look at the drug\/hippie culture of the 60's. Fonda and Hopper play Wyatt & Billy, two men who experience freedom by riding their motorcycles around. The movie has such a lack of plot; I'm not even entirely sure how to sum it up. Even more amazing is how detailed and elaborate this film actually is. Carrying cocaine in one of the gas tanks, they ride around while encountering various eccentric characters. They also encounter ignorance, bigotry, and, eventually, George Hanson (Nicholson), a drunken lawyer who joins the boys on their ride. Nicholson got an Oscar nomination for his role and receives star billing, but isn't actually in the movie very long. He definitely steals the show, though. The movie, for me, evoked memories of a film called \"Midnight Cowboy.\" It too had star-making performances (by Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight), took a look at the hippie\/Andy Warhol-drug culture, and has a similar grainy look and feel to it. While I think Midnight Cowboy is a better film, Easy Rider is a more important one. Almost anyone who watches it will agree that time hasn't been very kind to the movie, yet people still watch this movie to this day. It's #88 on The American Film Institute's List, but if that list was in order of watched most frequently it would place in the top 10 (probably below or next to Pulp Fiction, Casablanca, The Godfather, A Clockwork Orange, etc.). One of the best (and most haunting) moments comes in the end. That inevitable moment would be changed in today's Hollywood in favor for a happy ending. This is the only ending that could've worked for a movie about guys like these. This is an unforgettable motion picture experience.\n\nGRADE: A-","summary":"Still Important, Still Great.","unixReviewTime":1166227200,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

Richards","reviewText":"This is one of those movies that is on the AFI's \"Top 100 films of all time\" list. In my opinion that list is bogus. Only about a quarter of the films on that list deserve to be there. I don't think Easy Rider is anywhere close to one of the top 100 films of all time. Easy Rider seems fairly pointless. Billy(Dennis Hopper) and Wyatt (Peter Fonda) drive around on their choppers, pick up a hippie, and drive around some more. That sums up the first half of the film. Don't get me wrong, it isn't exactly boring, but it isn't exactly a great story either. To be honest this movie doesn't really have a story.\n\nDennis Hopper directed this film and the word is that he was completely stoned out of his mind. I can believe that. There is a scene at the end where the Billy and Wyatt drop some acid and go on a little trip with two hookers in a cemetary. To me it seems pretty easy to shoot an acid trip. Just shoot random stuff, cut it together randomly and voila! You have your scene. Or better yet, give the camera to a monkey. The out of focus shots and frenetic animal jerkiness will only add to the overall aesthetic of the scene. Its ok for the first 20 seconds, but anything longer than that gets monotonous.\n\nJack Nicholson is amazing as usual. He is so good, so convincing, and has such presence that he completely steals every scene that he is in. The other actors are good too in their own ways; Dennis Hopper made me laugh several times, but then again watching stoned guys do stupid things will usually make you laugh anyway.\n\nThe cinematography is very good. Lszl Kovcs does good work and he captures the scenery very well. God knows there is plenty of time for that during the course of the movie. There is a little incongruity towards the end when they try to match 16mm footage with the rest of the 35mm film, but other than that the picture is good. There are some weird things done with the editing that I didn't really understand or care for. There is a reoccuring theme of stuttering images before cutting to a new scene. It kind of seems like a film student experiment that was left in the film accidently.\n\nI'll bet this movie was great back in the days of hippies and woodstock, but now it just comes off flat. It does give some insight into that time period, but there are many other better films that can do the same thing and tell you a story at the same time.\n\nMy rating: 2 of 5","summary":"Easy Rider","unixReviewTime":1156723200,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

Along the way they hit the highs and lows of the then American Dream. In a time only a few years after the murder of the Civil Rights workers in Philadelphia, Mississippi, Brown versus The Board of Education, and still dual drinking fountains, Wyatt (Fonda) and Billy (Hopper) try to get served in the South, pick up Nicholson, smoke a lot of herb, and eventually are crushed by their dream. It's a poetic piece which meant a lot to us when we saw it. Regrettably, there were wrongs with that America and Fonda and Hopper were subtle enough to point some of them out without being too heavy handed. They let us see the South they saw and listen to the rather haunting words of Nicholson.\n\nThe picture has now become a milestone for low budget producers saying sopmething worthwhile.

Markel","reviewText":"This review is for the 1999 (40th Anniversary Edition) Columbia DVD.\n\nThe movie in a nutshell involves two hippies, Wyatt (Peter Fonda) also known as \"Captain America\" and Billy (Dennis Hopper), who score a huge cocaine deal in Mexico and unload it on a rich guy (Phil Spector) in California.  The two then decide to travel by motorcycle to the Mardi Gras in New Orleans to have a great time.  This sets up the rest of the film for many offbeat and bizarre encounters on this free-spirited road trip.\n\nI was only ten years old when 'Easy Rider' came out, and without even seeing it, I can recall how popular the movie was.  In fact, it was very common to see a large black & white poster of Peter Fonda on his chrome chopper, with the helmet and gas tank colorized in florescent red, white and blue.  For the counterculture\/anti-establishment crowd, it would seem that traveling cross country on a Harley with a stash of money, drugs along with easy sexual encounters was the new American dream.  It wasn't until recently I had the chance to watch this film in its entirety on DVD, and the sense of free-spirited travel across scenic landscapes holds up well and so does a lot of the music, especially songs like \"Born to be Wild\" and several of the songs by the Byrds.  In addition, the movie has some great moments including just about every scene that features Jack Nicholson.  But sadly, communal living, acid trips, getting high on pot, having unprotected sex with prostitutes and dealing drugs for money just dates this film miserably.  All of this wouldn't be necessarily bad especially if it was a bust-your-gut comedy, but unfortunately the film idealizes this lifestyle and plays too heavy-handed against their stereotypical Southern oppressors - especially in the final scene.  Overall, I did like this movie for the cinemetography, music and nostalgia, but wasn't at all sold on the manipulative and outdated message.  However, it's definitely one of these movies like Woodstock, that brings insight, be it good or bad, into the hippie counter-culter of the late 1960's.\n\nThe DVD picture quality is great.  I can only recall seeing roughly four or five tiny specs of film deterioration during the entire film.  The colors and sharpness are fantastic and the stereo sound is excellent too.  The making of the movie bonus feature is very insightful as a lot of details about the motorcycles, the production and background of the film are brought to light.

The acting is, of course, what it is - a tad contrived in spots, artful in others, but comes together in mildly appalling reminiscences of those smoky campfire scenes of yore - how did we ever survive those years!\n\nAlthough the couch potatoes often think so, the movie ending hostility and brutality wasn't all that contrived, and I can vividly recall being bodily run out of a much needed gas-stop in rural Mississippi back then, just for the crime of showing up on a bike wearing leather (it was November...) -- and even today, not every motel looks kindly on bikes unless they're of the Tupperware barge variety.  Never mind that Easy Rider starts with a drug buy, we were pretty naive back then, the general peaceful wandering of the two says as much about the era, and those of us who were too wiped out to truly remember the 60's, as, say, Star Trek says about the social issues we attempted to wrestle with...\n\nNot real history, but well worth the time, even if it really isn't much of a motorcycle movie...","summary":"A symbol and a memoir of its time...","unixReviewTime":1122854400,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

Usually called \"The original biker movie\", Easy Rider is about two bikers from L.A. who take off on a cross-country trip to New Orleans for Mardi Gras. On the way, they make some new friends, one in particular named George Hansen played by Jack Nicholson, the \"lawyer with the ACLU\". Dennis Hopper won \"Best New Director\" at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival for his work on this movie. This movie also introduced the world to 3 time Academy Award winner Jack Nicholson. Also, this film was the first film that featured actors smoking REAL marijuana on screen. Yes, they were actually stoned, believe it or not. The 35th anniversary DVD is a re-release of the 30th anniversary edition. The only difference is that it features the Easy Rider soundtrack on CD and contains the 80-page British Film Institute Modern Classic book \"Easy Rider\". The transfer is flawless, especially for a 60's film. The 30th anniversary DVD contains a 1.85:1 widescreen presentation with Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby Surround 2.0 soundtracks, and extras such as the documentary \"Easy Rider: Shaking the Cage\", and a commentary by Dennis Hopper. So, take it from me, a 16 year old film buff: This movie is a true classic, and a worthy addition for anyone's film collection.","summary":"The original biker movie!","unixReviewTime":1120003200,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

What could be any more \"biker\" than that?  As they wander with little direction they come across and leave, without recognizing it, the one thing they are searching for.  Near the end of the film one braggs about reaching the American dream while the other finally realizes they were fools and missed their dreams.  The film ends with audience pathos at the sadness of two high ideal losers who could have had it all.  Perhaps this is a commentary on the counter culture of the period.  We had high ideals and recognized the failures of the previous generation, but had trouble pulling it all together ourselves.\n\nNow, everytime I throw my leg across my Harley and head out for a road trip I stick my Steppenwolf CD in and relive the adventure, in 21st century fashion of course.\n\nTRIVIA:\n\nMy favorite song from the dvd, \"Born To Be Wild\" describes motorcycle engines as \"Heavy Metal Thunder\".

I feel that what it did was tell everyone \"Party, and you'll be alright.\" It just didn't gel together enough for me as I feel that the 60's may have been just a complete waste of time. I know one scene that really gripped me was when the main characters go to this hippie commune, and we see a guy who's is obviously stoned out of his mind holding a little baby who's crying, and while it makes the guy disturbed he doesn't do anything about it; Let's face it to me what the father of that baby was wanting was to have someone take that baby away from him so he can get back to the free sex, and the drugs. You see I feel that the movie would've sold me better if it was more geared towards the values the people were trying to hold to back then. I know that the decade was about equality, and world peace, and how everybody wanted them so bad, but the movie looks more on the selfish side of the hippies. With the main characters scoring alot of money from a drug buy, and the carefree style of just traveling along the country without a care in the world. The only character I feel was worth something was played by Jack Nicholson. A lawyer who seemed so dissilousioned with the way things were that he joins Hopper and Fonda for awhile on the trip. I know that during this decade everyone was wondering what's going on? Was the way our parents raised us, and the values they tried to instill in us wrong? This is understandable considering everybody was starting to think more broader. I can't say if it was because of the drugs, or not that caused everyone to start challenging the values of thier parents, but that's where the movie should've been centered. I just can't help, but feel that Fonda's character was right \"We Blew It.\" I know that's what happened with this movie here. A somewhat decent soundtrack, but it's not the masterpiece that everyone feels that it is. I know that this is tough stuff, but I've kept silent about it for 16 years, and it was time to release my feelings on this movie. I feel that it revealed to me that this hippie culture is one of self-indulgence, and escaping responsibilities. It's not about peace, or love. Now there is no resolution as the former hippies have gone on to represent the people they hated, and they've developed a callous attitude that the people they hated had, so what are we to believe? Are we to accept this on blind faith? Well some people may say yes as once again the movie left me feeling with one of the songs from the Blind Faith album \"Do What You Like\".","summary":"Are we to accept this on blind faith?","unixReviewTime":1114646400,"vote":7.0,"image":null}

The hero is an outlaw named Wyatt (Peter Fonda), his partner is Billy (The Kid, presumably, played by the film's director, Dennis Hopper). The sub-narrative is the road, and this time a couple of longhair hippies ride it on motorcycles.\n\n Billy is a loner who can't wait to get out of almost every place that he and Wyatt visit. It's the sense of family, and community, that Billy doesn't feel comfortable with. He's his own man, or wants to be, and community is anathema to his character. Wyatt takes it in stride, and besides, he tells Billy, \"We're eating their food.\"\n\nThe ACLU lawyer, George Hanson (Jack Nicholson) joins the pair and finds inspiration and new joy in life from the road experience. Wyatt and Billy are not just longhairs but, as George tells Billy, \"No, what you represent to them (the hostile locals) is freedom.\"\n\nAmerican Individualism, in 1969, was a classic thread running throughout American history, as was communalism. What was spectacular not only about Easy Rider but the sixties overall was the sense of blending of these two major threads in American history. The tension between Billy the Kid and the Hippie commune can be viewed, among other things, as the cinematic representation of the struggle for true Individualism in the Anglo American psyche. There is no ready resolution to this dichotomous past.\n\n What Easy Rider does is lay out the bare bones of a classic American dilemma and invite the viewer to piece them together. The film is European art-house style. This is no ordinary cowboy movie. Dennis Hopper's directing is not merely brilliant; innovative would be an understatement. Lazslo Kovakcs' cinematography is more than breathtaking; it's magical. A fine classic to own and watch through the years, to think about and enjoy.","summary":"The Cowboy becomes a  Longhair in Dennis Hopper's Masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1114300800,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

Sanderman","reviewText":"_Easy Rider_ is, of course, one of the most important pioneer independent films of the 1960s film movement.  It is the classic biker flick: two guys traveling across the Southwest United States searching for themselves and this country.  Thus, I have a hesitant recommendation.  Few other films that I have seen capture this time period with such accuracy, vision, and emotional power.  However, if you're not into \"road trip\" movies of the 1960s and 1970s, you might be bored by the film's spontaneous dialogue and long visual riding sequences set to great music.\n\nThis film reminded me, in many ways, of the movie _Vanishing Point_, most likely because that film came out two years after _Easy Rider_.  Both depict a lost generation, endlessly searching for something that isn't there, only to be sacrificed for their journey.  The acting in this film is terrific and the meaninglessness of the film's ending is heartbreaking for those audience members who desperately seek to find the same thing that these two free spirits are searching for.\n\nI found the \"Making of\" featurette on this DVD edition to be very informative and really well done.  In fact, it is one of the better featurettes I have seen.  Hopper and Fonda (among others) take us behind the scenes into the magical making of this film and how it all just seemed to flow naturally, largely unscripted.  A word to the wise: you might want to check out the 35th anniversary edition.  While I have heard that the quality of the DVD is not improved, there is a soundtrack CD and a nice booklet for any true fan of the film.  Otherwise, you'll do just fine with this cheaper version.","summary":"The Search for Themselves and This Country","unixReviewTime":1111536000,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

The story is about two hippys (Fonda & Hopper) who buy choppers with cash they've gotten from a drug deal. They ride cross country heading to Louisianna (to Mardi Gras) and on their way meeting different people, visiting a commune of hippys, ending up in jail, going to a brothel, taking acid etc. The ending was disturbing in 1969 and still is, even in these days of non-stop violence in our country. This 35th Anniversary Edition is identical to the regular dvd version of \"Easy Rider\" with the exact same bonus material \"The Making-Of Documentary \"Easy Rider: Shaking The Cage\" (feat. interviews with Fonda, Hopper, etc.) and an audio commentary by Dennis Hopper plus production notes. The bonuses for this 35th Anniversary Edition are a cd which includes eight songs (do not confuse this cd with the actual \"Easy Rider Soundtrack\" as it is not). The songs are \"Born To Be Wild\" - Steppenwolf, \"The Weight\" - Smith, \"Nights In White Satin\" - The Moody Blues, \"Wasn't Born To Follow\" - The Byrds, \"San Francisco Nights\" - Eric Burden And The Animals, \"The Pusher\" - Steppenwolf, \"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\" - Roger McGuinn and \"Get Together\" - The Youngbloods. The 80 page book \"Easy Rider\" by Lee Hill is interesting and includes all you'll ever want to know about the film. The bottom line is, if you already own the regular dvd of \"Easy Rider\" I'd pass on this 35th Anniversary Edition.

It stars Peter Fonda (Wyatt) and Dennis Hopper (Bill) as a pair of drugged out loners who trade a formidable amount of cocaine to `Connection' (Phil Specter) for a sizable amount of cash. Unfortunately, the best that either Wyatt or Bill can think of doing with their new found wealth is to mount a pair of truly sweet cycles and roam the countryside - looking for trouble and, ultimately finding more than they bargained for.  Along the way they enter into an on again off again tempestuous relationship with loose canon George Hanson (Jack Nicholson). Together the boys go through a heap of money, a string of hookers and more than a few ounces of psychedelic trippin'. Nothing seems to help cleanse these reprobates of their rebel without a clue - little boys lost - syndrome. Fueled by a soundtrack that features Steppenwolf's classic \"Born to Be Wild,\" \"Easy Rider\" is anything but, and perhaps, the closest realization of the decade's hippy counterculture ever put on film. That it today seems quaint in its hostility toward authority only serves to reflect just how lost contemporary film culture is.\n\nPreviously, \"Easy Rider\" had been made available through Columbia Tristar in a moderately pleasing DVD transfer. If you're thinking of upgrading to this new 35th Anniversary edition for a better print of the film don't bother. This is the exact same transfer and extras previously made available. The only pluses to this edition are an extra CD of the film's soundtrack and a nicely put together pocket book on the making of the film. But the DVD quality remains the same. As for the quality of the transfer - beginning as it does with several long shots of the boys on their bikes, there is a remarkable amount of resolution to be had in the image. Fine details are nicely realized for the most part and colors, while slightly dated, exhibit a fairly accurate level of contrast and balance. Unfortunately, roughly mid-way through this transfer some strange digital happenings begin to occur, beginning with the flashback sequence in which Wyatt and Bill pick up a pair of hookers. Designed to reflect to an audience that the sequence is going on in the mind of the boys, its exceptionally grainy and slightly out of focus with a bleached out color scheme that is unflattering to say the least. On top of the inherent grain in the print we get an exceptional amount of digital grit which generally makes for a very harsh looking image. Also, the print quality after the flashback - which until its insertion had been moderately pleasing to very nicely done - is increasingly riddled with age related artifacts and grain which degrades the final third of the film's image quality. I really am unable to account for the reason this occurs but it does and is distracting. The audio is 5.1 and, as expected, dated. Dialogue is never natural sounding, obviously manufactured post production studio recordings that are tinny at best. The one kick that the audio gets is in its throbbing rock score that jumps to life with an explosive bass and vibrating treble.","summary":"UNEVEN QUALITY TO TRANSFER REMAINS IN TACT","unixReviewTime":1096156800,"vote":42.0,"image":null}

Gyurisin","reviewText":"I was utterly surprised by this film. I was expecting nothing more than some short scenes of our now-infamous actors smoking marijuana followed by trippy Willy Wonka scenes . Oddly, this did occur, but this film was much more than that. This film should be shown in every American History class in the United States. It not only showed the beauty of the country of which we reside, but it also spoke about the people that reside in it. You know the old saying, \"Guns don`t kill people, people kill people\", well after watching this film, it is a very true statement. We are afraid of what is different. We are a culture that is afraid of change, yet seek it so badly. We are a society of hypocrites, androids, and ignorants. We thrive on the fact that we are the best country in the world, yet somebody shows any disassociation of routine, we are the first to question and get angry. I would dare say that we have moved so far from the 60s that I cannot see why our parents do not cry everyday. Their generations was a free-spirited, mind challenging culture that explored all possibilities no matter the cost. The experience was all they needed as a reward. Now, we are more concerned about money and the family-plan that we sometimes place ourselves on the backburner to life. Wake, eat, and pay the bills. What a sad daily structure that we have. When was the last time you considered the possibility of just jumping on your bike and riding until you hit water? Probably not for a long time ... why? It is called \"bills\" and \"responsibilities\". These are the choices that we chose to make, and for anyone to say that they cannot do it, I would have to challenge. You CAN do anything, it is whether you chose to do it is another question. I wonder what it will be like in another 30 years. Where will we be, and will the idea of individualism be lost? I can't wait to see ...\n\nOutside of the deeply rooted themes of this film, I felt that Hopper (who also directed) knew exactly what he was doing behind the camera. He kept the talking short, the music loud and symbolic, and allowed the background to do the explaining. I loved the fact that we really knew nothing about Fonda or Hopper's characters. It allowed us to relate to them. You could easily add your story into their characters and have the life that you lead and wish to escape. Hopper was able to transform this film from a drug movie to a film about humanity. Fonda, who also helped write the film with Hopper, did a superb job of adding Nicholson's character into the mix.\n\nNicholson represented us, the American public and our love of liquor, football, and lies. I viewed Nicholson as the average American. He drank too much, was the product of a wealthy upbringing, but did not know much about the world. He was sheltered. He never smoked weed (in fact didn't even know what it was when presented to him), never left the state line, and never lived life. He constantly used the expression, \"I have always wanted to ...\". How many times do you hear this a day from either a family member or a co-worker? If you always wanted to do it, why haven't you? So, here we have Hanson, dreaming a dream but never following through, who is traveling with two guys that live the ultimate life and live by their own rules. They are complete opposites, but Hanson's words seemed to remain in my mind for a long time. He reminded me of one of my wife's students today that spoke about freedom. He knew exactly what it was, but never practiced it. Hopper and Fonda were walking (driving most of the time) representations of the word \"freedom\". It is tragic what happens to Harmon, because he (unfortunately) experienced the negative side of freedom ... hatred and fear of the unknown.\n\nThere was one scene that just jumped out at me. It occurs in the diner before the incident later that night where our travelers experience hatred in the country they admire so much. They go from peace and love to fear and hate. It is as if they witnessed night and day. It was frightening to hear the words coming from people in that restaurant. It was not only scary to wonder what was going to happen to our narrators, but mainly that people were speaking that way to fellow citizens. I know that it still occurs today, and it is surprising to me. We bomb a country because they do not follow the same principles that we do, but we need to start asking ourselves this question ... do we need another United States?\n\nGrade: ***** out of *****","summary":"This used to be a helluva good country.","unixReviewTime":1096070400,"vote":19.0,"image":null}

Baldwin","reviewText":"I can recall the first time I saw this film.  Since I was only 6 years old in 1969 I didn't see it on it's original theatrical release.  I saw it on commercial television circa 1980 in the days before video stores and cable TV.  The movie was slotted in a two hour block and they started the film at the \"Born to be Wild\" opening credits segment.  When I saw it on video a few years later I was shocked that Fonda and Hopper made a drug deal prior to their trek to Mardi Gras.  There were other excisions, usually relating to drug use.  Why is this an important film?  Our heroes(?) aren't exactly noble individuals.  There is no real discernible plot.  The direction is haphazard at best(legend has it that director Dennis Hopper was probably stoned to the gills while making this film).  Well, this holds up as a picture of America at a time when social mores were changing.  The cinematography is beautiful.  Most impotantly, this film heralded the entrance of a new force in films, Jack Nicholson.  When Jack comes into the picture as the alcoholic ACLU lawyer the screen just lights up and maintains this aura in every scene he's in.  The scene where he smokes pot and explains the Venutian plot is classic.  The energy of this film deflates once he departs from the film.  I wonder though what relevance this picture has to a more youthful audience whose reference point to Jack is \"The Joker\".  To a younger audience Vietnam and the civil rights movement are things that may or may not have been taught in civics class.  I recommend watching this DVD (If you've seen it before) with Hopper's commentary on because it's a good one.  And the documentary on the disc isn't bad either.","summary":"Is This Film Still Relevant?","unixReviewTime":1096070400,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

There's no doubt that the film was a free-wheeling, pot-smoking, and other illicit drug type of movie that reflects the period that was - the counter-culture, anti-Vietnam War, and anti-establishment 1960s that came from the age of baby boomers. Peter Fonda's \"everything goes\" production was effective in producing a spontaneous film that has allowed continued analysis by scholars and anyone interested in the tumultuous period that was.\n\n The behind the scene commentary was interesting and insightful. Both Dennis Hopper and Fonda offered much discussion about the making of the film that reveals how difficult and how real the actors experienced what was happening in the southern part of the United States during the late '60s, which was much more intense -- bigotry and animosity towards the hippie or \"long-haired\" culture.\n\n The cinematography was excellent. The road scenes were just gorgeous, and the motorcycle drive through New Mexico was quite impressive. The most chilling scene was the ending with the panning out of the camera that gave a somewhat dark feeling that might depict a scene from war torn Vietnam. Or maybe a false sense of hope of a generation that fought for freedom.\n\n Besides the film's look, one cannot forget the soundtrack of the movie. It included a diverse selection of artists, and who can forget the Steppenwolf's overplayed Born To Be Wild, which opens the movie? Other than that, music of The Byrds, Jimi Hendrix, and Bob Dylan captured the film.\n\n The is a film that has survived the times and should be viewed.","summary":"The End of a Decade","unixReviewTime":1091491200,"vote":21.0,"image":null}

Produced and directed by, and starring Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda, and almost stolen by a then-unknown named Jack Nicholson playing a hippie lawyer, \"Easy Rider\" follows its two heroes across some of the most stunning scenery in the Southwest as they head towards Louisiana in search of \"freedom\", whatever that means.  \"Easy Rider\" not only brings us two (or three, counting Nicholson) of society's dropouts, we also meet a community of hippies, some narrow-minded small-town lawmen, and some rednecks in Louisiana who seem to have a more-than-passing relationship to Neanderthals.  We wonder if the film's perhaps unwitting message is that the search for meaningless \"freedom\" results in meaningless and wanton death and destruction.  More than any film of its time, \"Easy Rider\" caught the mood of the late 1960s in America and the fear of the \"establishment\" for society's rebels.  It may be of its own time, but its timeless rejection of mindless conformity echoes down to us.","summary":"Two for the road","unixReviewTime":1085529600,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

I had almost completely forgotten the plot, except for the ending.\n\nI did not grow up here, but I have lived in the deep south all of my adult life, and as usual the actors in this film have the stereotypical phony Southern \"accents\" -- even Dolly Parton has been too long in Tinseltown.  And even here the accents change somewhat (NC being different from GA, which is again different from an LA parish).  I understand that the rest of America cannot hear it, but native southerners pick right up on the forced sound of the actors.\n\nThe other thing that bothered me this go-round was the obvious change of seasons in the story (Easter, Halloween, Christmas, and back to Easter over several years) -- all while the native foliage is in the full bloom of summer.  We do have the four distinct seasons here, and our deciduous trees all turn colors and are then bare by late Fall every year.  However, I don't remember one outdoor scene where the trees were anything but fully green.  It gives the impression to the viewer that the entire movie was shot start-to-finish in about eight weeks.  The IMdB website of this film lists at least 34 shots where there was some flub or mis-continuity, but never mentions the obvious lack of outdoor seasons.\n\nOther than that, a sad and funny film, with a wonderful title theme from Georges Delerue.","summary":"Hollywood chick schtick","unixReviewTime":1372723200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Produced on a very low budget and set in the late 60's it was, in my opinion, the first movie to really capture a particularly interesting moment in time.  While many films sort of used the notion of the late 60's, drugs, sex, rebellion, idealism, as a means to make money, this seemed really the first film to accurately reflect a realistic image of the time period with an unflinching eye.\nPeter Fonda and Dennis Hopper play Wyatt, or Captain America, and Billy, two free type spirits who, after a making quite a bit of money through a sale of drugs, decide to hit the road and drive cross country to Mardi Gras.  Along the way, they pick up George Hanson, a southern lawyer, played by Jack Nicholson.\nWhile watching this movie, you may get a sense that it is sort of a western, with the western landscapes and the main characters riding 'iron' horses.  This was the intention of the filmmakers, especially the director, Dennis Hopper.  One of my favorite scenes was at the beginning, right before Wyatt and Billy are about to embark on their trip, Wyatt removes his watch and throws it on the ground.  This symbolized a sense of throwing off the constraints of the old world and an effort to embrace true freedom, if there is such a thing.\nNicholson tends to steal the scenes he is in, and gives a particularly wonderful piece about what freedom is, and why people are so afraid of it.  He sort of represented to me one who has been fed many misconceptions about the individuals and movement Wyatt and Billy represent, but once in their company, finds that much of what he has been told may not be true.  A sort of individual caught between the generations.\nThe film is dated, but that didn't detract anything for me.  The only scene I really didn't care for was when Wyatt, Billy, Mary (Toni Basil), and Karen (Karen Black) drop acid in a Louisiana cemetery and proceed to trip for an extended period of time.\nAlong with wonderful performances, much credit must go to the cinematographer, as the landscapes are beautiful, especially the wide shots of the western scenery.  They are truly breathtaking.  And the music used was exceptionally good, fitting each scene and helping to create the proper mood throughout the film.\nThe movie presented here looks excellent, in anamorphic wide screen, and includes a commentary by Dennis Hopper.  Also included is a wonderful 'Making of' featurette called Easy Rider:  Shaking the Cage which really helps to illustrate all that went into making this film.  The production, at time, often reflected the turbulent times of when the film was made, and helps to give more flavor to the movie, really enhancing the overall effect.  All in all, Easy Rider is a wonderful slice of outsider Hollywood that captured the true essence of an exceptionally turbulent time in America.","summary":"\"Helmut?

That means it's great, right?  Well, not necessarily.  It's an incredibly amateurish and uneven flick, with gaping holes in the plot, in the dialog, in the editing.  The performances are (quite literally) stoned and dazed.  But in this birds nest of oddness there are enough true gems to put it firmly in the forefront of classic cinema.  These are the scenes we've all seen before: the famous \"This used to be a hell of a good country\" scene at the campfire comes to mind.  That soliloquy alone is worth the price of the DVD.  I think it all boils down to the fact that there is basically nothing worth getting too sentimental about from this time period.  The crazy crack pot adolescence of the American nation doesn't bear too much scrutiny or it becomes painfully obvious that if you weren't stoned, you didn't get it, and you won't get it now.  In other words, you have to believe it to see it.  I do believe some of it, sometimes, and this movie helps me glimpse that small part.  But it also shows me how painfully vaccuous and dreary and empty and pointless so much of the youth counterculture truly was.\n Any way, good flick, and it rings with an historical authenticity that is almost unequaled.  Its great contribution is that it was made at the peak of the era, and commented on that era very eloquently.  Usually the good commentary doesn't come along for many years, but Easy Rider pretty much hits the nail on the head.  Plus the bikes are great.\n I highly recommend a very similar film called \"Vanishing Point\", which is a better film, and another dose of very authentic and high-proof 60's\/70's nihilism.

The plot is simple enough, 2 hippies (Fonda and Hopper) make one big score dealing cocaine, buy 2 fat hogs and saddle up to ride down to Mardi Gras. Well, along the way the boys encounter friends and enemies (mostly the latter) until they end up in jail for parading without a permit! Enter Nicholson...Jack plays a drunk ACLU lawyer named George who comes from a priviledged background. But, he can relate to these longhairs and in fact has more than a little in common with their world view. I don't want to give away any more of the plot as you must watch to be shocked, but let's just say it doesn't end pretty. Peter Fonda's Captain America character is a pure optimist and the embodiment of what America used to be. He is accepting, caring and fiercely original. Fonda turns in a strong understated performance. Hopper's character is more of the stereotypical hippie, complete with paranoid rants and goofy behavior. He's definitely not the straight man here and his performance is too over the top. Nicholson steals the show even for the brief amount of time he's actually in the film...a truly great performance. Easy Rider shares a commonality with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas in fact the two plots are basically interchangable: 2 friends set out in search of America and couldn't find it anywhere. There are a few problem's like the acid trip scene which is ridiculously overdone and the ending which paints an overly pessimistic America to come. But, in the end there's no denying the simple genius here. The landscapes are breathtaking and so is the soundtrack (The Band, Grateful Dead, Hendrix, etc.). This is one trip you must take.

Easy Rider (Directed by Dennis Hopper) is the story of two hippie bikers who take a trip on their motorcycles down to the Mardi-Gras festival in New Orleans.

The ending of the film is profoundly pessimistic about the prospects for freedom and independence.\nThe film is certainly critical of the intolerant \"establishment\" (which nevertheless prevails), but if there is one character who does smell of roses, it is the farmer who takes the boys in for the night and who, says Fonda, should be proud simply for living off the land.\nFor my money this makes Easy Rider ahead, rather than behind its times. It's also rooted in a number of great cinematic traditions, aside from the Road Movie genre which it helped to invent. I like the idea (expressed in a review below) that this is a latter day western, even down to the character's names, Wyatt and Billy. Also, were you to draw a line between Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid and Thelma & Louise, it would intersect Easy Rider.\nThe performances of the cast are delightful - Nicholson's is rightly feted, and Hopper's is very Dennis Hopper - fans of Apocalypse Now will recognise this style in which Hopper doesn't really act so much as simply looning around - here in total contrast to Fonda's studied coolness, which holds the film together, reinforced with a cracking soundtrack (in this regard also, Easy Rider was well ahead of its time).\nIf you fancy a dash of counterpoint, try watching Easy Rider back to back with David Lynch's stunning recent work The Straight Story - as a compare and contrast job, I think they'd make a fascinating study.","summary":"Get your motor running","unixReviewTime":1024790400,"vote":13.0,"image":null}

(LA? yes, Los Angeles) who go to a La Contenta bar, whether it is really in Mexico or not you be the judge, and buy a good deal of coke from a dealer.  They sell it to a guy right next to an airport and then starts the triumphant tunes The Pusher and Born to Be Wild by Steppenwolf as they go on the road with a load of money in Fonda's gastank.  On the road, they run into an understanding farmer, a quirky commune leader, a commune with some really strange folks (reminds me why I occasionaly indulge in the cannibus culture but not communism), two nice girls posing as skinny dippers, a parade, an ACLU attorney who says \"Lord have mercy, is that what that is?\" when Fonda passes a joint, witty and deadly southern folk and estranged prostitutes.\nFonda and Hopper represented something amazing to the generation that they were about, and that's what made the box office bucks; that and Jack Nicholson in one of his abloslute most memorable roles as the drunkard ACLU attorney George Hanson.

On a budget of no more than half a million dollars, the director\/producer team of Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda somehow captured the alienation that a lot of young people felt about America during that turbulent time.\nHopper and Fonda are, respectively, Billy and Wyatt, two Harley Davidson-riding hippie bikers who, after making a big drug score with a big-time dope dealer (played by record mogul Phil Spector), embark on a journey across America, ostensibly to enjoy a good time in New Orleans during Mardi Gras.  Along the way, they encounter, initially, the more idealistic side of America in a New Mexico hippie commune and a farm in Arizona.  But when they get into Texas, their joining a parade illegally gets them tossed into a redneck jail.  Not long after, though, they are bailed out by a very inebriated lawyer by the name of George Hanson (Jack Nicholson, in the role that made him a household word in Hollywood).\nNicholson cheerfully agrees to go along with them on their Harley sojourn.  Along the way, Hopper complains to him about how he and Fonda are constantly harrassed by the law and unable to get even a \"second rate motel\" to sleep in.  Nicholson gingerly explains to the pair that it's not just the length of the hair that bothers people; it's what they represent--individual freedom: \"They'll talk to you and talk to you about freedom, but when they see someone with real freedom, it's gonna scare them.\"  One night, Louisiana rednecks savagely beat and kill Nicholson.  It is at this point that EASY RIDER starts getting bleaker in tone.\nFonda and Hopper arrive in New Orleans at the height of Mardi Gras, and cavort around an Orleans cemetary with two hookers (Toni Basil, Karen Black) during an acid trip.  But dismayed by what they've seen, they beat a hasty retreat and continue east.  Fonda realizes the futility of their journey now.  He tells Hopper, \"We blew it.\"  Their journey comes to an end on a Florida highway when Hopper flicks off two rednecks in a truck, who then proceed to blow both him and Fonda off the road.\nUnquestionably dated to a large extent, particularly in the strange editing of certain sequences and the acid trip, which looks less avant garde and more amateurish, EASY RIDER nevertheless has its merits.  The soundtrack is one of those merits, with 1960s classics like Steppenwolf's \"Born To Be Wild\" and the Band's \"The Weight\", and countryish tracks like \"Wasn't Born To Follow\" (the Byrds) and \"Don't Bogart Me\" (Fraternity of Man).  The other is, of course, Nicholson's star-making performance as George Hanson.  Before this, Nicholson was just a B-grade actor.  But his often-uproarious and, later, thoughtful performance here cemented his reputation as a top-notch movie star forever.\nFeaturing very fine cinematography by Laszlo Kovacs, who later went on to do portions of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, EASY RIDER is a flawed film by today's standards, but in its day was a groundbreaking film that helped change Hollywood forever.  If one can get by its being highly dated, it still works as a period piece.","summary":"Looking For America...And Not Finding It","unixReviewTime":1019174400,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

I expected this movie to be great because it was called a counterculture classic and topped many people's lists of the best film of the 1960's. In my opinion, Easy Rider is a case of don't believe everything you read.\nSure, the movie has its good points. The music is fantastic. The songs are all very memorable and suit the road theme, styles of the film and the time in which it is set very well. Many of the songs of the movie have become classics since the films release. Easy Rider is also shot gorgeously, with heaps of great sunset shots and motorcycle journeys.\nThe performances in the movie are also very good. Jack Nicholson is the stand out as the innocent comic relief Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda meet when they go to jail. Nicholson deserved another Oscar for this role! Hopper clearly put a lot of effort into the film being a writer, director and lead actor, but his continuous \"man's\" and hippie references annoyed the heck out of me, as did his monologues about what he \"sees\" after he takes drugs. Peter Fonda was hailed as the leading actor of the movie but he really doesn't say that much and he has very little facial expression. His acting definitely got better.\nThere was also way too many drugs in this movie. In the film, this is basically the story: these 2 guys take drugs, encounter people, take drugs, make the people they encounter take drugs, take some drugs, sleep, take a couple more drugs, have sex, and then take drugs. And apparently this story is all about \"freedom\" according to Dennis Hopper. Yeah right. Also, Easy Rider doesn't present any ideas why or why not the characters should be doing this. Why are they doing it in the first place? Is taking drugs a way to make people free and express freedom? No. I found the use of drugs both pointless and excruciatingly unrealistic in this film.\nSo, the movie does have its good points - the cinematography, bikes and Jack Nicholson - but not enough to overcome the whole pointlessness of the entire production. This is one big disappointment for me, and I can't believe such a film that was hailed as a \"classic\" could be so banal and stupid.\nMY GRADE: C-","summary":"Wholly overrated","unixReviewTime":1017792000,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

However it is more than that\nI admit when I first saw EASY RIDER I was not too thrilled but after seeing again and looking at it more closely I realized how great a movie it is. It is a true experience of the uncensored sixties. How the life of a hippie really was. His experiences with drugs and love and rejection from society.\nWhen you look at this movie it seems really simple so why was it so successful? Well I can only say in my opinion that this movie had to be made in 1969 to be successful. If it was made today it just would not be the same.\nThat is what makes EASY RIDER so special. The fact that it is the ultimate sixties experience. Also with Jack Nicholson, Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper and a awesome soundtrack with Jimi Hendrix, Steppen Wolf ,The Byrds and The Band how could this movie be bad? In conclusion EASY RIDER is one of the groovy, trippy, American classics that is just down right cool!

A counter-culture rebel who never could quite come to terms with the Vietnam era government he so distrusted. Not surprisingly, his portrayal of \"Billy\", the frantic companion to Peter Fonda's \"Wyatt\" is the constantly racing heart of Easy Rider, one of the most important films of the late sixties.\nFilmed the year after the summer of love had ended, Rider is one of the few true portraits of the cultural landscape of that turbulent era. The mellow Fonda always represents a generations quest for a simple kind of peace while Hopper, who also directed, is the fatal drive towards a futile end, always pulling away from the obvious path. They ride their custom choppers like two cowboys headed through the wild west. It's an obvious analogy but a meaningful one, their dangers were no less great as we find out. Although a notoriously frazzled production, great performances (notably Jack Nicholson), and a supurb use of some of the great rock road anthems of the day help create something fascinating, if quite dated. Of course, whether you lived the era or not, today the movie stands as a great historical representation of the mood of a country during one of America's strangest periods. Hopper's direction seems subdued by contrast to his performance (outside of a depressing and sureal trip and acid trip through Mardi Gras and a rather blunt ending) although perhaps less so considering his admitted, much longer initial cut, before leveler heads prevailed. There is an obvious fly by night amateurish quality overall but It's still a good film, maybe even great in certain ways. Cultural sign posts like this are rare. Rarer still to be made by the ones who lived it.","summary":"A classic western?","unixReviewTime":999561600,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

Now I am fascinated by it, and its controvery is far more apparent to me. My best recomendation to anyone who is going to see this for the first time and did not live in the 60s is to learn more about the time period first. That way, when you see Henry Fonda stuffing money into his gas tank so he can buy drugs on his road trip, you will realize that the mainstream reaction was \"Oh my lord, how can someone do such a thing, like actually plan out that they know that they will want drugs in the near future.\" And there is even more to that shot besides what I have tried to articulate. So there is no sure fire way to explain this movie to anyone too young to remember when it first came out. However, if one makes the effort (and not an extreme one is needed) the times and feelings of the 60s can become intelligible. I can honestly say that now being able to watch this movie and understand it is a most rewarding experience for me, so all I can say is I hope it can be for others like myself.","summary":"not so ez getting","unixReviewTime":997660800,"vote":null,"image":null}

It also was a trailblazer in the independent film market.  There had other hippie movies before, but they were mostly bad films about drug use.  Easy Rider tells the story of two hippies, played by Dennis Hopper & Peter Fonda, who motorcycle across the country from California to New Orleans for Mardi Gras.  They had just made a big drug score and are using that money for the trip.  Along the way, they stay at a commune in the desert, get caught up in a dispute in a small town and of course take alot of drugs.  There is a scene in a New Orleans graveyard that visualizes an acid trip.  Jack Nicholson shows up as a drunk who is constantly being jailed.  He rides along with Mr. Hopper & Mr. Fonda and meets an untimely death. The role garnered Mr. Nicholson an Oscar nomination and catapulted him to stardom.  The film is visually pretty and well shot and they make great use of rock songs as no other movie had beforehand. The film was also a commentary by hippies about hippies.  It is supposed to show that hippies are just peace loving people who embody the freedom America is supposed to give people.  They are unfairly persecuted by small-minded people who judge them by the length of their hair.  At the time, this was all groundbreaking stuff.  The problem is that the film hasn't aged well in the 30 years since it's release.  It is still cemented back in 1969 and now is just a relic from that time.  The film's power should be more judged for the doors it opened up for other maverick film makers like Martin Scorcese, Peter Bogdanovich and other later ones like Quentin Tarantino and Spike Lee.  Before Easy Rider, you had to play within the system.  After it became a huge success, you could go underground and get daring pictures released.","summary":"Counterculture Touchstone","unixReviewTime":981331200,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

It took the independent film movement--practiced for so long by Roger Corman and others--and thrust it forward into the spotlight and, eventually, the mainstream. Made for under a million dollars, \"Easy Rider\" eventually grossed close to fifty, and opened Hollywood's eyes to a whole new area of potential profits. The American film was never to be the same again.\nThe story is a simple one: two hippies (Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper) riding their motorcycles cross-country to New Orleans for Mardi Gras. Along the way they visit a commune, meet some girls, go to a whorehouse, and do lots and lots of drugs. They also get thrown in jail where they meet an alcoholic lawyer, terrifically played by Jack Nicholson in his breakthrough role. The trio then continues on together towards New Orleans, stopping occasionally to smoke some grass and philosophize about life. Eventually, they have a series of strange and violent conflicts with some rednecks that lead to the movie's rather abrupt conclusion.\nThe best aspects of the film are the on-target performances and Laszlo Kovacs' stark cinematography. Also of note is a stunning, hallucinatory montage of an acid trip, complete with a bizarre Catholic motif. The writing (by Fonda, Hopper, and Terry Southern) is strictly ordinary, providing only the barest structure to hang the story on, punctuated by mostly improvised dialog.\nWhat made \"Easy Rider\" different from the ordinary Hollywood films of its time was its rebellious spirit and youthful exuberance, complemented by its loud hippie rock soundtrack. Directed by Hopper and produced by Fonda, \"Easy Rider\" was the first movie of its kind to reach such a wide audience and gain mainstream acceptance. Its casual portrayal of drug use and confrontational defiance of authority combined to make \"Easy Rider\" an anthem for young people. Although the film today seems inevitably dated, it still stands as an enduring emblem of its age.","summary":"Breakthrough Independent Film","unixReviewTime":959040000,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

This ofcourse is due to its cultural and box office impact rather then the quality of the film itself. Today the film is merely a curio-item, but as a film, it just doesn't work. Witness  for example the ludicrous dialogue, when a farmer invites Fonda and Hopper  to eat with his family, there is a close-up of Fonda's face as he says  \"Its great thing for a man to live off the land, you should be  proud.\" Please, this sounds like a public service commercial for some  farmers union. Hopper as a director has this highly annoying gimmick of  falshing frames of the next scene twice before actually moving onto it, and  he doesn't do it once but throughout the film. Now I'm aware that this  gimmickry might have been revolutionary back in the sixties, but now it  only breaks the flow of a film that is already hard to sit through. The  movie consists of endless shots of Fonda and Hopper on their bike, and not  much else, but it does however recieve a major jolt with Jack Nicholson's  arrival, he briefly awakens this movie out of its slumber. Unfortunatly  he's not on for long, and we're back to Fonda and Hopper on bikes. The  movie then ends in an extended acid trip which despite being completely  pointless is far more entertaining then the rest of this tepid film. Watch  this if you're a serious film buff and want to know what the hoopla is  about, but once you've gotten through it once, I doubt you'll have it in  you to sit through it again.","summary":"A Bad Acid Trip","unixReviewTime":952646400,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

Despite the implication of women being as fragile as magnolias, their steely strength pulls them together, and they blossom with hope in the midst of tragedy.\n In this film adaptation of Harling's 1987 play based on the loss of his sister, the main area of the congregations of the principles is the home-based beauty salon run by Truvy Jones(played by the always sunny, lively, and amiable Dolly Parton)in a parish of Natchitoches, Louisiana.\n The story begins on the wedding day of Shelby Eatenton(Georgia Native, Julia Roberts, right in her element playing a Southerner) and Jackson Latcherie(Dylan McDermott). M'Lynn Eatenton (Sally Field) is hustling about readying herself and everyone for the occasion while her husband Drum(Tom Skerritt)and their two sons Tommy and Jonathan(Knowl Johnson and Jonathan Ward)are lighting firecrackers to clear the trees of birds that might literally mess up Shelby's wedding reception. There is their customary strife with the town grande dame Louisa\"Ouiser\" Boudreaux(Shirley MacLaine) before M'Lynn and Shelby arrive to have their hair done at Truvy's.\n  Truvy's newly hired assistant, Annelle Dupuy(an initially and uncharacteristically mousy-looking Daryl Hannah) arrives amid a personal crisis. Shelby generously invites her to the wedding, but in a bit of forshadowing,suffers an attack of hypoglycemia in the salon chair due to the stress and excitement of her big day. Family friend Clariee Belcher (Olympia Dukakis)lends a hand during the attack. After the episode passes, the wedding day is beautiful,and we are even treated to dancing with a little regional flair, and the view of the armadillo-shaped groom's cake made by the groom's aunt Fern (Ann Wedgeworth), although M'Lynn expresses concern about the diabetic Shelby's desire to have a child, and the concerned expression on her face is highly visible as the couple leave for their honeymoon.\n Over time, we see the evolution of the characters as the widowed Clairee, who has remained cheerful despite the loss of a husband and son in two different wars, comes into her own, encouraged by Shelby, buying a local radio station and working as a sports reporter; Annelle becomes a bit more stylish, and after a period as a wild woman, settles down with Sammy DeSoto(Kevin J. O'Connor), whom she met at Shelby's wedding, and becomes a Sunday School teacher in addition to working for Truvy. Shelby also inspires the cantankerous Ouiser to re-acquaint herself with one Owen Jenkin (Bill McCutcheon). Later, Truvy's husband Spud(Sam Shepard) will have a generous surprise for her.\n Holidays seem to mark times of relevant events for the characters. Shelby's pregancy is announced at Christmastime, and the apprehensive M'Lynn, still worried about the effect pregnancy will have on Shelby's health, is comforted by the others as they try to remain hopeful.\n The baby is born on Independance Day, and we meet Jackson Jr. as he celebrates his first birthday surrounded by his family.\n M'Lynn and Shelby, who now lives in another town, keep another appointment at Truvy's as they make the announcement that M'Lynn will donate a kidney to her daughter, amid gossip about what local beauty queen Nancy-Beth Marmillion(Janine Turner), prominently on display during the Christmastime festivities, was up to with a local politician afterwards.\n But on Halloween, Shelby collapses into a coma due to kidney failure as her helpless toddler, clad in a Halloween costume cries for his mother. Jackson finds her when he comes home.\n M'Lynn rushes to the hospital. But there is no hope. After the life support machine is turned off, she rushes home, leaving her husband, sons, and son-in-law in the waiting room, making a mournful solo trek across the bayou to collect her grandson from Aunt Fern.--A journey towards her own personal consolation.\n M'Lynn acknowledges that the women are handling this crisis better than the men were. The religious Annelle tries to make sense of the tragedy, stating that in death, Shelby is in a better place, and better able to take care of those she loved.\n M'Lynn only partially accepts this, but rages in pain, wondering how her grandson will ever know how wonderful his mother was or what she went through for him. But as time goes on, it is apparent that he will know through his loving grandmother and her friends, who will guard and support Shelby's most precious legacy.\n We depart from this amiable region of Natchitoches on a sunny and rather symbolic Easter Sunday as the pregnant Annelle leaves for the hospital to deliver another Shelby into the world. As life renews itself on that day, of all days, we can sense that a kind young woman is beaming down light on all those who loved her and we can somehow feel satisfied with that.","summary":"What a Grandson Will Know....","unixReviewTime":1315958400,"vote":null,"image":null}

The main story line revolves around a young woman who is willing to risk her life and die in order to produce a baby. Because the central goal of a woman's life is to make babies. Unless you can fulfill this goal, you are incomplete. So of course, the only reasonable thing to do is for a woman literally to kill herself in an attempt to produce a baby.\n\nThere are many other female characters who are mainly dedicated to endless hen-like clucking around the protagonist's attempts to have a baby, as well as interminable conversations about hair-styles, weddings, husbands, etc. In Steel Magnolias, we see women of all generations inhabiting a world of their own. It's a world of babies, beauty, and homemaking. It's a world of things that the patriarchal societies always mark as exclusively female. Men are supposed to be detached from these \"womanly\" interests and concerns, while women have no interest in the pursuits of men. The view of genders as profoundly divided by an unbridgeable chasm of difference is patriarchal.\n\nWhy this film has been hailed as a feminist classic and has become a perennial staple of \"Feminist Film\" courses is beyond me.","summary":"A boring, badly made patriarchal melodrama","unixReviewTime":1279152000,"vote":12.0,"image":null}

Peter Travers of Rolling Stone says, \"The ladies are live wires. Just stand back and watch them set off sparks\".\n While filming Christmas scenes in 100 degree weather in the summer of 1988, Dolly was sitting on the sidelines quietly waiting for her call from the director. Totally made up in heavy sweater and a wig, Dolly was approached by Julia Roberts who, with the exception of Dolly, was complaining about the heat. She said to Dolly, \"how can you just sit there and not complain about the heat?\", to which Dolly stated, \"when I was a little girl I wanted to be two things, rich and famous, and now that I'm both of those things I'm not gonna complain\". Julia was speechless! Another good quote from Dolly too was when the director, Herbert Ross, told her she couldn't act. Dolly exclaimed, \"Shoot I know I can't act. You didn't hire me so I could act.

Sure, as a guy I can understand why those three things are appealing to my gender (although I am far from a sports fan) but I have never been one to hide my deeper feelings or emotions.  I cry whenever I want to; I have deep and meaningful conversations with my male friends and I definitely watch whatever it is that I want to regardless of the intended fan base.\n\nI say this, not because I think that this is a particularly good movie but because this seems to be a popular movie that men feel unabashedly ashamed in either watching or enjoying or, god forbid, crying at.\n\nThe film tells the story of a group of women who frequent the same hair salon and become a central part of each others lives over the years.  There is M'Lynn, the kind hearted mother who only wants what is best for her daughter Shelby, who just so happens to be a serious diabetic.  There is Truvy, who owns the salon, and Annelle, her new employee with a background no one is too sure about.  There is the loudmouthed Ouiser and her loyal friend Clairee.\n\nTogether they make for one lively bunch.\n\nThe film mostly focuses on M'Lynn and Shelby as they struggle to come to terms with Shelby's growing independence.  Shelby wants to get married and have children, but the doctors have warned her that childbirth will not be a smart move for someone in her condition.  M'Lynn wants to allow her daughter to live her own life, but she also is the mother and mothers always know what is best for their children; right?\n\nThe film is tragically clich&eacute;d, which probably adds to the memorable factor, since we've seen it all before, but it takes away from the originality and my personal overall appreciation of the film.  It's also very heavy handed, and it's not always smooth about it either.  The acting is a bit spotty, sometimes so over the top it's annoying and other times so grounded in itself that it is stunningly superb.\n\nLet's look at the two opposite ends of the spectrum; Shirley MacLaine and Sally Field.  Two of my favorite actresses of all time spar off and only one is the victor; Field.  Sally Field delivers what may be her finest performance ever, delving deep into the maternal spectrum of this woman's very being.  M'Lynn aches to see her daughter live a full life, but she cannot look past the fact that a full life may very well kill her.  It's heartbreaking to say the least.  Shirley MacLaine, who may even be a better actress as a whole, is ridiculously overacting throughout this film.  Her mannerisms are all over the place and her characters comedic timing borders on annoying.  It's shameful, which is sad, because I love her.\n\nOlympia Dukakis is stunning here, Dolly Parton is fun and Daryl Hannah is effectively nave, even if neither do a whole lot to be remembered for.  Julia Roberts was nominated for an Oscar for her performance, and was the favorite to win (although she lost) but her performance is decent at best, never really investing itself as deeply as Field's.  She does a fine job, but nothing spectacular.\n\nSo, did this movie make me cry?  Yes, it did, and I am not ashamed to say that.  The ending is such a heartbreaker, and Field is so convincing in her tragic portrayal that anyone who doesn't cry is made of stone, really.  Is the movie really as amazing as many make it out to be?  No, not really.  It works to an extent and sports a beautiful performance but its own clich&eacute;s and spotty collective ensemble tear it down a few notches and keep it from being the classic many want it to be.  See it for Field, for she is heaven-sent, but don't expect too much from the film as a whole.","summary":"I saw it, I cried; I'm not ashamed to admit it...","unixReviewTime":1231200000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Fowler","reviewText":"At the moment I can think of no other film featuring four academy award winning actresses, and Darryl Hannah and Dolly Parton hold up well in this ensemble featuring Oscar-winners Julia Roberts, Sally Field, Olympia Dukakis and Shirley Maclaine.\n\nSteel Magnolias is an artifice - a fictional Southern Universe where all the women are strong and funny and compassionate and lovable despite their flaws.  It's the kind of fictional universe where the characters are named M'Lynn, Truvy, Ouiser (pronounced \"Wheezer\"), Annelle, Clairee and Shelby.  In my extensive travels in the south I have met one Shelby, and no real people with these other names.  I also have not met a Drum, Spud or Jackson. But the writing, which is funny from the opening wedding to the final funeral, is crisp and delivered with relish by the above-mentioned crew.\n\nNow, part of the artifice in the film is that men are little more than accessories to the lives of our starring six women.  The script, by Robert Harling from his script, gives us only a spattering of men who are all a good bit dumber, less caring, less compassionate and more boring than the women.  Tom Skerrit, Sam Shepard and Dylan McDermot play the husbands of Field, Parton and Roberts respectively, but the screenplay makes them all disposable.\n\nAt the center of the story are Sally Field's M'Lynn, who is mother to Julia Roberts' Shelby, who is marrying Jackson.  Everyone gets their hair done at Truvy's (played by Dolly), but the chief currency at the beauty parlor is gossip, traded with most enthusiasm by widowed Clairee (played by Dukakis) and with most bark and a little bite by Ouiser (Maclaine).  As the film opens Darryl Hannah's Annelle has blown into town not sure if she's married or not (good fodder for the gossipers) and ready to put her fledgeling beauty technician skills to work at Truvy's, just before Shelby's wedding.\n\nThe spark in the film comes from the interactions of these female characters who have known each other in this small town all their lives.  They know about Shelby's diabetes and about Ouiser's wang-dang and flapdoodle, and interest is generated seeing these characters knowingly dance around one another.\n\nThere are no crimes - of the heart or otherwise.  No murders.  No secret affairs.  The Lord's name is taken in vain a few times, but Annelle lets `em know she don't appreciate it.\n\nThis world is fictional, but so are Never-Never Land, Middle Earth and most other worlds we visit in film, so as a native southerner I'm able to reconcile things like accents: Dolly is pretty stuck playing women with an East Tennessee twang, and to be honest I found Julia's accent no better than Olympia's.  You'd think for two Oscar-winning actresses that the one from Georgia would have a better Louisiana drawl than the one from Massachusetts, but there ya' go.\n\nThe Mrs. Tells me I too often am critical of films that stretch my suspension of disbelief.  This one stretched me, but only a little, and I liked the movie overall.  The Mrs. Loves it.","summary":"Girl's Club in Louisiana","unixReviewTime":1222819200,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

The plot revolves around a beauty parlor where the main characters go to become beautiful. The character of the beauty parlor owner is played by Dolly Parton.\n\nAt Truvy's Beauty Parlor in Louisiana we learn all about these close group of friends and soon learn the secrets these women carry in their hearts.\n\nM'Lynn, played by Sally Fields is married to Drum Eatenton, a playful man who at the start of the film is busy shooting birds that are perched on a tree on his property. This drives us all crazy, especially those of us that firmly believe on the protection of the environment... but they have a very special reason as a motive.\n\nDaughter of Drum and M'Lynn Eatenton, Shelby, superbly played by Julia Roberts is getting married and we soon see these women go to visit the beauty parlor in preparation for the big day. Annelle Dupuy Desoto, played by Daryl Hannah, has just joined the staff as a hair dresser, \"a glamour technician,\" and soon the women are hard at finding all about \"her past\" because even though she is \"the sweetest thing\" just live through puberty and you must have a past.\n\nOuiser Boudreaux, a bitter, ill tempered and outspoken lady, played deserving of an award by Shirley MacLaine joins the women and she puts Annelle through a rather fun and entertainment interview.\n\nClairee, a recently widowed woman, played by Olympia Dukakis is the only person that truly understand Ouiser... and the give and take of these women is so endearing and captivating, that we soon find ourselves enchanted by this movie.\n\nAs the movie develops we find ourselves involved in the pain and heartache of the challenges these women face. We cried, we laughed, and we walked away wishing that our town would have the close relationships these families share. Indeed a movie worthy of becoming part of any collection.

Having never seen the movie, we rented it as soon as we got back home. Everyone had a reason for watching it in two segments--mine was my sense that this was one of the \"cutest\" movies I'd ever seen, and I'd had quite enough \"cute\" lately, especially after sitting through Will Smith in \"Hitch\". The accents and the caricatures of the characters were all so thick that it reminded me of The Beverly Hillbillies, though more embarrassing than funny. One \"Hillbillies-like\" moment that pretty funny was the few non-female characters' effort to shoot some \"crows\" out of a tree so that they won't \"**** all over the reception\". Their creative use of a crossbow is a classic.\n\nSad to say there isn't much else classic in a story that is at the same time saccharine and maudlin. There was also some choppiness between scenes (as the movie was adapted from a play that never left the beauty shop). I can think of two scenes in particular--one where the town-big wig Clairee (played by the noted-Southern belle Olympia Dukasis) buys the local radio station so that she can do the color commentary on the local football games (the scene features the same guy filmed bare from the back waist-and-lower view as he walks in front camera in the locker room three times.) In another scene, the Darryl Hannah (hard to recognize) committed Christian character argues with her boyfriend over his repeated taking of the Lord's name in vain. Neither scene has any impact on the rest of the story.\n\nDolly Parton is her usual big hair, big smile, big **** self as the lead hairdresser. Shirley MacLaine has a very unsympathetic character as the Eatonton's (Julie and Sally, and family) ill-tempered neighbor. The male characters are more or less wasted, especially the estimable Sam Shepard, who spends most of the film underneath a car, or sitting lifelessly in front of a TV.\n\nThe movie improved from the seemingly endless wedding prep and wedding of the first half to the second half, which became more dramatic. Sally Field has a pretty good scene near the end, she and the story make you think a little about the motives of the main character (Julia Roberts as Shelby).\n\nOverall, I thought that Steel Magnolias was a relatively embarrassing depiction of life in the beautiful town of Natchitoches, LA. Given that the locals seemed not to mind too much, I may be overreacting. They even showed us where the truck made an illegal left turn in the final scene.","summary":"Reporting from Location","unixReviewTime":1162512000,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

Holder","reviewText":"This movie is wonderful for its simple story of life, enhanced by a rare combination of heavyweight talent.  The characters seem to jump off the screen because they are so homey and natural, and the deep philosophical thought into which so many movies of this type sink is almost completely absent, leaving something readily understandable and enjoyable that allows you to laugh or cry freely.\nIt is unusual for so many famous stars to appear in one film.  Julia Roberts is listed after many of the other names, though today she is one of the most popular and highly paid actors in the world.  Sally Field plays Julia Roberts' fretful mother, always concerned about her daughter, but a balanced concern.  Julia is the marginally rebellious daughter, who thinks her mother fusses too much over her, wanting her mother to let her lead her own life.\nMuch of the interaction in this movie takes place between Dolly Parton, Olympia Dukakis, Shirley MacLaine, Darryl Hannah and Sally Field.  The women gossip, criticize each other and support each other, the kind of love and friendship that seems to exist more often in smaller communities.  Dolly Parton is outgoing and friendly, as is Olympia Dukakis.  Shirley MacLaine is noisy and complains about everything, figuring that being old and wealthy allows her the right to complain.  Darryl Hannah is a very religious frumpy young woman with (gasp!) a past, though her past seems mild to many of us.  These women support each other and provide advice, but also an outlet for their wishes and hopes and problems.  They also often like to talk about each other, though in a way they try hard to be polite and supportive when they can.\nSome of the funniest scenes involve Tom Skerritt as Sally Field's husband Drum.  Tom seems to have a way of doing things that provide at least smiles, and a bit of eye rolling on occasion.  Tom is funniest when he interacts with Shirley MacLaine.  Tom seems to enjoy tormenting Shirley and Shirley enjoys griping back at Tom.  While on one level it appears that the two dislike each other, the viewer also must recognize that they could have avoided each other and yet do not, so surely they must get some enjoyment out of the encounters.\nThe central character throughout the movie is Julia Roberts.  We discover early in the movie that she suffers from diabetes, and the effects are often severe.  The tension between Julia and Sally Field as Julia's symptoms and problems increase, and the tension with the rest of the women in the movie, increases during the movie, awaiting release.  The movie alternates between laughter and pain until near the ending that has its sad moments, but ends relatively happily as the true lesson of the movie is finally revealed.\nStories of real life are often boring or are hard to comprehend because of lack of a common background.  This story of real life has enough caricature to be funny enough to keep your attention, while being sufficiently rooted in life to allow you to feel like this life could have been yours, your parents, or your grandparents.\nSome of the subject matter in this film makes it unsuitable for young members of the family.  (...)  However, I think this excellent film should be suitable for older children and all other family members.","summary":"Happy, Sad, and a Celebration of Life","unixReviewTime":1081814400,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

Hart","reviewText":"In 1989, audiences were treated to an all-star cast in the film \"Steel Magnolias\", which follows the lives of several women who are all friends in a small Louisiana town.  The film was directed by Herbert Ross (1927-2001), who directed \"The Goodbye Girl\" (1977) and \"The Turning Point\" (1977, for which he received an Oscar nomination for Best Director).  It was written by Robert Harding, who had originally written \"Steel Magnolias\" as a play and also adapted Olivia Goldsmith's novel into the screenplay for \"The First Wives Club\" (1996).\nThe story begins with a young woman, Annelle Dupuy (Daryl Hannah), who is new to the Lousiana town and planning to work as a beautician for Truvy Jones (Dolly Parton), whose husband Spud Jones (Sam Shepard) is an often out-of-work contractor.  Impressed with her abilities, Truvy hires Annelle and they receive their first customers of the day: the wealthy widow Clairee Belcher (Olympia Dukakis), the responsible mother M'Lynn Eatenton (Sally Field), her engaged daughter Shelby (Julia Roberts) and the eccentric\/antisocial divorcee Ouiser Boudreaux (Shirley MacLaine).  Since one of the activities that most of the ladies enjoy doing is gossiping, when Ouiser begins to interrogate Annelle about her life, everyone is all ears as Annelle explains her troubled marriage and vanished husband.  Shelby then invites Annelle to come to her wedding, which Annelle does and meets a man who becomes very interested in her: Sammy Desoto (Kevin J. O'Connor).  Shelby's new husband is Jackson Latcherie (Dylan McDermott), and her outspoken father, Drum Eatenton (Tom Skerritt), often enjoys teasing Ouiser about her aging dog.  Shelby suffers from diabetes, but is determined to live as much of a normal life as possible, even when it comes into conflict with M'Lynn's concerns for her health.\nWith its witty script, wonderful story and engaging characters, \"Steel Magnolias\" is a very entertaining and emotional film.  Julia Roberts received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, but disappointingly, Sally Field was not nominated for Best Actress for her exceptional performance, especially during the very emotional funeral scene.  Olympia Dukakis, Shirley MacLaine and Daryl Hannah performed superbly in their roles, and Dolly Parton was very well casted for her role as Truvy and did an excellent job.  Memorable scenes in the film include the opening scenes at Truvy's beauty salon, Shelby's wedding, the Christmas fair, Shelby revealing her pregnancy, other scenes at Truvy's, Annelle's wedding shower, M'Lynn at the hospital, the funeral scene and the closing Easter scenes.  Overall, I rate \"Steel Magnolias\" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it on widescreen DVD.","summary":"\"Laughter through tears is my favorite emotion.\"","unixReviewTime":1076025600,"vote":17.0,"image":null}

But on the simple metric of number of one-liners per minute, I simply cannot think of a better comical powerhouse! The script to this movie is an example for screenwriters.\nThe hilarious star-studden ensemble is set in southern US, a small Louisiana town. The camaraderie is contagious and nostalgic, and the life of the characters so identifiable you'll be involved with the film immediately. There's almost several subthemes, each character has a peccadillo to share.\nBut the main focus of the film is the relationship between Sally Field and Julia Roberts, a domineering mother and her strong-willed but physically weak daughter respectively, the latter also plagued with diabetes. And there is a lot of time spent on Daryl Hannah's strange character development as well as the film covers a year or two via holidays.\nTo me, that is what most undermines the film -- I would much rather have seen more time spent on Parton and MacLaine, and even Dukakis, whose lives, in the brief glimpses we are given, seem much more interesting, and whose characters are by far much more alive and vibrant. Their barbs and quips are a compelling reason alone to watch this movie again and again!\nAt any rate, this is a movie you should definitely watch if you haven't already, and if you have, watch it again.

After seeing it again recently, I decided that calling it a \"chick flick\" demeans what director Herbert Ross and his cast and crew achieved. This film really does have wide and deep appeal to both and men and women of all ages. Of greater significance, it seems even better each time it is seen again. The reverse is true of almost all other films which touch our hearts.  As in Robert Harling's play on which it is based, all of the main characters are women: Clairee Belcher (Olympia Dukakis), M'Lynn Eatenton (Sally Field), Truvy Jones (Dolly Parton), Annelle Depuy Desoto (Daryl Hannah), Ouiser Boudreaux (Shirley MacLaine), and Shelby Eatenton Latcherie (Julia Roberts).\n\nMacLaine and Roberts were later nominated for an Academy Award as best actress in a supporting role; a split vote probably cost both an Oscar. My own opinion is that Field, Dukakis, and Hannah were equally deserving of that nomination. In terms of plot, not a great deal happens. The film's energy is established and then sustained by the interactions between and among the five older women. Keep in mind that this was originally a play whose plot focused almost entirely on the shared experiences of those women. Some of the scenes are hilarious, with MacLaine and Dukakis primarily responsible. However, the film also includes one extended situation which has a genuinely sad conclusion. (It would be a disservice to those who have not as yet seen the film to say any more about that.) I think the acting is first-rate throughout. Most of this film is highly entertaining but whenever necessary and appropriate, Ross examines serious issues with great skill. Two points need to be reiterated: Steel Magnolias can and will appeal to men as well as to women, and, it is more enjoyable each time it is seen again. Those who share my high regard for it are urged to check out Fried Green Tomatoes (1991).","summary":"Indomitable Charm","unixReviewTime":1060646400,"vote":102.0,"image":null}

Shelby (Julia Roberts)is a head-strong diabetic who, against doctor's orders, decides to get pregnant and have a child.  Based on a true story, \"Steel Magnolias\" concerns itself with the group of strong Southern women who become Shelby's insulated comfort zone during her time of need. Some of the aspects of the film, including dialogue references, costume design and overall set design, has pegged the movie as a product of the 80's.  That isn't to say that it's not a good film.  But it just doesn't hold up quite as well as say, \"Fried Green Tomatoes\".\nColumbia has given us a rather worn looking print of this movie.  Colors are slightly faded or off balance and there is some smearing of background details that comes from the overuse of noise reduction equipment in the DVD mastering process. No pixelization, some slight edge enhancement and a bit of fine detail shimmering also present.  The sound is amply presented but exhibits an equally dated characteristic.  The documentary that accompanies this feature is rather disappointing.

Yes the movie mirrors 1983's TERMS OF ENDEARMENT quite a bit, but this movie works with the star studded cast who all turn in worthy performances of Oscar's. It's such a special movie about love and friendship between these women, and the ties that bind them together. Roberts' character suffers from diabetes and has a child against her doctors orders. Her character needs a kidney transplant and her on screen mom played by Sally Field, gives her kidney. However the kidney is rejected and ultimately Roberts' character dies. Truly tugs at the heartstrings and Field gives a demanding performance with her outburst at the end after the funeral. Parton, Hannah, MacLaine and Dukakis turn in comical performances that make you smile and warms your heart. Overall truly a beautiful movie that I do consider a classic.","summary":"Classic Movie","unixReviewTime":1046649600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Taylor","reviewText":"An extremely episodic story of several smalltown southern women whose social lives revolve around meetings in the local beauty parlor, STEEL MAGNOLIAS' script and performances are dogged by an aura of artificiality--but it scarcely matters, for the film is a tremendous amount of fun.\nSome of the performances are more successful than others, with Shirley MacLaine, Olympia Dukakis, Julia Roberts, and Darryl Hannah coming out on top (I am greatly surprised that so many other reviewers dislike Hannah's performance, which seems to me considerably less artificial than many others--but perhaps since I'm actually Southern I have a different perspective); Sally Fields and Dolly Parton are less successful, but not in any sense that actually distracts from the fun.  Perhaps most surprising in a film which focuses on women are the brief but impressive performances from the male supporting cast, which includes effective performances by Tom Skerrit, Sam Shepherd, and Dylan McDermott, and which serve to ground the film with a sense of the broader community in which the women live.\nThe script abounds in zinging one-liners (\"If you can't say something nice, come sit by me!\") and often hilarious situations (imagine Olympia Dukakis surrounded by naked men in the highschool football team's locker room); it also contains some very touching segments sure to choke up all but the most heartless viewer. And although the story is extremely manipulative and rather predictable, those factors don't actually get in the way of its effectiveness.  While probably not a \"great film\" by any serious standard, it is tremendously good-natured, well-intended, and extremely entertaining, and most people will find that it lingers pleasantly in mind and holds up well under repeated viewings.","summary":"Flawed But Extremely Appealing & Entertaining","unixReviewTime":1009670400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Have we seen it before?. Yes. \"Terms Of Endearment\", a better movie, comes immediatley to mind. This movie works because of the cast : Sally Field, Julia Roberts, Daryl Hannah, Shirley MacLaine, Dolly Parton, Olympia Dukakis, Tom Skerritt, and Dylan McDermott. These people give some of the best performances of their careers. The plot centers around a group of southern women who share each other's business while going to a local beauty shop. Another storyline includes Sally Fields' daughter(Roberts)getting married. If you haven't seen this movie, then that's all I'll say. Field gives a great performance. Her outburst scene towards the end is a real stand out. However, MacLaine steals every frame she's in as a sharp tongued southerner. Julia Roberts shines here too.

But as a matter of honest opinion, to place it in such a small subject field is an insult to the film. As Fried Green Tomatoes did in the latter years, Steel Magnolias show's how strong relationships can be. To know how important it is to remain steadfast with your friend's, so they are there when you need them. Through humor, this film version of the play displays the caring qualities between a lovable bunch of nag's. With the griping and gossip that they spring, you hear their form of hilarious communication. Based on a true heartbreaking story, the screenwriter has done a terrific job choreographing the language between the six ladies to show the up's and down's of life, and being a diabetic. (\"Shelby's\" character, portrayed by Julia Robert's, is in fact the screenwriter's sister. My heart goes out to him.) The DVD is everything it should be, and makes it even more enjoyable than the old scratchy copy I had. I don't like admitting everything to the whole world, but if a story comes along that is very uplifting and yet sad, I can usually hold back the water works. When I watched this film the first time, and the end came, I wept. So, feller's watch out.","summary":"Shelby","unixReviewTime":999302400,"vote":null,"image":null}

There you go, Steel Magnolias.  This film about six women whose lives are bound together both by kindred spirits, and by the joys and sorrows of their lives, could have ended up sappy and maudlin. Instead, saved by wit, a fine edge of meanness, and a goofy charm, this film really works.  It makes the friendships feel real, the characters seem knowable and familiar.  These aren't perfect women with perfect lives who smile through tragedy.  These are women you know, or would like to know.  There's not a bad performance in the whole film, and the supporting cast is as good as the leads are.  They'll have you weeping helplessly one minute and screaming with laughter the next.\nOne caveat: One of the selling points for the DVD is the promise of 9 extra scenes.  Frankly, there is a good reason why these never made it into the film.  They're unmemorable; they don't advance the plot, or contribute much to characterization.  If this is the make-or-break point for buying the DVD, I wouldn't bother.  That said, I love the quality, and the other special features are pretty interesting.

The dynamic chemistry between Olympia Dukakis and Shirley MacLaine's characters were perfect. I couldn't imagine any other actor in their places. Those two seasoned actresses were made for those roles. I loved the banter between them. As cranky as Shirley MacLaine's character was, deep down inside she really wasn't as mean as one might think.

My heart broke into two when Sally finally couldn't contain her grief anymore. I loved Dolly Parton in this film just as much as I enjoyed Julia Roberts and Daryl Hannah. I really thought this was one of Julia's better films along with Daryl Hannah's too.

It is reasonable that, as portrayed, the government would do everything in its power to deny the arrival of extra-terrestrials, not because I believe they exist, but because governments are historically fearful of a knowledgeable public.\n\nEven on the VHS tape of this movie, there is an interview following the movie.  Just why would there not have been air conditioning brought in to the hangar in Alabama, so that the crew and actors were not sweltering.  What was the point?  I mean, they went to India.  This is why I can't even be an extra.  I'm working.  I get fed.  I don't get exposed to conditions that could land me in the hospital.  This is all very sado-masochistic.

I got this digitally from Amazon in 2008 when streaming video was still a novel and new thing. I didn't care that it was standard def. It's about the story and characters. From a close encounter to a pile of mashed potato or (gasp) a mother in search of her missing child taken by aliens many are drawn to Devils Tower National Monument for their even closer encounter.\n\nI don't want to say too much about the plot because it so much fun to watch it unfold. The story holds up great over the decades. It has lots of intentional humor and some little funny things like the license plate on the car changing when it gets to a new state... It may seem a little strange that there are no cell phones - but back then they didn't exist! It's a Spielberg classic and in its own way as timeless as the original Star Wars.\n\nThe quality of the video i got in 2008 is only SD. It's available in HD now and looks a lot better. BUT remember this is from the 70's and technology in film, audio and special effects were nothing like today. It should be watched with allowances for when it was made.\n\nI think it's a great story.and well worth watching for the first time today with allowances for the state of the art in movie making at the time is was made. Give it a watch. It's could open your imagination. it did mine.

There are parallel stories of other people encountering UFO's. Eventually the government is also contacted by the UFOs and sets up a meeting with them had a unique location. The individuals encountered have also been compelled to attend; this to the government's consternation. Will the other invitees make it to the rendezvous point? What trials and tribulations must they endure on the way?\n\n The lighter version, \"The Collector's Edition\" (ASIN: 0767827031) of the film. This is closer to the original cut but still not the one shown on TV. I bought this version after I realized I had the darker version. Amazon.com did the research for me\n\nThe dark version, also called \"The Collector's Edition\" However I think it was supposed to be a director's cut (ASIN: 0800198395) cut out all the comic scenes like the throwing all the dirt in the window prior to building the replica of Devils Mountain. And added some \"Mother gets disturbed scenes.\" I bought the dark version first because I thought it had the special ending where the inside of the ship is shown. But I did not know that it was completely remade. Some of the Gas mask scenes are missing also.\n\nIf this review ends up on another version you will have to check for your self how complete it really is and what has been cut out.\n\nOther than that if you did not see the original or the third version that is shown periodically on TV you would like this movie and it is worth the purchase price.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWell now I do not want to mix media with a review that is for the movie however a later contribution with the advent of Blu-ray is the two DVD \"30th Anniversary Ultimate\" editions which seems to have picked up some original material missing from all the tapes. Again I am not trying to distract from the movie content but this edition show that (probably due to this being a movie from the pre-blu-ray era) some scenes are clear and almost three dimensional while others are very grainy and of poor focus.

I never owned it on DVD or Bluray until a few days ago. I was at my local used DVD\/Bookstore and began browsing the hundreds of DVD titles for cheap. Less than $10 section. To my amazement, there it was, the 30th Anniversary Ultimate Edition, complete, for a whopping $7.00. I could not pass this up. It is in near mint condition! I am very happy to own this title now. With this set, I went out and got the \"Essentials\" Blu-ray Edition that has only the 3 movies on Blu-ray (says Disc 1) on bottom.\nNow, I have the Ultimate set and I didn't have to pay the \"Ultimate Price\" either!\nI love the movie, but the aliens used in the picture are just not that believable. Since there was no CGI back in the day, it was okay.\nNow, seeing the likes of THE ABYSS, T2, Jurassic Park movie technology and what can be accomplished with creatures, I think the movie can use a \"touch up\" with the creature effects only. The ships are wonderful.\n\n*** The Special Features for the set here are spread out on the 3 separate DVDs and each \"Version\" of the movie gets it's own DVD. Decent for this format. The \"Making Of\" Documentary is part 1 on DISC ONE, part 2 on DISC TWO, part 3 on DISC THREE with a few more special features on the 3rd DISC to round out the remainder of them.\nThe packaging is pretty nice and colorful with a nice foldout poster and great colorful picture book inside as well. I have taken a picture of my set to add to this review. Enjoy this movie for what it is, pure Sci-Fi fantasy greatness! The sound is awesome on the set as well and even more enhanced for the Blu-ray editions.","summary":"~ A Beautiful 30th Anniversary Edition Box Set with Colorful foldout poster and nicely done book on the movie ~","unixReviewTime":1484006400,"vote":3.0,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81qw+CFXFAL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71jRkRXtaUL._SY88.jpg"]}

Anderson","reviewText":"Watched this after watching Contact for the first time, and there is no contest about which one is better. The positive reviews for this movie mention \"a sense of wonder an awe\" a lot, Ebert included, and I just don't see it. The main character is an awful person that I didn't want to root for BEFORE he starting losing his mind, let alone after. The pacing is dreadful and the motivations of the characters and the government is poorly sketched, so it's just hard to care about what's happening on screen. Possibly worse, they kept trying to add suspense with mysteries and spooky happenings that the movie had already let the audience in on 10 minutes ago.\n\nThe only redeeming factor was some good thematic moviemaking. People struggling to communicate and have relationships with each other, giving a dim view of the almost impossible communication with another species. It's a shame those themes don't get resolved in the script and that the main character doesn't appear to change himself or the plot by the finale.\n\nSkip it.","summary":"Skip it, watch Contact","unixReviewTime":1481155200,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

Plenty of extras make this a DVD set that people will return to over and over again for entertainment.\n\nThe movie's quite simple: after a very strange encounter with bright flying lights one evening, everyman Roy Neary starts experiencing compulsions and visions related to a particular mountain and a particular strain of music. Apparently people all over the world are also having similar encounters and subsequent visions. The visions draw Roy and his compatriots to a Wyoming mountain, where all signs point to an impending world-shaking encounter with aliens. Meanwhile, the American government is also aware of the impending meeting; its agents are doing everything they can to secure the area. Roy must evade these agents to reach the mountain so he can respond to the celestial invitation he's been given. It's a slow burn of a movie, more about how someone normal responds to an extraordinary situation than about the actual mechanics of aliens and spaceships. It doesn't whizbang with car chases and shootouts, but that's a big part of its charm (when a group of government scientists break into an office in one scene to steal a large globe, I cheer every time that thing thumps into the hallway as they roll it away--it's such a human moment; yes, they don't really need the globe, but it's so exciting to see anyway). And when someone considers the year in which this movie was made, its special effects become all the more impressive. I find these older movies very charming because their special effects had to be made by hand.\n\nThe box set includes not only the different versions of the movie from the theatrical release to the 1980 Special Edition and also a more recent Collector's Edition that includes a bunch of once-deleted scenes and what I think is a much smoother ending. We also get a bunch of interviews, documentaries, and associated standard DVD extras like deleted scenes. The sound and visual quality is superb and quite beautifully mastered, with even dark scenes crisp and easy to see. The creators of this edition really worked hard to take full advantage of modern technology. Even if someone has one of the previous Close Encounters DVD, this might be a really good upgrade to consider for its extras and incredible mastering. And if one has not ever seen this classic, what better time to jump in?","summary":"Excellent release of a classic science-fiction movie.","unixReviewTime":1443312000,"vote":null,"image":null}

In 1977 these special effects with all the electronics activating themselves and the giant spaceship coming down must of been earth shattering but viewed now it is a slow, disjointed mess. I know the guy playing the Frenchman is a legendary director but having the character be French means nothing, and is especially confusing to follow. Why is a French UFO hunter investigating missing American WWII planes? What?!? It goes on from the as we transition from one drawn out scene to the next. The characters are all flat, Dreyfuss is underwhelming and after his encounter, he has visions which cause his wife and family to split. I never cared about any of the characters, they were one dimensional and stereotypical. It just goes on too long. This is a slow plodding film with no rhyme or reason that just doesn't hold up. Save yourself 2 and 1\/2 hours and skip this. After Jaws, Spielberg was the it boy and they gave him carte blanche and he gave them an alien encounter movie.

Disc 1 has all 3 versions, and Disc 2 has all the same extras as the 30th Anniv version.\n\nRoy Neary's going into the ship in the '80 version was a studio decision that Spielberg was dead-set against, but his clout in Hollywood wasn't as strong back then. The studio executives thought it's what the audience wanted. His \"Director's Cut\" is the REAL Spielberg version. I must agree; the extra effects in the '80 version diminished the awe of Neary's adventure, a sort of anti-climax.\n\nIt's truly an awesome film achievement, nominated for 8 Oscars, but not Best Picture. I have no end of admiration for Spielberg's film, in any of its incarnations. Dreyfuss won the Best Actor Oscar, deservedly, for \"The Goodbye Girl\" in '77, but I'm sure the strength of his performance in \"Close Encounters\" was considered.  A class act, and a courageous performance, in both cases.\n\nI love this film, on so many levels.

A long lost, stranded ship was suddenly found, in of all places... the middle of the desert. But, where are the U.S. Fighter Pilots and the ships', crew members? A shrouded mystery or a forth coming revelation? And why, only now..., are people from all over the globe starting to witness bright lights and unidentified flying objects also known as U.F.O.'s, soaring across the peaceful, night skies? And why, are the witnesses of this cosmic phenomenon being sun-burned from the rays of light that the U.F.O.'s emit? In addition too, having a sudden compulsion that ever-increasingly becomes an obsession to visit the \"Devil's Tower\" located in the State of Wyoming? And again why are they all playing or humming the same musical notes, that is innately foreign to them? Just what exactly is happening to them? And more importantly, what did the sighting of these U.F.O.'s do to them, so that their previously \"normal\" behavior is now erratic, compulsive and even  obsessive? What is the secret of Devil's Tower in conjunction with the U.F.O. witnesses that are driven to get there, come what may? While thousands of others, who live around the Devil's Tower\/Wyoming area, are being systematically evacuated from the surrounding region by the United States Government, no less? What's happening? Could it be that the American Government and officials from foreign countries are conducting celestial experiments and communicating with martians and other space aliens? If so, why wasn't the public told? And if the U.S. and combined allied governments are not exploring space communications, are we being invaded, unknowingly? And why are the witnesses of these U.F.O. sightings... world over, being patronized and talked too... as if they all, at the same time, have suddenly gone crazy? What is going on?! And what is a CLOSE ENCOUNTER OF THE THIRD KIND, anyway? Within this enormously popular, 1977, color, extraterrestrial, Box Office-smash hit, film: CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND - the 30th, 2-disc, DVD set, Anniversary Edition which was remastered in High Definition with Dolby 5.1 Sound, mesmerizes and visually stuns the viewing audience with brilliant special effects, story and content. This amazing, science-fiction blockbuster which was directed by the Academy Award-winning Director - Steven Spielberg, dramatically astounds and comically amuses it's audience with it's ultra-creative, big-screen, special effects and overall wonderful story and superb contents. This Columbia Pictures\/EMI presentation of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND - 30TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION is nothing short of spectacular! This controversial yet fascinating topic about U.F.O.'s and the people that witness their sighting, is as intriguing as it is, engaging. Are we alone? According to this awesome movie extravaganza, apparently not. This incredibly popular motion picture was so well done, that it was nominated for 8 Academy Awards and rightly, so! Because this is not just another excellent film, it is truly, a motion picture event! Steven Spielberg clearly shows his creative genius as both, a Screenplay Writer and Director of this riveting film. So, that brings us to the obvious question: What exactly is a CLOSE ENCOUNTER OF THE THIRD KIND? Good question. The FIRST ENCOUNTER - is the witnessing of an actual unidentified flying object (U.F.O.), flying through the sky. The SECOND ENCOUNTER - is the discovery of physical evidence which validates that there was an actual appearance of an unidentified flying object (U.F.O.). And the THIRD ENCOUNTER - is the actual contact with the U.F.O. and\/or it's alien inhabitants. And this film also brilliantly illustrates as well as educates, the viewing public - with dramatic flair and pockets of cosmic relief, about all three forms of U.F.O. encounters. And because this awesome motion picture deals with a very unique topic and the subsequent emotions and personal drama that is associated with but kept under wraps when experiencing and dealing with U.F.O. sightings. Or what one 'thinks' is an unidentified flying object and the rejection and disbelief that one faces from the scoffers and the nay-sayer's, resounds world over with the viewing audience. Why? Because people usually think that a person who says that they have seen a U.F.O., have just had a bad session with their psychiatrist and are hallucinating or that their medication needs to be adjusted. Others, are thought to have 'popped one too many' illegal pills and are \"tripping!\" Or that they have '...fallen of of the wagon...' and are back on the bottle. Either that, or they have smoked and inhaled a little to much of their marijuana or hashish - joint\/reefer cigarette, and are now... flying high, together with their imaginary, little green men and Martian brethren. Or lastly, that they are just plain losing their mind. Sounds reasonable, right?! Because after all, there is no such thing as a U.F.O., right?! Not according to Roy Neary - played by Actor Richard Dreyfuss, who had a 'sighting' and then some, while driving to work in his cable truck, one night. A happily married, husband and father who up to that point, had no mental or emotional \"instabilities\" and was thought to be \"normal\", had absolutely nothing better to do other than ruin his marriage and relationship with his children by coming home in the middle of the night, claiming that he saw an unidentified flying object. It completely changed his life and led him and all others that saw the U.F.O.'s, on a celestial quest of discovery which culminated at a mountain-like structure, named: Devil's Tower. This superb film which brilliantly depicts an epic odyssey of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, is a colossal, big-screen, achievement. Produced by Julia Phillips and Michael Phillips with music by John Williams, it stars: Actors Richard Dreyfuss as Roy Neary; Actress Teri Garr as his wife  Ronnie Neary; Francois Truffant as Claude Lacombe and Melinda Dillon as Julian Guiler. It comes in spoken English with subtitles in English, Spanish and French. And, as if that weren't enough, this electrifying motion picture comes with a Steven Spielberg cast and crew, interview; deleted scenes; theatrical trailers and the making of a documentary and behind the behind the scenes footage of this incredible, one-of-a-kind, epic production. This is one entertaining movie which will take you out of your comfort zone with it's dazzling creativity and wondrous amazement, in search of the cosmic unknown. So, get your popcorn ready, get good and comfy and ENJOY! Because in every sense, this is an awesome film and a true sight and thrill to behold!

So many of these movies are said to be meant as a metaphor (I suppose if one has a cause one wants to champion). What about Close Encounters of the Third Kind? What is the hidden meaning or relevancy, if there is one?\n\nMy cause, I suppose, is men's rights. I'm sympathetic towards the men's movement. When I watched, really listened (playing in the next room) the film Rain Man, I couldn't help wonder if the film makers were intentionally contrasting the two main characters in the film, Tom Cruise, a harried self-employed man, and Dustin Hoffman his brother who is stricken by Autism. Dozens of years ago (now long forgotten from memory) psychologists felt Autism was caused by some kind of environmental problem or parental neglect. But the existence of such an idea could potentially be offensive toward women and mothers somehow? In the film Rain Man itself, the film may be suggesting the child with Autism is the luckier or happier of the two.\n\nWatching Spielberg's film Jaws (which I may soon review), the police chief makes it, the college guy makes it, but the working class guy just can't escape the shark. There's a scene, when their ship first sets out on the water, I believe, where you can see a reflection of the American flag showing on the water.\n\nWhen watching the paranoid SF film 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', and it's sequel, the films are warning us, ironically, of mind control emanating from Hollywood? Planet of the Apes is warning us not just of mental degradation, a society where the humans don't speak, but also a kind of racial replacement? Enough is enough already with these old films?\n\nThinking about Closer Encounters (after only first watching the whole movie on TV 5 or so years ago), I had to wonder, myself, if this film was focusing on Richard Dreyfuss's mental illness. I remembered the scene of him throwing shrubs out the window. Are masses of American men in such dire straights? What about real people, apparently, who honestly believe they have been visited by UFO's? Is this film exploring mental illness, or is it meant to bring to life the thoughts of someone who genuinely believes they've been visited by aliens? Could there be a more noble cause than giving voice to such a voiceless and likely powerless person?\n\nThe film Close Encounters of the Third Kind for the most part takes it's subject literally and doesn't seem to be a metaphor for something else. It's a good film that makes you think about the possibility of extraterrestrial life. There's a great line in the movie where Richard Dreyfuss, while speaking to a government official, tells the official, \"You can't fool us, by agreeing with us\". Close Encounters shows government officials dealing with the public in a secretive and less than open and upfront way. Shouldn't government just be more open and honest, and about the people? Of the people, and not the elites?\n\n(in case you missed it, I'm suggesting this film helped get Ronald Reagan elected president, or at least smooth that transition or process).\n\nWhen watching Close Encounters again, I knew what to expect. There were the 'astronauts', young people from all over the globe, dressed in their suits and apparently, waiting to board the alien ships. And the small aliens leave their ship, seemingly to be exchanged with them and ready to spend some time on Earth. I'd read stories of explorers and natives making exchanges like this, for the purpose of language acquisition, this scene reminded me of these stories. When the alien ship leaves, however, at the end of the film, no one but Richard Dreyfuss gets on the ship? Is it just me, or at the end, does the film show Richard Dreyfuss and no one else, getting on the alien ship before it leaves? The aliens sure went to a lot of trouble to pick up one guy from Indiana. I watched the ending again (although I haven't see all three versions), and it's true, no one but Richard Dreyfuss gets on the alien ship.","summary":"Some poor schmo's day dream of leaving this Earth.","unixReviewTime":1402617600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Instead, I will address the minor controversy surrounding the Blu-Ray editions of the movie.\n\nAs everyone knows, there are two types of Blu-Ray editions of \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\". One is the 30th anniversary box set, which includes the three versions of the movie (Theatrical, Special Edition and Director's Cut) on one disc; a plethora of bonus features on the second; and a booklet (the 3-disc DVD version of the set contains one version on one disc each, a making-of documentary scattered on all the discs, and the rest of the bonus features on the director's cut disc). The other is the cheaper, newly released \"Blu-Ray Essentials\" version, which only contains the first disc of all the three versions but no booklet and zero bonus features (except for the Blu-Ray exclusive \"A View from Above\" feature, whose main purpose is to show viewers the difference between all three versions).\n\nThe reason I'm addressing this is because some Amazon.com reviewers (including myself) have expressed dismay over buying the wrong edition. Unlike these reviewers, I am not entirely angered by this since I already have the 30th anniversary edition on DVD and that I bought the \"Essentials\" version just to upgrade to Blu-Ray (it also helped that it was on sale for a meager $7). But I can understand the frustrations looming in the reviews section and I wish Amazon would have notified this and state the differences.\n\nIf you're going to upgrade to Blu-Ray and want to learn the history behind \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\", it's highly recommended you buy the 30th Anniversary box set. However, if you just want to buy \"Close Encounters\" primarily for the picture and audio quality and have no care for the extras, the \"Blu-Ray Essentials\" version will serve you well. It also helps that it's much cheaper than the other set (at least, at this moment).\n\nEither way, this movie is a dazzler on Blu-Ray. Columbia did a phenomenal job restoring \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" in its best condition. The picture quality is superb and the audio is dazzling, particularly on the surround sound speakers. Some reviewers complained about the existence of grain, but this movie was shot on celluloid, not digital photography, so, of course, the grain is inevitable. Even so, it shouldn't distract from the incredible experience you'll have while watching this terrific movie on Blu-Ray and with a big screen TV. When the alien mothership lands on the Devil's Tower in the movie's climax, you'll feel the experience like no other in the previous VHS and DVD versions.\n\n\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" belongs in every movie collection and now thanks to Blu-Ray, it looks and sounds better than ever. If you are hesitant to replace your DVD player with a Blu-Ray player, then this version of this film should force your hand.\n\nStrongest recommendation.","summary":"A few things to clear up about the \"Close Encounters\" Blu-Ray","unixReviewTime":1396569600,"vote":56.0,"image":null}

Alas, it didn't turn out to be the attraction for the ages that so many people, myself included, had hoped. That said, it does deliver a terrific amount of entertainment value.\n\nThe title refers to a phrase invented by science author J. Allan Hynek (who shows up in a cameo role) to describe three potential interactions between humans and alien life forms. The first involves a sighting, the second produces physical evidence, and the third results in some sort of contact.\n\nIn this story, Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), an Indiana electric utility company worker and family man, experiences a close encounter of the first kind one night while investigating a power outage. He sees something extraordinary that scares the wits out of him and also leaves him with an encounter of the second kind (a partial sunburn) and disturbs him so severely that it eventually estranges his wife Ronnie (Teri Garr) and his children. But the episode also endears him to Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon), a similarly tormented, single mother whose son (played amazingly well by four-year-old Cary Guffey) has been kidnapped, presumably by the aliens. While Neary tries desperately to figure out what is going on, in another part of the country a secret team led by French scientist Claude Lacombe (the great movie director Francois Truffaut) is investigating the recent strange occurrences, and the efforts eventually draw everyone involved to a climactic meeting at a most distinctive geographic landmark. Spielberg orchestrated that climax with so much visceral power that I once saw a fellow moviegoer weeping uncontrollably after the house lights came back up.\n\nThe movie's emotional punch even caused Stanley Kaufman, the august movie critic of The New Republic, to call Close Encounters not so much a movie as \"an event in the history of faith.\" In more proper perspective, Gary Arnold concluded his review in The Washington Post by saying that if real aliens ever landed and they didn't resemble Spielberg's vision, \"they obviously aren't movie lovers, have no romance in their souls, and to hell with `em.\" However you end up reacting, you'll probably agree that Close Encounters demonstrated how Spielberg was destined to become a giant of American cinema.\n\nIn an interview with Film Comment magazine, Spielberg once summed up his abilities by saying, \"I sort of know what works.\" It's true. What's also true is Close Encounters works despite making very little sense - if start asking obvious questions the whole story begins to fall apart. No matter. Spielberg communicates subliminally to moviegoers so effectively that they willingly buy on, whatever the logical shortcomings. Along with the director's considerable skills at cinematic storytelling, the movie boasts dazzling and groundbreaking visual effects by Douglas Trumbull; gorgeous, Oscar-winning cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond, and possibly the best work that composer John Williams has ever done. It's an absolute crowd-pleaser.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition\/dp\/B00HU8VK4K\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)<\/a>","summary":"An absolute crowd-pleaser","unixReviewTime":1382313600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Others have so fully summarized the movie and provided their opinions upon the acting performances, et al, I will refrain from doing so and just focus upon the quality of the  transfer from Standard Definition to Blu Ray which is what I do with all my reviews.\n\nWith this disc you get 3 different versions of the film, you get the theatrical release, a special version and the Directors cut.  I chose the Director's Cut as if it is what Spielberg envisioned and not the studios, then that I what I want to see. The theatrical version clocks in at 135 minutes, while the Special Edition clocks in at 132 minutes and the Director's Cut at 137minutes.  The Audio for all 3 versions is DTS MA 5.1 lossless audio for English and French, while the Spanish viewer gets lossless Dolby True HD 5.1.  Since both lossless codecs are very good and significantly better than any lossy audio codec, I do not believe that anyone could tell the difference, but more on the audio later on.\n\nVIIDEO....The cover of the Blu Ray says that the film has been remastered and I believe it.  While I had not seen the film in many years and do not own the Standard Def DVD and, thus, have nothing to compare it with, all I can say is that the video transfer looks beautiful in all ways.  The colors are just gorgeous with the daylight sky shots a rich and smooth blue.  The blacks are as true to black as I have seen in the past with great details easily showing in these dark and shadowy areas.  At no point in watching the Director's Cut did I see any artifacting nor stair-stepping which would have been prominent is many of the wide angle landscape shots.  The video transfer absolutely deserves the 5 stars I gave it.\n\nAUDIO...Watched in the lossless DTS MA HD 5.1 and the balance of audio levels between the dialogue and John Williams music score was exceptionally good.  The music score is spread quite nicely across the front stage with stereo imaging of the instruments nicely placed.  During the first  half of the movie I was a touch disappointed that the rear channels were not used that often for front to rear pans or foley FX.  However, the second half of the film wakes things up with several uses for the rear channels and discreet channeling of the audio fx to both left and right.  It is here where your LFE sub channel will come alive and if you have a good sub and it is set properly, it will certainly get a musical workout.  I rate the overall  audio with 4 stars.\n\nEXTRAS...While I have read that there were several extras on other releases of this film,  this particular release had no 'making of' documentaries or commentaries.  The only extra, which I did not use or try, is a special pop up called 'In Movie A View from Above (Editor's Fact Ttrack'.  This feature pops up an icon, depending upon which version of the film you are watching that provides a fact or two about why a specific scene was cut or added back in as well as other trivia I suppose.  At least there were no previews for other movies taking up room on the Blu Ray.  I hate to pay for advertising and an even greater compression of the feature film than it needs to be.\n\nAll in all, this is a classic film with brilliant work by Richard Dreyfus, a superior actor, and a great transfer on Blu Ray.  I would encourage you to purchase it.\nI do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase or not.\nThank you for reading.","summary":"Close Encounters of the Third Kind in 3 flavors on Blu Ray","unixReviewTime":1372550400,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

I just wanted to say something negative about Richard Dreyfus, who in my opinion is possibly one of the worst actors - ever.  And I mean that.  He's untalented, irritating and just terrible in every role.  I can't think of one role he's done where that whiny, abrasive, neurotic personality doesn't diminish the movie.  And I can't think of any movie he's been in that virtually ANY other actor could not have done better.  That includes Close Encounters, the Goodbye Girl, What About Bob, etc.  Honestly, I try to avoid his films at all costs - but a couple of these had good stories and other good actors.  This movie is one of those.  So I was compelled to watch it.  But it makes you wish at several points in the movie that they would have just killed off his character and gone in a different direction.  It was a mistake to try and build a great movie around him, and obviously, I'm still unhappy that they tried.  I don't know who's life he saved, or who he loaned money to - but somebody clearly was forced to put him in.  He, by himself, brought this movie down two full stars.  Still a good one, but it could have been really superb without him.  Well, there it is.  Richard, I hope you run across this review someday and understand how much I really despise the fact that you \"made it\" to the big screen when so many other deserving, talented actors did not.  You sir are living proof that there is no justice in this world.  Enjoy my review!","summary":"A film even Richard Dreyfus couldn't ruin.","unixReviewTime":1370131200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Kuhlman","reviewText":"are on blu-ray, in the 2-disc set, all are excellent, for different reasons, and all are part of cinematic history.\n\nI like Spielberg's third Director's Cut the best, except that it excludes Roy at the power station in the beginning which was shown in the 1977 original theatrical release version.  This scene was important, to show why Roy chooses not to show up for that job anymore after his initial UFO sighting (the job was thankless and his bosses were real A-holes).\n\nFlip-flopped in the Special Edition and Director's Cut are the night sighting picnic with the India \"Where did these sounds come from?\" segments, which, I think, flow better in the order they were presented in the 1977 version.  The cut between the night sighting picnic that turns out to be noisy helicopters and the subsequent dead-quiet of the observation station is more jarring in the latter two versions than in the 1977 version, where the noisy helicopter's search light on Roy cuts to the cars arriving in India in sunlight.  But, in the grand scheme, of the timeline of chronologically telling the story, one can see why Spielberg flip-flopped the order of these two scenes.\n\nThe \"pillow mountain bit\" is happily removed from the latter two versions; never much cared for that.\n\nCarl Weathers (Apollo Creed of Rocky fame) does a brief cameo in the 1977 version as an Army seargant who interrogates suspicious-looking Roy, who looks like a potential looter, during the evacuation sequence, when the bird salesman is doing a great scare job in the background.  This bit, quirky but not really necessary, is happily removed from the latter two versions, and instead the scene hangs on the bird salesman saying \"Even my dog has a gas mask!  And any of you folks are worth more than a dog!\"  Funny.\n\nThe Roy in the bathtub fully-clothed sequence, which ends in a horrible screaming match that involves the whole Neary family, followed by the Roy yanking out the neighbor's chicken wire and throwing bricks and dirt into his kitchen window to build his ultimate Devil's Tower model next day, perfectly segues into Roy's wife, Ronnie, taking the kids and leaving for her sister's, for good, in the Director's Cut.  In the 1977 cut, we don't know what the heck Ronnie is talking about when she says to Roy, in the morning, \"I'm sorry about last night\", and, in the 1980 Special Edition cut, the entire Roy throwing dirt into the house scene is excised, cutting from Roy realizing that Devil's Tower has a cut-off peak, to Ronnie taking the kids, which also doesn't make sense.  I'm glad Spielberg finally got it right by including BOTH scenes in his Director's Cut.\n\nThis is one of the most AWESOME achievements in cinematic history, a triumph of human imagination, and a film that has a truly noble, altruistic agenda, in an era of otherwise formulaic \"beastie\" monster movies.  It gets the awesome transfer, in all 3 versions, that it deserves.  Spielberg's critics said \"lightning can't strike twice\" after the wunderkind young director struck a massive bolt with his last stroke of genius, Jaws.  They were wrong!\n\nThis set has excellent behind-the-scenes extras, including the classic 1977 Watch the Skies featurette that was shown in cinemas (finally transferred here in HD!), a complete 1997 retrospective produced by Laurent Bouzereau, and some new interviews with Spielberg, also produced and directed by Bouzerau, that shed new \"light\" on the whole project.

Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a classic American film. It was directed by Stephan Spielberg and stars Richard Dreyfus.  This film set the tone for much of what happened at the movies for roughly the next 15-20 years following its 1977 theatrical release. Close Encounters is essentially a near perfect product defining the time it came out.  The film explores alien visitors, government conspiracies, general paranoia, sensationalism. family issues, and ultimately madness.  The depth these issues are explored make this film a hallmark of American cinema. It is the movie version of imagination and wonder. This is a philosophy and vision regarding what an alien visit to the planet would look like.  There is no war and nothing is getting blown up. The main thing happening is communication. It is amazing. It is done in a such a thoughtful way that it stands effectively as an excellent contribution to the collective consciousness imagination about such matters as alien visits. After repeat viewings the most important question is: What do you believe? This is a human film that defines the medium of movie making.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this is a flying saucer.","summary":"The Empire 5 Star 500 - #106","unixReviewTime":1340064000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Mikels","reviewText":"When it first made its theatrical run, I thought Spielberg's offering of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS was campy weak sauce.  (After all, I was into the 'Star Wars' craze of the time.)  I mean, come on:  Richard Dreyfuss sculpting on a heap of mashed potatoes in a (futile) attempt to recreate the image of Devil's Tower; earthlings communicating with a highly advanced civilization via. . .muscial notes.  My eye muscles were sore due to the constant rolling of them.  I was (and is) a huge fan of Spielberg's 'Jaws'; with this sci-fi pseudo epic, I had thought the young director badly missed the mark.  There weren't even any Jedi lightsabers, for cryin' out loud.\n\nNow that I'm older (and hopefully wiser) I've come to respect and admire nuance and substance.  Having recently caught this 1977 feature film again (thank you, cable), I was, simply, impressed.  Very impressed.  This story of a sudden onslaught of UFO sightings, and subsequent 'close encounters' of a select few (who then became obsessed wanting to know the answers to unknown questions) is as compelling and believable as it is fascinating and thought-provoking.  Now it makes sense to me how Dreyfuss's character indirectly goes off his rocker and embarks on some really bizarre behaviour.  (The scene depicting him yanking his shrubs out of the ground and hurling them through the windows of his home while his terrified family look on had me in stitches.)  An alien encounter at a rural home where a horrified young mother (Melinda Dillon) watches appliances from her vacuum to her dishwasher come on by themselves--screws from a floor vent magically unscrewing themselves out of the floor--is jarring and indeed frightening.  Spielberg's story then rushes breathlessly to Devil's Tower, Wyoming, where (under the guise of a chemical contamination to empty the local population) swarthy G-men prepare for a very special visitor--and a select few of those who are touched by alien contact enter onstage, too.\n\nAnd the table is set for the climax; even now, all these years later, I marvel at the special effects.  The image of spacecraft of varying shapes, sizes, and colors is awe-inspiring.  (The munchin-like appearances of the extraterrestrials is kind of lame, but who nitpicks?)  Over the course of this encounter, those who have disappeared over the years come home, and a select few volunteers board the mother ship.  And we witness an exchange of civilizations sans violence and bloodshed--in essence, an exchange that someday may very well happen.  Augmented and enhanced by the core group of Dreyfuss, Dillon, Teri Garr, Bob Balaban, and Francois Truffaut, Steven Spielberg's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND is a gripping, engrossing tale of otherworldly dimensions.  Beam me aboard.\n--D. Mikels, Esq.","summary":"Well Done","unixReviewTime":1338940800,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

The Blu-Ray is a definite 90% improvement, but there are scenes that don't really look much better that the original DVD.\n\nThis movie has always been hampered by the highly compressed nature of the audio, especially the score.  Unfortunately, what we have here is no improvement.  You would think that with all of the effort that goes into so-called \"ultimate\" versions, they could have gone in to touch-up some of the film's score.  Case in point, is over the end credits.  Compare what you hear with John Williams recording with the Boston Pops which includes the new material from the Special Edition version.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/By-Request-The-Best-Of-John-Williams-And-The-Boston-Pops-Orchestra\/dp\/B0000040YP\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">By Request: The Best Of John Williams And The Boston Pops Orchestra<\/a>&nbsp;The difference is stunning.  But, alas...\n\nThere is one downside (and I admit that this is probably nit-picking) but Criterion's CAV laserdisc version was so wonderful since one could program (edit) the movie into what I (!) felt was the ultimate version.  With all 3 versions on the Blu-Ray, frankly, I do not find one to be completely satisfying.  If we only had the original version, there would be no issue; nothing to compare, too.  But, with 3 versions, one sees things that could have been improved to make (what I think) is a true ultimate version.  But, again, alas...\n\nI love this movie.  The excitement and sense of wonder has always given me goosebumps.

I was not living in North America at the time and saw it while on vacation from Britain. I'd seen no trailers or other publicity, so I came to it with no preconceptions whatever. I found the sense of wonder in the movie and the gradual drawing together of the threads to the climax to be fascinating; and the climax itself, on a giant screen, was awe-inspiring. I've never got quite the same feeling of magic from any other movie. It's 35 years since the movie burst upon the scene and evidence of its influence is still seen in numerous movies (most recently 'Super 8'), but nothing has quite matched the original. It is truly a seminal movie of the genre.\n\nThe drawback about seeing it on DVD is that, even with today's large-screen TVs, the movie needs a bigger stage to deliver maximum impact. It's still a wonderful film, one which I continue to enjoy after many, many viewings, but I'm so glad my first experience of it was in the theater, totally unprepared for what I was about to see.","summary":"A seminal movie","unixReviewTime":1323388800,"vote":null,"image":null}

It was a project very close and personal to him and after the box office success of Jaws (1975), he was able to receive respect and creative freedom in Hollywood and was finally able to make his dream film as his follow up. Released in Novemeber of 1977, Close Encounters may be one of the best examples of Spielberg's great storytelling abilities ans sensibilities. I find this to be one of the most hopeful films I have ever seen. When the film opens, we are presented with an unsettling set up, we feel uncertain and even frightened and by the end of the film, we learn to have faith in our existence.\n\nThe story is very simple, a ordinary family man sees a UFO and is planted a message. He then tries to put the pieces together and find what the message means. His wife and kids feel that he is losing his mind as he tries to figure out what his purpose is and why he was chosen. He senses that there is a location that is very important although he doesn't know why, he just knows that it means something. His family eventually leaves him and he is left to find the answer himself. He later discovers that a women he met earlier in the film received the same message and together they try to find the location and discover its purpose. It doesn't come easily though, it's a magical journey that ends with people learning to communicate and return to their inner child. You have to watch the film to understand what I mean.\n\nThis movie was very moving in a decade that just didn't have many of those. The 70s were confusing times where we had lost faith in the world. When the film begins, we are scared that something isn't right. You get the sense (or at least I did) that we are lost and there is no communication or trust and at the end of the film we learn to see our world and ourselves through innocence and love. It is clearly a fantasy film but unlike Star Wars, which was released the same year, this film is more of a statement. It's a beautiful film about as I say, childhood innocence. I always walk away from this film with hope that maybe we can change and maybe one day, we will learn to fully understand our own self and eventually, our universe.\n\nOne last thing, if you want to view this film, I would recommend the 1998 director's cut which I feel is the best version of this movie.","summary":"A moving fairy tale.","unixReviewTime":1319587200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Watch them question their lives and become infected with the promise of something more than their banal lives. This is a much more cerebral film than most other 'first contacts'. Here, we are promised something different, a learning experience, a chance of friendship.\n\nIt's all too rare to find movies with a positive resolution instead of cheering on a heroic character that might or might not deserve said cheer.

This Close Encounters of the Third Kind DVD set is affordable and it spoils you rotten! It has the 1977 theatrical version, the 1980 special edition, and the 1998 director's cut! Also, there's some extra features. I first saw Close Encounters when I rented a VHS tape from the video store in 1998. Roy(Richard Dreyfuss) encounters a UFO while stuck at a railroad crossing. He has a vision of a tower in his mind. Director Steven Spielberg succeeded in casting French film director Francois Truffaut as a French scientist. Melinda Dillon plays a single mother and lovely Terri Garr plays Roy's wife. The special effects by Douglas Trumbull, Greg Jein, Ralph McQuarrie, and Dennis Muren are superb. The animatronic extraterrestrials built by Carlo Rambaldi are first rate. John Williams' music score for Close Encounters of the Third Kind is flawless. The five note motif was spoofed by a school band on a TV show and in the 007 film Moonraker(1979). This film has the iconic scene with Roy making a tower with mashed potatoes. This scene was spoofed in UHF(1989) and The Simpsons.\n The 1977 version of Close Encounters shows Terri Garr listening to an officer talking about UFO's. The 1980 version of the film shows the bright, colorful inside of the mothership. Cary Guffey is quite good as a three year old who is kidnapped by aliens. Close Encounters came out in 1977; it had to compete with Star Wars. Both films were referenced in Independence Day(1996). Times have changed. Steven Spielberg directed War of the Worlds(2005) and that film showed us some nasty, malevolent aliens from Mars. In the 1970's and the 1980's, Spielberg was willing to show us optimistic tales of encounters with space aliens. Close Encounters is a keeper.","summary":"Close Encounters of the Third Kind(1977)","unixReviewTime":1308873600,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

The plot is quite simple: a group of people are inspired by UFOs to meet the aliens who changed their lives. However, the beauty is in how that simple plot is realized in the film. One thing this film gets right is its portrayal of first contact. It's a profound event. The people contacted by the aliens undergo dramatic changes in their lives. This makes the movie all the more emotionally compelling. By the end of the film, you feel like you've gone on an emotional journey as well.\n\nThe movie's slow pace and subtle cinematography are a nice change from most movies released nowadays. At over 2 hours, the movie crawls for most of the time presenting dialogue and images. Initially, that sounds like a recipe for disaster (or 2001 Space Odyssey) but it works really well in this context. Slowing the pace down allows viewers to feel like you're traveling with the characters and for the tension to build. It also makes the climax all the more rewarding.\n\nThe special effects still hold up pretty well and have been improved for this 30th anniversary edition. I haven't watched this on blu-ray so I don't know how the quality holds up there. I did think some of the blacks could have been cleaned up to remove some of the \"static,\" but I have to say it also gives the movie a nice \"older\" feel.\n\nOverall, this is a sci-fi classic and still probably the most realistic depiction of contact with aliens ever to come out of Hollywood.

As human beings, we have an innate sensibility of fearing the unknown as a defense mechanism to combat those things which could be hostile and threaten our existence, be they at the individual level or at the societal level. History is filled with examples, usually of a tragic nature, in which human beings perpetrate against each other the worst kinds of inhumanity in the name of fear, be it religious, economic, or political. In large conflicts, human beings on each side rationalize that their adversaries are heinous monsters intentionally engaging in wrong-doing as an act of evil. Both sides, in other words, believe they are on the side \"right\" and vilify the other. In this circumstance, all behavior is dictated by fear rather than wonder.\n\nCountered to this inbred \"fear\" is also the capacity to engage in wonder. Human beings are also infinitely curious, and our curiosity stems from a child-like desire of wanting to know, to understand, and even to touch that which may be different. Fear and wonder are very incompatible bedfellows which reside in each of us. It is a constant challenge for the human race to decide which emotion will have its say in terms of behavior: wonder or fear. Fear is about anger, stereotypes, barriers, burning bridges, and making war. Wonder is about happiness, trust, letting go, being curious, and being vulnerable; it may be ultimately linked to those emotions associated with love. In the brilliant SF film \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\", Spielberg and co. explore how these two opposing views clash in the midst of our \"third\" encounter with aliens from outer space.\n\nEarly on, the story draws the divisions between those characters driven by fear as opposed to those who are willing to throw off fear in favor of wonder. Claude Lacombe (Francois Truffaut) and David Laughlin (Bob Balaban) are the two investigators who are led around the world by the series of inter-connected coincidences which lead them to believe something extra-terrestrial is going on. They are in the wonder department. And so is Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), a mid-west suburbanite who has an amazing \"encounter\", as well as a little boy, Barry, in the same geographical region who is enthralled with the coming of the aliens.\n\nThe US military, Roy's wife Ronnie Nearie (Teri Garr) and their family, and at first Jillian (Melinda Dillon), the mother of the little boy, belong in the fear department. In a simultaneously poignant and revealing scene, when the aliens come to visit the little boy's house one night, his mother shuts all the doors. Then suddenly, Barry opens one of the doors revealing a splendor of light and magic spilling from beyond. Jillian runs to the door and quickly closes it. She will not forsake her child's safety for Barry's wonder and curiosity. Over and over, Barry displays a kind of innocent curiosity for the encounter while his mother can only react in fear. Lacking the fear of his mother, Barry eventually leaves the safety of his mother and joins the aliens.\n\nRonnie Neary not only can't understand Roy's mood-swing from his encounter, she doesn't want to know anything about it. Something has been planted in Roy's mind, presumably by the aliens during his encounter, and he can't reconcile the image and its meaning. But Ronnie only fears what she doesn't understand. Roy doesn't do himself any favors when he turns his family upside down, but neither does his family attempt to find out what's troubling him. Fear becomes her dominating emotion while Roy is desperate to understand. The US military acts similarly to Ronnie as they want no outside interference in regards to the alien encounters, and continually deny the presence of these encounters.\n\nUltimately, by film's end, we learn that all the fears of the characters have been unfounded, a delusion on their part. All consternation and trouble, which are usually required for a story to be compelling, were human-created and not of alien origin. The encounters were designed out of benevolence, not hostility. Only one character, that of Barry's mother, realizes her error and changes from one who is at first fearful to someone who is willing to embrace wonder.\n\nI believe fear rarely serves the human race. Certainly, fear has its place if a rhino is charging at you in the jungle. But if all human behavior is dictated by fear rather than a child-like wonder, we will miss out on some of the best of human experience, which I think may be Spielberg's point. The encounters and the close encounter of the third kind are only possible when human beings tear down the walls, throw down the barriers, and build bridges to the unknown. Certainly the unknown may be filled with snakes. But it could be filled with treasure also. The child risks falling by walking on two legs. Maybe adults should learn to do the same. Are we going to be a species who continually hides under the bed in the face of the unknown, or are we going to be the little boy who opens the door into the world of unknown wonders?","summary":"Wonder in the Face of Fear: One of Spielberg's Most Enduring Visions","unixReviewTime":1295308800,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

I have the Collectors Edition and know nothing about Bluray, though it seems there are many reviews that talk more about Bluray and techy stuff than about the story. I don't have bluray, and my DVD is just fine!  I very much enjoyed the 2nd disc Collectors Edition, and the discussions with Spielberg, the editors, artists, musicians, actors and others who made this such an enjoyable film.  Mainly because it was just so much FUN to watch!\n\nI give it more than 5 stars, as all the fantasy (fantastic) scenes were made without today's help from computers.  Everything they did was done without computers and it still looked real.  As much as I love Harry Potter, and I do,  I doubt it could have been made or even attempted without computers.\n\nI\"m glad I bought the 2 disk version because the 2nd disk explained so much about the making of the film and the selection of the characters.  The little boy in the film, now all grown up explains how such a little child was able to attain the expressions, the wide eyed looks and his adorable smile that a kitchen gone crazy might have frightened a child of his age (I think he was about 4).  (He was my favorite character.)\n\nTerry Garr was perfect in her role as the bewildered wife and Richard Dreyfus, perfect as the man whose mind had gone far off kilter so that he could follow a strange obsession placed there by the UFO, uh, characters.  Great music by John Williams (per usual) and Francois Truffaut, an excellent French actor and director brought a kind of scientific reality to the whole fantasy. Can there be UFOS?

I would hope they torture him up there for being such a bad father and husband. probe him good. I also dislike spielberg for commenting \"If we can communicate with beings from another planet peacefully then why not The Reds during the Cold War?\" something to that effect. Spielberg must be one helluva naive person to state something like that and believe it. I also believe that Aliens wouldn't come here, Humans are too dumb,why bother. And if they did come they would probably destroy us.\nI would never want to have an encounter, The movie itself is not bad,but you go back to one place(India) then another (Muncie,Indiana) why not focus on One place and one plot?

When Roy Neary is out at those R\/R tracks and is lost and has his Encounter of the 2nd kind, there is quite a lot of graininess going on. Also at the beginning in the sandstorm and for other \"night\" scenes... however, during the rest of the film the picture is really great. So, once again it looks as though the people doing the Blu-Ray transfer AGAIN cut corners and tried to save money by not applying the process to the whole film. - Bottom line, this is a great movie and I think I can overlook the fact it is not perfect and still enjoy all 3 versions.

It's an extreme thing to say, but the world in this film feels so entirely genuine and real because of the emotion we see conveyed on screen. The direction and writing is, of course, awesome. Special effects--still impressive, and almost more convincing than the stuff we see today. Beautiful cinematography, and the musical score is cosmic and moving.\n\nIf you think the movie starts out slow...just wait. It's the final act that makes the build up oh-so-worth it.

But if you have seen it (which you likely have), watch it again.

Dowling","reviewText":"This is a revised review of my previous...because I need to echo once again how amazing this set is.  Bluray is such an incredible, versatile, and exciting format.  Close Encounters is the kind of transfer which is why I bought a BD player to begin with.  It contains all three versions of the film, so if you're partial to one, it's here.  It has been so meticulously remastered that it looks like it came out last year.  It was like seeing it for the first time, every detail from the knick-knacks in the Neary home to the detailing on the alien craft are rendered beautifully.  Each film has 2 lossless sound options, which is almost unheard of.  A DTS-HD MA and a Dolby True HD 5.1.  I prefer the DTS, but both are very powerful.  Not only does it feature house-rattling bass, but ambient and directional effects are exhilarating.  Dialogue reproduction is crisp and spot on.  Simply put, it will never look or sound this good again.  It was restored from the original source.  This was the first of Spielberg's oeuvre to be released and the follow-up have not been disappointing.  \"Minority Report\" is a revelation, \"War of the Worlds\" and Saving Private Ryan\" ...all of these are demo-worthy, reference grade transfers.\n\nThe price has dropped on this set dramatically even from when I wrote my original review.  It is still one of my go-to discs to demo my blu-ray, so people can see what the format can do for a film that is 33 years old!  I cannot wait to see \"Jaws\" and \"A.I.\" added to the repertoire.  Close Enounters is not just a movie, but an experience.  It reminded us to look at the stars with awe and wonder and dream of the possibilities.  The story is expertly crafted and still relevant and relatable.  The fact this transfer is so spectacular makes it a new experience with all the awe and childlike wonder flooding back to me.  A must own for fans of the film and fans of blu-ray.","summary":"Best Blu-ray presentation I have seen yet.","unixReviewTime":1263600000,"vote":7.0,"image":null}

You likely, therefore, are more interested in how it all comes across on blu-ray:\n\nI got this a couple months back and I have been very impressed. For the obsessive (or just curious) there are multiple versions of the movie and you can even select to have an on-screen indication of whether or not each scene you are watching was in other versions or not. I am a bit of a purist and tend to like the theatrical version but there are good and bad things (relatively) to say about each version. In this case, you don't have to compromise...you get them all. They even include a card summarizing the different versions and their differences so you can choose before you hit 'play'.\n\nI disagree with another reviewer who felt the transfer was bad. I feel the picture is very sharp, way sharper than any way I have seen this in the past. For example, in prior versions early in the movie when the alien ships turn their lights out, you could only \"see\" the ship moving among the stars by seeing some brighter stars wink out, now you can see all the stars and the \"shadow\" of the ship has substance. The discs sound great as well.\n\nOverall, I am very impressed and recommend this to anyone, especially at this price (I paid quite a bit more than the current price and still feel I got a good value).","summary":"Better in Blu-Ray","unixReviewTime":1263168000,"vote":9.0,"image":null}

Roy Neary, played by Richard Dreyfuss, is a happy family man when, one night, a spaceship flys over him in his truck. This leads him to investigate the incident, with him ultimately losing everything he has, including his family; his investigation becomes a compulsion that even he can't control. The movie was one of the biggest blockbusters of the 1970's and is the best film that explores aliens and the unknown.

The Offspring actually are in the film as a high school dance band, they play a cover of a Ramone's song I Wanna Be Sedated, and a few of their lesser big hit songs that non fans of theirs probably haven't heard before like Beheaded. But you don't have to have been a teen in the 90's to enjoy this teen aimed horror comedy.  And comedy is what it is, this isn't a movie taking itself seriously or trying to scare you or freak you out.  It's a stoner slacker 90's movie with the horror element of a hand of the town's laziest pothead (Devon Sawa) becoming possessed and becoming a serial killer, starting with the teen's own mum and dag (Fred Wilard, Frank Dunphy in Modern Family) only he's so out of it he doesn't catch on they're dead for a while.  When he does he tries rather unsuccessfully to stop it doing what it wants to do which includes killing his stoner friends (Seth Green and Elden Henson).  But his stoner friends are too lazy to walk up the stairs into the light so their corpses come back with the injuries they sustained.  He's also trying to stop his hand from killing the girl (Jessica Alba) in the house across the street who he's always had a crush on but has been to shy to talk to.\n\nIt's a really fun movie.  Sawa does a great performance fighting his hand, there are times when he has some long bits of dialogue while he's looking at the camera or another character and fighting his hand at the same time, that you try just doing the hand part yourself while watching and your arm and wrist becomes quite sore after a while, so it's actually quite impressive what he achieves. Seth Green and Elden Henson as slacker zombies also are brilliant. Jack Noseworthy also brilliantly plays one of those 30 year olds who still trying to score with high school chicks, hanging around bowling alleys and fast food outlets in his oversized wheeled Ford .  He has a line to one, \"still in high school, yeah I left a few years ago myself\" which is hilarious when he doesn't seem to realise they know exactly how old he is.  But it's the canine actor who steals the show early on.  His mouth is shaped to just look like he's giving a what the? expression well when his stoned master is doing weird stuff.  When he's not moving getting pushed on the tiles in front of the scared slacker teen, with his head moving around saying I don't want to be doing this, as he is being used as a shield if there's an intruder is also extremely well done on the dog's part.  The actor's probably not with us anymore nearly twenty years into the future, but I'd love to know what other movies he appeared in to check them out.  The only actors (and it's probably more so the script than them) were the two cops, who didn't seem realistic at all.\n\nOn the region 4 DVD there is also a deleted scene from near the end, it has an intro by the director which goes on for a little long explaining why it's not in the film and they reshot the ending. It takes place at the pool in the high school.","summary":"What a Fun Film!","unixReviewTime":1497398400,"vote":null,"image":null}

I admired the \"brilliant\" UFO designs, and the stunning performance of Richard Dreyfuss. Now, I can see that this film hasn't experienced any wear and tear, except maybe the commercial products that were used in the film. The special effects are still mesmerizing, the characters are still engaging, and even though I'm a fan of John Williams, the otherworldly music is still spectacular. Francois Truffaut steals the show as Claude Lacombe, but Dreyfuss is also worthy of mention. He plays Roy Neary, a man who has just had a \"close encounter\" with a trio of unidentified flying objects, and is becoming increasingly obssessive with a mountain-like shape that he seems to see in everyday objects. He should have won the oscar for this film, instead of \"The Goodbye Girl.\"\n\nThank goodness that Star Wars, which was released in theaters in the same year, didn't overshadow this arguably important sci-fi film.

I think that music and scoring was, perhaps used much more effectively in this time period. The effects, even for an older film, were outstanding and with a little suspension of disbelief-convincing. The space ship at the end is just incredible, as is the return of the other \"abductees\". This is a great story, and masterpiece by Spielberg.

This film has many signs to show that it was influenced by Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" from the opening sequence to the massive role of music to the whole feel of the movie and yet Spielberg did not simply copy Kubrick's formula but instead took the genre on to another level putting his own stamp on it.  Franchises like The \"X-Files\" and many others have at least been influenced themselves by this film and the special effects are spectacular for the time given there was little if any CGI to the scale of today and yet the visual effects hold up very well even by today's standards.\n\nThis one-disc Collector's Edition is also a real treat for fans as it has been restored very, very well for an excellent picture and sound quality.  I watched this in DTS surround and anamorphic video and the impact was fabulous!  I finally did justice to my system as it gave all my speakers a great workout.  I tried to find picture imperfections but in vain.\n\nThe only reason I gave this 4 stars is because there are no Special Features to speak of and for that you'll need to get the 2-Disc version.  For those who just want a great Director's Cut version of this film and are happy with just the one disc like myself, this is a very good dvd version to get.\n\nHighly recommended!","summary":"Spielberg's Masterpiece!

I didn't get to see the interior of the ship at the end, but I did see the scene in which Dreyfuss tears up his yard to construct a replica of the mountain in his visions; that may provide a clue to those who are more knowledge about this movie than I.  There may be a superior version of this film out there, but I enjoyed this one quite a bit.  No one can convey that sense of wonder better than Stephen Spielberg at his best.  The story structure is very effective, alternating between the intellectually stimulating narrative of two scientists (Francois Truffaut and Bob Balaban) who are investigating the unusual phenomena and the intense, personal stories of two people who don't understand what is happening to them.  The wonderful finale provides a nice contrast to most science fiction films, which are really teched up action flicks with violent endings.","summary":"From the man who invented the summer blockbuster","unixReviewTime":1228867200,"vote":null,"image":null}

It isn't a downer, and it isn't the kind of movie that makes you think about the world's problems. Even the US government seems to have the best intentions when it comes to the aliens. The whole movie wears a little smirk on it's face.  Masterfully done, Encounters has some simple but effective visual effects and a emotional and powerful soundtrack. The casting is good considering it was early in the careers of several of the people involved. Richard Dreyfuss plays his character perfectly. Roy Neary is a regular joe that suddenly is confronted with some life changing events that he can't understand. The messages that he is getting in his head confuse him all the more and Dreyfuss does a perfect job of illustrating that.  The supporting cast turns in good performances as well and really give the impression that you are watching a documentary rather than a work of fiction. The best parts of the movie in my opinion is when they are showing you clips from around the world of different UFO encounters and the research team finding evidence of an alien presence. When they're in the Mongolian desert and they find the freighter Cotopoxi. The same ship that was lost for real in the Bermuda Triangle. It still gives me chills. They slowly pan across and you see a huge ship sitting in the middle of the sand. Oooooh man, great shot.  Bottom Line: This is another one of Spielberg's classics. You must get it on DVD for the multitude of extras that are on the 2 disc set. If you haven't seen it yet and you like either UFO's and\/or Spielberg, you won't be disappointed.","summary":"A magical Spielberg story","unixReviewTime":1220313600,"vote":null,"image":null}

The first release on DVD still had three scenes missing from the 1977 version that I saw on the theaters.  I did miss seeing the man with his family commenting on how far behind the aliens was in technology when it came to our highway systems.  I also miss Ray wife (Teri Carr) complaining that she was not going to get a job and Ray looking at the pillow and seeing the mountain shape in it.  The third scene was included with the outtakes.  It was the scene with Ray walking into the Electric Power Plant (his job) and talking to his co-workers.\n\nThe first two scenes were not in the outtakes so the movie was missing something.  These two scenes were less than a minute each but they really stood out in the film.  I had to wait 30 years for this movie to be release the way I originally saw it in the theater in 1977.\n\nIf you enjoy the 1980 re-release version of this film it is also in this package and so is the release 1997 DVD copy.

At the same time, a multinational group of scientists investigating a series of mysterious events begin preparations for the first diplomatic visit from extraterrestrials.\n\nSo the film is a classic. What about the disc? First, this is the only Blu-ray I've come across that doesn't have that cheesy blue plastic top.

OK, it's not perfect, but what is?  It's such a fascinating story.  The transfers look great on my 51\" HDTV, and the sound is fine given the film's age.  Over the years, I have bought a CLV Criterion LD, another version on LD that is a terrible transfer, the standard DVD, and now the Blu-Ray.  I have one complaint.  I don't like any of Spielberg's cuts.  I believe this would be a better movie if EVERY scene was present except the entry into the ship, which is a meaningless light show and which Spielberg was forced to do against his better judgment.  Why not offer a version with all the cuts present and allow the owner to deselect the unwanted ones?  The CAV Criterion LD offered that feature a quarter-century ago but at a $130 premium.  The nature of the cuts is such that the movie should still flow well.  Hence, four stars instead of five.\n\nIs there a fourth version of this film?  When I saw it at the theater in January 1978, I remember seeing the power plant AND the ship-in-the-desert scene AND the Wyoming scene with the future \"Apollo Creed,\" which appear together in none of these versions.  When I bought the Criterion version, I remember being disappointed at not seeing them.  However, Spielberg insists he didn't film the ship-in-the-desert scene until later, so I suppose he knows his own history.\n\nThe extras disc is fascinating in that you see actors whose principle work fell to the cutting room floor.  You also get to witness some very bad movie making that fortunately never saw the light of day except here.

Goldberg","reviewText":"How well I remember walking out of the theatre in 1976, and looking up at the sky as if it were a living thing! CE3K remains a beautiful metaphor for all that is unknown. For many of us, the first question will be, \"Did Steven ditch that interior of the Mothership?\" Happily, it was the first cut he made. All the good stuff is here, edited more tightly by an admittedly older and less credulous director. Yet despite his avowed \"maturity\" (read skepticism), his Director's Cut is delicious, loving, and as full of wonder as ever. I know this is unpopular: I love Spielberg for his lyricism, his poetry, and his willingness to take us \"out there.\" \"Private Ryan\" was quite well-made. I've never gotten through Schindler. But in CE3K, ET, Jurassic Park, Always and others, Steven has shown me things I've always wanted to see. Though much of his industry recognition has come from his more recent work, it's always been his forays into fantasy that seemed so redolent of truth to me. In the Director's Cut, he shows that the boy within the man is still alive and luminous. Dreyfuss has never had a better turn (arguable, admittedly, when one thinks of \"Mr. Holland's Opus,\" a more mature tour-de-force for him) and Melinda Dillon is the ultimate feminine archetype. Can't recommend this highly enough. The decision to split the newer \"extras\" into three parts, across the DVDs is inconvenient, and a small matter in the face of this wonderful release.\n\nAnd if you like that dreadful UFO interior, it's on the second DVD.

It allows them to go back play with, alter, tamper and second guess themselves. We get three versions via seamless branching on Blu-ray on one disc with a disc of extras and the films presented with extras over three discs on DVD allowing us to see Spielberg's thoughts on \"CE3K\" over three different decades. The latest 30th Anniversary edition allows writer\/director Steven Spielberg to fix flaws in \"CE3K\" that have bothered him for years about the film. The original theatrical version editing he felt was rushed and unfinished while the \"Special Edition\" deleted some key scenes and added a completely unnecessary trip inside the Mothership (something he later regretted). --he's edited it again (it's 2 minutes longer with some scenes lengthened and others shortened plus the trip inside the Mothership has been left to the audience's imagination). The \"Director's Cut\" works better than both versions; Spielberg has licked some of the pacing issues that dogged the original film and he has eliminated the gaudy trip inside the ship. For those fans who HAD to see the inside of the ship we still get that edition of the film which is a good thing--this is the most comprehensive version of \"CE3K\" released. This is the definitive version(s)of the film.\n\nInterestingly, Spielberg added the last section inside the ship so he could get the financing to re-edit the film for the 1980 re-release. It was a compromise he could live with at the time but he has since reversed that opinion wisely realizing that focus groups (Columbia's marketing department got focus group feedback asking to see the inside of the ship and that's where the decision to show the inside came from)can be idiots and cause damage to a film (see \"Blade Runner\" for an example of how it can compromise a film).\n\nThe image quality is spectacular on Blu-ray and looks terrific on DVD as well. I have to give Spielberg credit; unlike, say, George Lucas, Spielberg presents his original vision with as much respect and care as he does his later revisions. You can pick and choose which version appeals to you--I liked the original version a lot in 1977, disliked the 1980 \"Special Edition\" and loved the \"Director's Cut\" of the film. What was subtle in the first version was blunt in the second and has been returned to subtle in the third version with better pacing and cuts that work better with the flow of the film. Fans of the film will love having all 3 versions so they can pick and choose which version they like.\n\nAudio sounds terrific as well with an active 5.1 mix presented in DTS and Dolby Digital Surround. The Blu-ray also features the sound presented in lossless uncompressed TrueHD Dolby. John Williams' soaring and uplifting score is beautifully rendered.\n\nThe Blu-ray uses an interactive comparison feature \"A View from Above\" that has a pop up color\/shape to tell you when there is a difference in a scene. It is color co-ordinated to which version has a difference and also to which version you are watching. It shows an image from the scene and explains what was altered. We also geta hard copy of that as well for both the Blu-ray and DVD with a \"map\" explaining the differences between the three versions and, on the other side, a reproduction of the original, effective poster (which also was used as a teaser trailer and is on the cover of the box)from 1977.\n\nThere is also a storyboard to scene comparison section as well as conceptual art done by Ralph McQuarie (who also worked on \"Star Wars\" and \"Alien\" coming up with designs for various aliens and spaceships). Complimenting these sections on storyboards and artwork is a companion 30th anniversary scrapbook. We get brief biographies and backgrounds for the key players in the film and behind-the-scenes as well as comments from Spielberg about the project and behind-the-scenes photos.\n\nPorted over we get the extensive 1997 documentary on the making of the film as well as an interview with Spielberg from 2007 discussing his thoughts on the film, the changes he made and where the film fits for him now 30 years later as a film director. The original 1977 \"Watch the Skies\" featurette that played on TV as a promotional tie-in is included as well. A number of deleted scenes are also included. Finally we get the various theatrical trailers with the original teaser (that didn't show any scenes from the film but was compelling and artistic by itself) included as well.\n\nAll of this is housed in a sturdy cardboard case for both the Blu-ray and DVD. This set is highly recommended on both DVD and Blu-ray since it houses the ultimate edition and allows viewers to pick the version of the film they enjoyed the most. It's also a way for Spielberg to have his cake and eat it, too.","summary":"Spielberg's classic film in THREE different versions--1977 original, 1980 \"Special Edition\" and 2007 \"Director's Cut\"","unixReviewTime":1200700800,"vote":9.0,"image":null}

Beaupain","reviewText":"Following in Lucas's footsteps with his release of the original Star Wars as it was first presented. Spielberg does his sci-fi epic the same way with this excellent release of the 1977 UFO Classic, Close Encounters of the Third Kind. When it was first released on video back in the early 80's it was the Special Edition version which was released to theaters in 1980 with new end footage with the interiors of the Mother Ship as well as other scenes edited out entirely and replaced with other scenes or alternate versions of other scenes. In fact, the only way to ever see the original was when it aired on TV as a movie and even then the two versions were combined to fill a 3 hour time slot. In the 1990's Laserdisc owners were the first to be able to own the original version thanks to Criterion Collection laserdiscs, except that the end credits were from the 1980 version. Then in 2001, the Collector's edition came out and it was more of a marriage of the two versions as it still eliminated key scenes from the original version, yet restored the original\nending.  The Best part of this DVD set is that it pleases everyone. It has the original, complete with restored original 1977 end credits ( for the first time, The Special Edition, and the collector's edition and loads of special features including the extended teaser trailer for the first film, the trailer for the second and the advertising trailer for this ultimate colection edition.  The sound is presented in 5.1 Dolby and DTS format on all 3 discs. If you have the right stereo equipment, you could play the original in its original stereo sound format...but why. I'm all for nostalgia but this is one of those movies where you need to have the subwoofer active, especially at the final scenes where the mother ship blows out the glass in the observation tower. The video quality is also superb. I can only imagine what this film sounds like and looks like on the BLU-RAY version also available and for about the same price as this set through online discount retailers.  A must for any Spieleberg fan.\nA little bit of trivia regarding both Star Wars and CE3K is that at the time of the release, both directors were reportedly in Hawaii, discussing the possibileity that their indiviual movies would flop  Both films were very succesful. And the projct they were discussing at theat time was another great franchise...the beginnings of what became to be Raiders of the Lost Ark.","summary":"The Original on DVD at last......","unixReviewTime":1200009600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Movies like Star Wars had just come out and the idea of bringing UFO's to life was becoming possible.  Now thirty years later movies like this seem very simple.  Although the story never grows old and now in hi-def it is well worth another look.\n\nFrom the minute I got my hands on this set I realized how nice it actually is.  Containing just two discs but hours worth of features.  The first disc contains the movies in three different editions.  The Original Theatrical Version contains the movie how it was originally seen on the big screen.  Special Edition is the same version that was released several years ago with a few additional features that was added to the Theatrical Version.  The Director's Cut contains additional parts of the movie that were Steven Spielberg intended to be in his movie.  For all of you confused don't worry the set comes with a high quality glossy timeline sheet with the extra parts that were added to each edition.  On this disc you are also given an option to run the movie with all the extras.  So essentially you have four versions of this film.\n\nWhen I started watching this movie I was in awe.  This was one of the best hd transfers of a movie I have ever seen.  I have watched numerous movies over ten years old and this one looked best.  The color and visuals looked superb.  The sound is superb and the way it was intended to sound.\n\nFor those of you who have never seen the movie it involves several characters.  A group of scientists are researching strange discoveries that are taking place like a fleet of WWII planes that went missing thirty years prior.  The discoveries are just the beginning as UFO's begin to make appearances all over the world.  Richard Dreyfuss is one of the people who witnesses the UFO activity and from that point his life is changed.  Trying to discover what the meaning of this is.  Of course in the meantime his family and work life are completely disrupted.  Although this is just the beginning of this mysterious journey.\n\nClose Encounters is a magical movie to say the least.  The story is timeless and has been copied for many years without the same success.  The special effects have improved greatly over the years but movie still remains a classic.  Now on Blu-ray this movie gives people a whole new reason to own it.  The extras make it well worth it.

Many others see these craft including Gillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon from A Christmas Story) whose son is later abducted by the aliens.  At the same time, a group of researchers who apparently work for the government travels around the world gathering information on various alien sightings and encounters.  All of this comes together when everyone converges on one spot to find... well, that's the question that plagues all of them.\n\nThe government researcher scenes tend to be chaotic and confusing.  It's not unusual to have to sit through a few minutes of incomprehensible material before you can finally understand what's going on at the very end of the scene.  They also didn't add a whole lot to the film, especially given the amount of time they take up.  The plot line involving Roy Neary is the most interesting.  After his encounter, he's driven by strange compulsions but he doesn't understand what they mean or how to deal with them.  His family gets pretty freaked out, especially his wife (Teri Garr).  If his wife wasn't screaming all the time, this would have been a great story, but she gets old very quickly.\n\nThe climax of the film involves a light show that lasts about twenty minutes as various alien ships dart around, hover, and finally land.  They then play a rousing tune for a few minutes to communicate even though they give the earthmen no way whatsoever to put the notes into any meaning or context.  It felt like an endless nightmare watching this scene drag on and on before it was finally over.  I'm fine with a peaceful encounter but this could have been done in one fourth the time with absolutely nothing lost.\n\nIt's difficult for me to recommend this movie.  For hard-core sci fi or Spielberg fans, you should see it once for yourself because it is one of the milestones in the genre.

Spreitzer","reviewText":"Just thought I would bring a matter to the attention of those interested in this set, especially those who already own it. Though of course each of the three versions of CE3K are offered with the DTS audio option in the languages menu (as was the case with the original DVD release) the set I own returns to the default Dolby Digital 5.1. And it is the case with ALL THREE of the discs. I highlight \"DTS 5.1\", then select play, and trying this numerous times, but is still playing in DD 5.1. Just in case, to check to see whether if it is my Pioneer DVD player that is acting up, I tried several other DVDs (including the above-mentioned first DVD release of CE3K) and they are accepting the selection. So my question to any owners of this set would be: Does anyone else experience this, or might I regard this as just a isolated defect for the set I own? I do plan to exchange the set to see if another one would have this same issue. Though I feel the DD 5.1 quite adequate in most instances, I do find (to my ears at least) that the DTS audio is often more rich and has a more seamless surround perspective. Regardless of one's preference, I want of course what I pay for in any product, per the advertisement.\n\nAnyone else encounter this problem? Feedback on this issue will be greatly appreciated from fellow CE3K enthusiasts.\n\nAs an aside--I do prefer the original theatrical version as the best of the three offered, but it's neat to have all three available, and the poster diagram included (reverse of the great theater poster) is useful to refer to at, at least initially to sort out the cuts and additions.","summary":"Where's The DTS?","unixReviewTime":1197244800,"vote":null,"image":null}

I later bought the ultimate director's cut LD (the same ultimate director's cut on this release) and was really disappointed at the low level of detail even though the sound was really good. I resisted buying the DVD because that I didn't want to buy it again while not being certain that the picture would be really great. LDs' sound have always put the sound on DVDs to shame. So I waited for a Superbit version of the film but it never came. When I saw that it would be released on Blu-ray I simply jumped at the change and pre-ordered it right away.\nWhen the discs arrived I was extremely pleased that the picture at last was of a quality that the film deserves. There are film grain visible but it doesn't matter since almost all 35mm releases have visible film grain on Blu-ray disc (I expect the same is true of HD DVD releases too). The picture was quite simply magnificent, the level of detail was very rich and the colors were very vibrant. The colors of the picture of BD releases is what I really am impressed with and this movie shines.\nThe sound was a little different matter. I use a PS3 to watch BD movies with an optical cable to my Yamaha amp with only Dolby Digital decoder (no DTS decoder) so when I watch the movies I use the DD track if available. The DD core of the Dolby TrueHD track was only 448 kbps instead of 640 kbps (all other Dolby TrueHD titles that I have have a 640 kbps DD core) and it was a little underwhelming, being the same sound quality as the DD track on DVDs. But when I set up my PS3 to decode the Dolby TrueHD track as a 2 channel LPCM track the soundtrack really excelled. The film originally was mixed in Dolby surround so to use the surround processor on my amp to play the surround sound in mono on my back speakers didn't bother me. The detail in the sound, especially at the end of the film, was so rich. I know this is not a fair assessment of the Dolby TrueHD sound, but Sony should have but a 640 kbps core on the TrueHD track, like with the Spider-man trilogy. I am really looking forward to getting an amp with HDMI input to process the true HD sound from both Dolby TrueHD and uncompressed PCM BDs (and DTS-HD MA when the PS3 can decode it).\n\nThe extras were basically the same as on my old LD Sony release with a great in-depth documentary on the making of the movie, the special edition (released in 1980) and director's cut. It also included a new 2007 interview with Spielberg reflecting on the movie after 30 years (the documentary was made in 1997, 20 years after the original release). In the case there was a booklet with some text on the making of the film with lots of pictures and a fold out with the film poster on one side and on the other side there is a outline of the differences of the three versions of the film with three timelines (one for each version) and notes pointing to various points with comments. What I really miss is a commentary track with Spielberg on each of the versions. I don't think that there is a single movie of his that has a commentary track on either BD or DVD. It would be perfect with a commentary track.\n\nAs it stands this release is really good. Some have complained on the lack of a BD plastic cover and I can understand it but with this content it is well worth the price (some have complained on that too) and I would recommend this release to all sci-fans.\n\nAddition on 17. January 2008:\nI have since I reviewed it bought an amp with HDMI to hear the uncompressed PCM sound from my PS3. I must say how that the sound is truly  amazing. It is so full and detailed. The bass, especially in the scene with Dreyfuss in the truck in the beginning, is truly spectacular. The sequence at the end behind Devil's Tower is a feast for the ear. I have only been able to get the HD sound from the Dolby TrueHD track but I would expect the DTS HD-MA track is equally impressive since both is a lossless format.","summary":"An almost perfect release of a magnificent sci-fi movie","unixReviewTime":1197072000,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

Here are a few reasons why I think this is my favorite version of any movie I've purchased.\n\n1.) Main Menu. The main menu resembles the light display form the end of the film and the lights blink in time with the notes of the music. While this isn't a huge deal, it shows the level of detail that the producers of this version went to in order to make the ownership experience better. While the lights play in time to the music, scenes from the film appear across the light rectangle, giving a glimpse into what you're about to watch.\n\n2.) Soundtrack. The DTS ES soundtrack is amazing and I think this is the first time this film has been given the DTS-ES treatment. Deep rumbling bass for the ships remind me of some of the things that made me love this movie when I saw it when I was only 12 years old.\n\n3.) Image. Holy cow! It hasn't looked this good since 1977! Colors are rich and the print is pristine. There are some minor artifacts in a few sections, like when Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) is being questioned in the government trailer, but they look like film grain issues not compression artifacts.\n\n4.) Content. The two-disc set is loaded with features. The best of these is the \"View From Above\" setting, which shows you interactively where scenes differ from the original 1977 version. A text sentence and small image are displayed when something differs, giving a terrific, at-a-glance look at the differences among the three versions of the film. With three versions, it's hard to keep all the changes straight just looking at the included full-color, printed chronology but the on-disc version of this is stellar. Simply the best presentation I've seen.\n\n5.) Extras. The original 1977 featurette and a new, 30th anniversary documentary are included along with trailers. This disc is loaded! The interviews with Spielberg were riveting, and Richard Dreyfuss, Teri Garr, Melinda Dillon and \"one-take\" Cary (Child \"Barry\" in the movie) all provide terrific insight to how this was made. On top of that you get a full-color reproduction of the movie poster with a chronology of the three versions on the back-side. The poster measures about 13 x 17, but that's not exact I didn't use a ruler I'm eyeballing. There's also a full-color booklet (about 30 pages) outlining the creation of the movie with some great behind the scenes photos.\n\nIn short, this disc had everything I could've wanted and more.","summary":"An amazing set!","unixReviewTime":1196035200,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

At 39 years old I was really hoping to see some of my favorite movies in this new HD format.  Some movies seem to really benefit from this format (Kubrick's re-releases, Fifth Element, etc.).  And some movies don't seem to take full advantage of the HD format.\n\nSo it is with great pleasure that I say that this edition of Close Encounters of the Third Kind is quite simply \"amazing!\"  Yes, the film is 30 years old.  And some grain is to be expected.  But wow, what a transfer!  The colors pop off the screen.  The contrast is nice and sharp, but not in a bad way.  The dark scenes are virtually flawless.  The color tones and overall look of the entire film is breahtaking.  The audio easily makes this a reference Blu Ray disc and will really test your system.\n\nI'm not sure how much of the look of this film is due to the recent digital remastering and how much is simply due to the HD format, but the end result is enough to give you goose bumps.\n\nThe movie may be 30 years old, but this transfer makes it look as though it was released this year.\n\nWorth noting is, thanks to the Blu Ray format, this release is just two discs (not 3 discs as in the standard def format).  All three versions of the film (original Theatrical release, Special Edition release, and the edition for this set, Director's Cut) are ALL on the first disc.  Disc two contains all the special features.  And there's hours of non-filler, must-watch stuff on this disc too. A 2007 interview with Spielberg and cast talking about the versions, an almost 2-hour documentary from Collector's Edition release, 42 minute \"Making of\" documentary.  After watching all the special features I want to go back and watch the film again.\n\nThe Director's Cut seems to be the one to watch since it is Speilberg's idea of the how the movie should look.  Worth noting is the deirector's cut of the movie removes the scene inside the mother ship.  Wich Speilberg admits in the special features was a compromise with the studio to fund a few extra scenes for the Special Edition.  (The \"Director's Cut\" is a combination and re-cut of the original release and the special edition.)\n\nIn colclusion, a fantastic release that seems to embrace the benefits that the Blu Ray format offers.  A stunning and breathtaking transfer of an already great movie.  The transfer is so good that you'll feel like you're watching it for the first time all over again.  I suspect this release will be in most Blu Ray owner's libraries.","summary":"A must-own Blu Ray Title!","unixReviewTime":1195862400,"vote":62.0,"image":null}

Wolters","reviewText":"Close Encounters of the Third Kind remains at the top of my list of my all time favorite movies. It has invoked a sense of wonder that no movie has ever come close to. And now that we have the 30th anniversary edition on DVD, we finally get to experience the movie in the original release as well as the two other cuts.\n\nThe movie involves the government searching for UFO evidence and the everyday people who see the UFO's who didn't go seeking them. While the government searches merely on scientific facts to make contact, the \"everyman\" characters develop an artistic talent either through art or music to lead them to contact. Those two sides finally clash before both making contact and realizing how they came together and how they were all \"invited\" to make contact.\n\nI think what makes this movie so special for me is how little you see of the UFO's during the entire movie and how it affects the characters throughout the film. Then we are rewarded with the best final 20 minutes of any film made since. And the music...not just the \"5 notes\" but the entire soundtrack by John Williams is so haunting and is a character in itself.\n\nHaving the original edition again is a thrill and I believe I have to give it the edge, though the \"Director's Cut\" is a very close second. The Director's Cut has the better Neary introduction but everything else I like better in the original cut. Don't ask me why, but the pillow scene was always a haunting scene and I liked it. And I like the order of the scenes between Roy and the government officials better. Though, as a whole, the director's cut isn't bad at all, I just like the original. When I was younger, I was thrilled to hear about the Special Edition to see \"inside the mothership.\" And as a kid, I loved those scenes but was so unhappy that the building of Roy's Devil's Tower was left out and as a result, it ruined the movie for me. Now, I am glad the mothership inside scene was removed from the Director's Cut as it does take away the sense of wonder if what it would be like from our minds.\n\nClose Encounters has stood the test of time and it is a film that always will and could never be remade.","summary":"Still The Best Movie I've Ever Seen","unixReviewTime":1195084800,"vote":23.0,"image":null}

You get all three cuts, all remastered in 5.1 surround and all have been digitally transferred. Thank you so much Mr. Spielberg because this without a doubt has to be one of your best (along with the original ET).\n\nLast night, I watched the original theatrical version and forgot how much was removed for the \"Special Editions\" and the final \"Director's Cut\". In my mind, the original version is the best and to finally have it in all it's uncut 5.1 surround sound (which didn't exist back then) glory is simply wonderful.\n\nThe packaging is nice, although I found it very difficult to remove the DVDs without fearing I might snap them because the locking mechanism seems to not want to let go of the DVDs no matter how hard I press down on them. I suppose I could look at it in that I shouldn't fear them coming off during shipping and getting scratched up.\n\nThe box is nicely designed and inside are some wonderful items. It comes with a poster that gives a time line for each movie and where each cut differs which I found really interesting. It also comes with a book full of bios on the actors and other people that worked on the film. Plenty of in-movie and behind-the-scene shots. Finally, the three DVDs are housed in a tri-fold container. Inside and outside are colorful shots from the movies and it really makes the entire set look nice.\n\nIn addition to the three editions of the movies, there is also a new \"30 Years\" documentary looking back over time at how CE has been a favorite movie that has stood the test of time. Also, the making-of documentary that was on the original Director's Edition that came out a few years ago has been split across the three DVDs. Also included is the 1977 making of documentary which was also on the previously released Director's Cut DVD.\n\nMissing are all the \"deleted\" scenes that were included on the Director's Cut. So, if you own that one, it might be best to keep it since they are absent from this edition.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent release and no one should be without it. To finally watch it like I did when it first came out back in 1977 (and I lived in Muncie, Indiana at that time so you can just imagine what the crowd did when that came up during the movie) was so refreshing and wonderful that I can't wait to watch it again!","summary":"I wished upon a star and my dream came true!","unixReviewTime":1195084800,"vote":209.0,"image":null}

This is one that could be enjoyed even by those who hate science fiction films.  The plot is amazing and, in my opinion, this film needs to be regarded as the standard setting sci-fi film of the 70's, just as 2001: A Space Odyssey was in the 60's.  Also, the acting was just astounding, especially on the part of Richard Dreyfus.\n\nIn conclusion I wanted to add in response to the reviewer below that it is more like good riddance to a witch of a wife.  Teri Garr did a splendid job of playing a wife who's head was completely in the sand and was not supportive of her husband at all.  I mean, if I had a loser wife like this, then I would be really tempted, alien encounter or not, to trash my living room and build a replica of Devil's Tower in my living room so she would think I was crazy and would leave me... FOR GOOD!!  Or, better yet, have the aliens abduct her, harvest her organs so they could see what a LOUSY EARTHLING WIFE IS MADE OF!!\n\nAnyway, all ranting aside, this film is highly entertaining very awe-inspiring.","summary":"Superb Sci-Fi masterpiece from Spielberg.

Some people knock on this movie for lacking true horror but clearly Idle Hands was not meant to be a true horror film. If you want true horror over comedy horror, then skip on this and watch The Blair Witch Project or something.\n\nAnton Tobias' is a slacking high school stoner who has no motivation in life and gets through his problems with the simple use of weed and a bong. When his parents end up mysteriously dead a few days before Halloween, Anton becomes the prime suspect; although he has no recollection of ever committing such a heinous act. He enlists the aid of his two equally lazy friends; Pnub and Mick to help him track down the killer, but when he ends up killing them off, Anton realizes that his right hand has become possessed by the Devil .\n\nAs multiple more killings follow; fellow high school student, Debi LeCure is on the hunt for who or what is committing the murders. Anton must then team up with his neighborhood crush across the street, Molly (the beautiful Jessica Alba) to find a way to tame his possessed hand before it kills anyone else. Will he be able to stop his evil hand? Who else will become a victim? Can Anton find the courage to ask Molly to the high school's Halloween Prom Dance?\n\nOverall: Idle Hands is a really enjoyable film beginning, middle, and end. Once again, it's a comedy horror film; so if you're expecting this to be a serious horror movie, don't buy it. The plot is great for it's time and the cast is entertaining. They couldn't have chosen a better group of people to put in this movie.","summary":"A Great Addition To Add To Your Collection","unixReviewTime":1407715200,"vote":null,"image":null}

How could you possibly make sense of a film like this?  Steven Spielberg really messed up this time around, making a movie about space and yet most of it takes place on earth.

This one, I guess.\n\nIf you like to see movies about Richard Dreyfus playing with carbs, then you'll love Close Encounters.  And special effects?  I don't know why they're considered so revolutionary because they're not half as good as anything I saw in ID4 (that's what I call Independence Day) or MIB II (Men in Black II) or iRobot or even Wild Wild West.  Apparently in Steven Spielberg's mind all space aliens are going to terrorize our planet after they arrive in a big Simon (complete with flashing colored lights and the annoying four musical notes)\n\nThe best thing about this movie is that it ends (sadly after 6 1\/2 hours of people climbing on mountains and staring into the sky).

I have rediscovered it now, thanks to DVD, and am kicking myself for not getting better acquainted with it after all these years. It isn't a stretch to say that Close Encounters may be the best Alien movie. Spielberg also wrote the film(and why hasn't he written a truckload more?), and it's a wonderful accomplishment still after 30 years. The great Richard Dreyfuss stars as Roy Neery, a middle class, suburban husband and father who has a 'close encounter' when UFO's begin to come into his town of Muncie, Indiana. And what a great scene that is!. Roy and a few others, including single mom Melinda Dillon(A Christmas Story), end up with a connection to the UFO's as the aliens inside try to make contact with earthlings. Spielberg has a great sense of feeling and wonder thru the entire film. He shows us how this could be taken in two ways. One, he gives us the whimsical, fantastical, awe-inspiring side, and with a fantastic sequence in Dillon's house with her son, also gives us how this can be frightening and scary. One look at that scene and you can see how this movie heavily influenced Shyamalan's \"Signs\". The movie was made 30 years ago, but it holds up strongly. It's 30 year old story and effects are more affective than a lot of the films today with millions of dollars and fancy new technology. Dreyfuss is always good, and he's great here as Neery. Teri Garr plays his wife. The home life aspect of the fillm doesn't work for some, but it's part of what made the movie to me. Seeing how this normal, average joe gets sucked up in this obsession and how it starts to affect the family life. Garr doesn't get a whole lot here, but she seems to get across that she is a woman who doesn't know what to do. The late director Francois Truffaut plays a scientist, along with Bob Balaban, tracking the UFO's and the strange occurences that have happened around the world. The score by Spielberg mainstay, John Williams, is another success in his long cannon of work. Beautiful and haunting, and who will forget those few chords?. The end is still remarkably fresh and amazing, and the mother ship itself is more cool and impressive than a lot of what we can see nowadays in movies. It's grand entrance is still amazing and a great accomplishment in filmmaking. The smaller ships that come and go are equally fun and well done. Close Encounters has a lot of great things going for it. There are a number of great\/classic scenes, a wonderful score, good acting, and a sense of awe and wonder that Spielberg is so brilliant at capturing. You gotta love early, 1975-82, Spielberg. The fact that this movie remains to be so good and touching and amazing 30 years on and before all the studio money that goes out nowadays is a testament to the film and Spielberg's talents. A true classic.","summary":"This Is Something Important....","unixReviewTime":1178496000,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

Wood","reviewText":"On its thirtieth anniversary, Steven Spielberg's UFO masterpiece, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND (1977), seems as fresh and wondrous as a child's birthday present.  UFO's appear in the night skies over Indiana and kidnap little Cary Guffey.  His poor mom, Melinda Dillon, has no idea that the aliens are friendly.  Richard Dreyfuss sees the sightings also and all but ignores wife Teri Garr to follow them all over Indiana in a truck.  After Dreyfuss makes a giant mountain of earth in his living room without knowing why, Garr takes their son and leaves him.  But he's too busy trying to figure out what obsesses him about the mountain.\n\nThen Dreyfuss and Dillon realize at the same time what the mountain means--Devil's Tower in Wyoming.  But what is the mystery of Devil's Tower?  Pretty soon they are joining forces by truck to head for Wyoming.  What compels their journey?  I'm not even sure Spielberg, as writer and director, knows.  Over thirty years, he has re-edited his movie at least three times--from 135 minutes, to 132 minutes, to a Director's Cut of 137 minutes that leaves out several scenes I remember, including the inside of the space ship at the film's finale.  Anyway, our intrepid duo reach Devil's Tower.  Ironically, the Army arrest them as aliens!\n\nThe last third of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, secretly filmed in an Alabama warehouse, has some of the most spectacular visual effects in movie history and won Vilmos Zsigmond a Cinematography Oscar for his brilliant work, in tandem with at least five other cinematographers all over the world, including Douglas Slocombe in northern India.  (The great Douglas Trumbull gets Visual Effects credit, along with Spielberg.)  Legendary French filmmaker Francois Truffaut has a nice supporting role as a French scientist who initially wants to know what Dreyfuss knows.  But he turns out benign.  This was one of the first mainstream Hollywood movies to treat extra-terrestrials sympathetically.  (Spielberg's E.T. was still five years in the future.)  And it is still one of the best ever, helped immeasurably by John Williams' ethereal score and an innate intelligence toward UFOs.  Young Guffey's final scene is particularly lovely as he waves goodbye to the departing spaceship.\n\nI still wish Spielberg had kept in the scene he replaced in the 1980's for TV where we go inside the spaceship at the end.  But my Mom thinks it is more satisfying to let us wonder what the interior is like and who is inside.  Judge Crater?  Lee Harvey Oswald?  Marilyn Monroe?  I still fondly remember \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" from PINOCCHIO playing inside, but maybe my Mom is right on Spielberg's decision.  He and longtime editor Michael Kahn (still his editor of choice) seem to have imperceptibly improved the middle of a long 137 minute movie.\n\nCLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND is magnificent filmmaking that holds up beautifully after thirty years.  Though his SCHINDLER'S LIST (1993) and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998) are mature adult works of art, Spielberg still has no equals for creating great popular movie entertainment for kids of all ages--like the INDIANA JONES trilogy.  CLOSE ENCOUNTERS is worth another look if you have not seen it in a while.\n\nI am reviewing a $10 drugstore DVD with no bonuses, but restored color, THX sound, and letterboxing for Panavision.  You might want to spend more and get the two disk set with bonuses on how the astonishing UFO's were created.","summary":"A science fiction masterpiece looks better than ever","unixReviewTime":1178150400,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

Pawl","reviewText":"Though, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND was made thirty years ago, it has a wonderful, fresh, timeless quality that keeps you intrigued and entertained.  Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), a father and husband, is forever changed upon experiencing a close encounter with beings from another planet, during a blackout, while in his truck, on his way to repair multiple electrical outages in his town.  Roy is changed, after having this experience, and it totally turns his life on its head in his process to really understand what he encountered in the darkness, that evening.  His wife, Romie (Teri Garr) and children cannot comprehend this sudden change in Roy, as he is driven to more and more unusual behavior, as the story progresses.  Roy encounters Gillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon) and her son, Barry (Cary Guffey), who also experienced a brush with this supernatural encounter.  They are brought together by their experience, and are also divided from those around them who have not witnessed the arrival of the mysterous, night-dwelling spaceships, and the bright lights that announce their arrival.\n\nCLOSE ENCOUNTERS deals with some very well-executed themes.  They include the concept of life, existing on the planets beyond our Earth and the possibility that some people really are destined to explore life beyond the constraints of the world that we know.  Also, Richard Dreyfuss' character is representative of the dreamer that exists in all of us, before the world shuts down our feelings of possibility.\n\nWhat's more, this duel disc collector's edition of the film includes bonus footage that was left out of the extended version of the film, as well as a documentary that takes a closer look at the special effects and great effots that went into bringing the story to the screen.  This is great for true film buffs and anyone for whom CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND was a religious experience.  The anecdotes are entertaining and insightful.

And there seems not a wasted frame (even in cut\/uncut\/recut DVD extras) involved in this, a strange, wonderful SCI-FI\/FANTASY film that blurs the lines joyfully between the two genres.\n\nOn one hand, CE3K is based upon just enough facts and evidence (with credibility) about the UFO\/ET phenomenom (continuing to present day) to effectively suspend disbelief in the audience, but is filled with amazing and eye candy CGI special effects to realize that vision of those crazies who have been contacted.  And those who have yet not.  Except for the original Apocalypse Now (not the crappy and detracting \"redux\"), this is almost a \"perfect film\" in every way.  Especially for \"Hollyweird.\"  Shame this had to come in the same year as the original \"Star Wars.\"  As well as other great films.\n\nRoy Neary is the everyman.  Just an ordinary American schlmoe in a small town, an electric power county repairman, who one unexpected night, called out on an emergency power blackout, is encountered on a dark, quiet, star-filled night sky, by something very strange, and beings far beyond his understanding.\n\nHis truck is \"explored\" by a brightly lit UFO, turning his vehicle suddenly anti-gravity, and sunburning one side of his face as he tried to look up at the ET craft, in a truck whose electronic systems and radio have all gone haywire and dark.\n\nEveryman Neary (Richard Dryefuss) sees a lot of other amazingly colorful and special, special effects shortly after his first encounter, but with a non-understanding wife (Teri Garr), his personal life falling apart because he just can't get over WHAT HE EXPERIENCED (despite official government denials) and becomes obsessed with it, Roy hooks up with Jillian (Melinda Dillon) who shared Neary's experiences, and whose young boy was apparently abducted by the ufo's and E.T.\n\nUnlike Spielberg's later (more successful financially but much less so artistically) \"ET: The Extraterrestrial,\" Close Encounters captures the awe and wonder at the confrontation of the unknown and frighteningly unexplored.  While in ET, most of what is presented is childlike and revealed, in CE3K (Close Encounters of the Third Kind), the genius of Spielberg is more fully realized and more rewardingly subtle.  Maybe Steve was just uncorrupted by the Hollywood system, but while I like ET, Close Encounters is presented as a mystery in the most cosmic sense.  A normal American joe encounters the extraordinary.  How will he resolve this?  And what wonders await?\n\nI have always had a problem with the various versions and releases\/edits of this film.  Even with deleted scenes and unseen ones however, there really is no \"filler\" here.  This was and is, Hollywood SCI-FI\/FANTASY filmmaking at its best, along with George Lucas and his efforts of course.\n\nI envy those who have never experienced this movie.  I've seen it (in all its forms) more than any other film (save perhaps Apocalypse Now in its two forms), and there are parts I still MUST watch, whenever it appears on the tube.  It is a movie of mystery and frustration, of identification with the characters and that sense of wonder of exploring the unknown, and while Spielberg's \"ET\" might've been a compelling exploration of that quest to understand the wonderous unknown, this movie is even more compelling.  And appeals not to the child, but to the child within all of us, so called \"adults.\"\n\n\"Even if there ain't no such thing,\" Roy Neary said.\n\nThe story is believable, the characters are all of us in a way, the special effects are spectacular, the wonder of it all is evident in almost every frame, the music is second to none, and this was, and remains Steven Spielberg's finest achievement.","summary":"Perhaps the best \"Hollywood\" film ever made...","unixReviewTime":1167091200,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

He is bafflied and awestruck by this event. He sees a huge object overhead in the sky ... It has bright blinking lights on its underside. The size is monumental as it floats off. This event changes his life forever ... He begins to draw and paint a flat-topped mountain which becomes an obsession.

A scientist interviews a poor Mexican farmer who saw the bright lights over the Mexican desert which he describes as the sun singing to him ... Roy Neary and many of his neighbors go out into the fields where the sky is the darkest and wait to see the phenomenon again.

A six-fold classification was developed in the late 1950s:\n\n(1) Nocturnal lights: bright lights seen at night.\n(2) Daylight disks: usually oval or disk-like.\n(3) Radar visual: visual sightings detected by radar.\n(4) Close encounters of the first kind: visual sightings of an UFO.\n(5) Close encounters of the second kind:  visual sightings plus physical effects on animate or inanimate objects.\n(6) ** Close encounters of the third kind: sightings of occupants in or around the UFO.\n\nThere is also another category not on this list:\n\nClose encounters of the fourth kind: actual physical contact with the occupants of UFOs is made.\n\nThe movie was written and directed by Steven Spielberg.  He explains his movie:\n\n\"I wanted to make a very accessible story about the everyday individual who has a sighting that overturns his life and throws it into complete upheaval as he starts to become more and more obsessed with his experience.\"\n\nThis movie focuses on three main characters:\n\n(1) Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss):  He is an everyday kind of guy that has a materialistic wife (Teri Garr) and three children.  He has an experience that makes him obsessed with aliens.  (This is the person Spielberg is talking about above.)\n\n(2) Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon, who earned a supporting actress nomination):  She is a single mother whose young son, Barry (Cary Guffey), was abducted by an alien spacecraft.  She thus also becomes obsessed with aliens.\n\n(3) Claude Lacombe (played by the great French moviemaker Francois Truffaut):  This character is based on a real-life UFO expert.  Lacombe is a U.N. scientist who is in-charge of a mostly American team investigating unexplained phenomenon on Earth.\n\nAll three of these characters meet and experience (with others) an extraordinary event--First Contact.\n\nNote that this movie, as can be deduced from its title, focuses on an encounter of the third kind but encounters of other kinds do occur in this movie.\n\nIn my opinion, of all the actors, Richard Dreyfuss as the obsessed Roy Neary does an excellent job.\n\nThe genius of this movie is that we don't find out until the end whether the aliens are hostile or not.\n\nThe special effects are remarkable for the time especially at the end.  Actually much of this movie does not have major special effects until its end where the fantastic effects easily stand up to those of today.  This brings up another point: this is an intelligent sci-fi movie where the special effects have a purpose and are not simply used for display.\n\nThe background music is especially good.  It garnered an Academy Award nomination.\n\nThis movie in total had eight Academy Award nominations and one win for Best Cinematography.\n\nThe only problem I had with the story is that it seems to drag a bit during its middle scenes.\n\nFinally, the DVD (collector's edition) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has a few extras, all of which are interesting.\n\nIn conclusion, if you want to see what it feels like to experience First Contact, then I strongly recommend viewing this captivating movie!!!\n\n(1977;  2 hr, 15 min;  2 discs;  widescreen;  28 scenes)\n\n+++++","summary":"Experience what it may be like to make First Contact!","unixReviewTime":1138579200,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

Crawford","reviewText":"I was utterly rivetted by this film when I saw it in '77.  It had no shoot'em up alien stuff, but instead is an extremely subtle exploration of first open contact with alien explorers.  THere is a lot of humor and mystery in it, unexplained things that come together in the end in a wonderful and optimistic climax.  I found it a powerful emotional experience then, and seeing it nearly 30years later - with my kids, who were also fully engaged in the mystery and mood of it - equally satisfying (ok, a bit slow at time for them as they are used to star wars action and pace).  Indeed, this is one of the best sci-fi films I have ever seen.\n\nBut at the heart of the story is the young Richard Dreyfus.  I think this is one of his greatest performances, which is really saying something given his qualities as an actor.  Here, he is a normal guy who becomes an extraordinary person:  while he lacks the education and experience of those who are similarly smitten with close encounters of the 3rd kind, he rises above them all in an earthy way that shows the qualities within him that no one, not even himself, knew he had.  It is really a subtle transformation,  a new kind of film experience in my view.  His crazy behavior in the beginning is revealed later as an almost spiritual journey to which he was \"invited.\"\n\nOne of the funnest thing about this film is how many things go unexplained.  That means a lot of it remains under the surface, where answers are implied but never made explicit.  Why now?  What were the aliens looking for?  Why was Dreyfus \"invited\"?  (Did they see something in him?  Were they testing similar people?  Why didn't his friend feel ready to go as well?)  If you are so inclined, these questions can ignite your imagination as the best sci-fi can.\n\nWarmly recommended.  This is a masterpiece of off-the-beaten track sci-fi.","summary":"great sci-fi, but it ages","unixReviewTime":1138147200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Mixing my two favorite genres: comedy and horror, into a nice blend, \"Idle Hands\" is a film I greatly enjoyed.  The overall mix is done quite well, blending the two genres quite well.\n\nThe plot focuses around a teenage boy named Anton Tobias.  Like any other teenager, Anton is lazy and enjoys the usual stereotypical activities such as getting high.  His two best friends are no better than he is, and together the three of them are the ultimate slacker archetype.\n\nAnton is so out of touch with the world that he does not even realize the sudden slaughtering of his parents that occurs, instead deciding to continue with his usual behavior.  It isn't until later that Anton even realizes that both of his parents have been brutally murdered and all of the fingers are suddenly pointing to him as the sole suspect of the crime.  They say that \"idle hands\" do the devil's work, but in this case it's true.  All of those years of doing nothing have come back to haunt Anton.  After inviting his two friends over, Pnub and Mick, Anton's hand suddenly brutally murders the two of them.  It appears as if his hand has a mind of its own, and the only thing on its mind is murder.\n\nHis hand begins to make him do further things that he would not normally do upon his own freewill, such as confront the girl next door that he's been crushing on for quite some time.  As it turns out, Molly (Jessica Alba) has always had the same feelings for Anton, but he had never approached her to find out.  After his hand makes him approach Molly, the two of them actually realize how they have truly felt all this time.  This turns out to be the only positive thing that his hand has brought him, but after several other hi-jinks and misfortunes, Anton decides to cut off his own hand, reminiscent of Evil Dead.  Further antics begin to occur, as Mick and Pnub return to life and assist Anton in saving Molly from the demonic hand.  With the assistance of a demon hunter, the group spends the remainder of the film battling the demonic hand in a series of laugh inducing scenes.\n\nI was not expecting much from this film, being the only reason I purchased it was to add to my collection of Jessica Alba films, but I was greatly surprised with the results.  The film is a perfect blend of horror related comedy, kind of amongst the lines of other horror-comedy films such as \"Shaun of the Dead\", \"Young Frankenstein\", \"Evil Dead\" and more recently \"Zombieland\".  Being a blend of these two genres means that one cannot take the film seriously, so do not expect award winning writing or acting, it's meant more as a parody of the horror genre.  As long as you know what to expect from this movie you will gladly enjoy a few good laughs and find yourself indulging in a highly underrated film.","summary":"Funny Movie, Underrated In My Opinion","unixReviewTime":1258588800,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

A flip-flop tray that has to be pulled out of a sleeve.\n\nThe second DVD doesn't offer much more, than the specials already included at the end of the videotape.\n\nGranted, the sound is a bit better than its VHS counterpart, but was it worth it? NO!\n\nLet me just compare it with the \"LEGEND - Special Edition\" 2-DVD release.\n\nWhat did you get in that one?\n\nFirst of all, since there were two versions of the \"LEGEND\" movie (a Europen\/International and a U.S. version), you got them both.\n\nSame feature was included in the \"ALIEN\" superbox, in which one got the theatrical releases and the special\/director's cuts, back to back and in the \"X-MEN\" superbox, in which you can easily \"reintegrate\" the cut scenes of the theatrical versions with a push on your remote control.\n\nHere you just receive Steven Spielberg's original vision and the cut\/additional scenes are left to a special by itself, included in DVD 2.\n\nThe special contents are the very same as the ones included, as said earlier, at the end of the tape.\n\nThe interview with Spielberg is tedious and disenchanting. A man consumed by too much success speaks out and seems almost bored with what seems to have been his masterpiece of all times.\n\nA man that has lost his original vision and is disenchanted with his own ideals of yesteryear is not very interesting at all. He's just old.\n\nTo impose it then to his \"fans???\" is stupid to say the least.\n\nMaybe he is tired, maybe he is just plainly being sarcastic, or so I hope, 'cause if it is what the man truly feels about producing and directing his own movies (and having an extreme amount of luck in being able to do so at all, while many never get a chance in their lifetimes), seems like a slap in the face to those who have admired his work and his talent.\n\nI, having watched the interview felt personally offended by his reviewed vision of things. Maybe I lack the \"maturity???\" he has achieved?\n\nNevertheless, I bought this, let me say, junk of a movie.\n\nI even attributed it 3 stars in memory of the old glory it represented, when I first went to a movie theatre to watch it.\n\nIt hasn't improved one bit, being transferred onto DVD.\n\nIt just sits there, in my shelf, gathering dust.\n\nI wanted to buy \"E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial\" Special Edition, but having seen this, I suspect it's the same-o, same-o as the Laser Disc version I already have and the special VHS widescreen tape I bought some years ago.\n\nNor am I enthused to have, as a special, the score conducted live by John Williams either. I'll rather wait until the \"live\" score will appear on audio CD one day, and then again, the question will still remain, will I still be interested in anything Steven Spielberg did?\n\nAs said, the decision to include such a disillusioned interview with Spielberg on a movie I have learned to cherish for years, made me think, and when I think, it is not usually a good thing.\n\nI sometimes wonder whether this movie was made out of passion or plain and simply with a taste for money in mind.\n\nThese are things that irritate me immensely. It is as if Shakespeare would have put down all the works he had written and had considered them plain \"youth junk\".\n\nSorry Mr. Spielberg, a man that loses faith in his own visions, after having founded a family or not, has either been badly burned by life (which doesn't really seem to be the case with you), or he is plainly tired of his life as it is, in which case my honest suggestion would be, to change activity altogether and allow somebody else ready to carry your burden to emerge.\n\nI have always detested winers, especially when they have reached the top and had so much luck with it.\n\nPlease take a moment and think about it, Mr. Spielberg.\n\nWho made you what you are?\n\nThe Studios? The Executives? The Backers?\n\nOr we, the audience?\n\nThink, and think hard!\n\nSorry, I cannot recommend this product and unless somebody with more inventiveness and loyalty toward the audience will dish up both versions (in their entirety), with more uplifting and more interesting specials, I don't see why anyone would do himself so much harm as to waste his\/her money in a clever \"rehash\" of the very same product.\n\nBy the way, since I am already at it. Please studios, distributors, directors and producers, do us all a big, immense favor.\n\nStop reissuing the same products in a dozen of different packagings, when the product itself is always the same.\n\nIt's a waste of time, talent, taste, money and a complete lack of true intelligence, creativity and intuitiveness.\n\nI can only suppose that you are all better than that, so why don't you push yourselves harder to finally give us, the audience, better and more thoroughly thought of products?\n\nYou only stand to gain from it.\n\nJust remember what Abraham Lincoln said:\n\n\"You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.\"\n\nA bit of respect to those who buy your products should be in order.\n\nDo not ever dare assume that the masses are only formed by illiterate and uncouth people.\n\nUnfortunately for you, there are also people out there able to scrutinize and judge you by your deeds.\n\nThere are even some, able to read between the lines.\n\nSo, please, become a bit wiser and show us that we are not just buyers, but rather chosers of your fate.\n\nYes, because ultimately it is us, the customers, who decide whether you have another day in business or not, not your fancy peers, nor your elegant, Armani clad, shareholders.\n\nKeep that in mind, and you will be in business forever.\n\nForget it, and your life may be drastically changed by the twists of fate, and as we all know, fate cannot be influenced by one man alone.\n\nThis is it.\n\nBuy it, my fellow customers, if you feel you have money to throw to the dogs. Refrain, if every penny is dear to you.\n\nThere are far better movies around.\n\nThis is just an old myth and getting older by the minute.","summary":"Disappointed with the gimmicks...","unixReviewTime":1127692800,"vote":7.0,"image":null}

When it comes down to my top 5 favorite films ever, this tends to interchange with E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial. Whereas that film is still touching and more emotional, Close Encounters is filled with a visual splendor where the images are made to show us the wonder of things that can happen. Despite Spielberg's claim that it's the one film that \"dates\" him, it's still arguably one of his best, even in light of Schindler's List or Jaws.\n\nRoy Neery is a blue-collar family man who, while on the job, has a strange encounter with a craft with bright lights in the sky. The experience ends up changing him and pretty soon he becomes obsessed with it and one particular image which causes much trouble with his wife and kids. Elsewhere, a frenchman named Mr. Lacombe and his interpreter Laughlin are finding strange things around the world such as planes and ships in the desert and a curious 5 note melody. All of this ends up tying together in the end as everyone discovers something life changing.\n\nIn the days of Jaws and Raiders of the Lost Ark, one thing that was never lost on Spielberg was making even mundane scenes interesting. From radio traffic controllers encountering something strange to Lacombe showing the famous hand signals matching the musical notes, nothing in this film seems wasted. Which of course makes the completely memorable images all the more striking such as Roy's truck going haywire, mother Jillian getting unwelcome visitors in her house to seeing just how massive the final ship is compared to the mountain, this film never feels like it just lags.\n\nOne of the great things about Spielberg is that he actually explains why he shoots a scene a certain way or how he came up with a particular shot. Most directors go \"well...thought it would be cool\" but as he says in the excellent documentary on the making of the film; sure the mothership coming up from behind the mountain instead of the sky doesn't make any sense but it's an awesome image so who cares if it's not realistic. Included with the set is deleted scenes that didn't make the cut including the fate of the police officer who chased, (and flew over a ditch), one of the UFO's as well as the interior of the mothership with Spielberg being right saying it should've been a mystery.\n\nIs it as exciting and popcorn fun as Jaws? Or as serious and character driven as Schindler's List? Well no but that's beside the point since this is a film where you're almost glad something that feels this against the grain exists.","summary":"Probably in my top 5 favorite films ever","unixReviewTime":1121817600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Believe me, if this was you, you would have sleepless nights. Dialogue is good, FX, is incredible for 1977, and the soundtrack is FANTASTIC. Spielberg's 3rd feature film is a breakthrough, and one mans drive and vision of his childhood dreams.

I looked forward to seeing it, but unfortunately it did not measure up. After hearing mixed reviews (so many of them referred to it as 'boring'), I was prepared to give it a go.\n\nClose Encounters is very slow moving, with the occassional interesting thing occurring, but it is not until the end where something interesting happens.  And even then, I expected more.  I was left thinking \"is that it, after all that slow build-up?\".  Many scenes during the film are just too stupid for words.\n\nI have viewed the 2-Disc collector's edition which apparently is a combination of the Director's Cut and the original theatrical version. For a first timer to the film, it made no difference to me. However, as fans of the film have stated, the tampering by Spielberg for this special edition was not appreciated.  He re-edited the original version removing scenes that perhaps gave it its popularity (eg. Dreyfuss entering the mothership).  Spielberg has said he will never re-instate these scenes. Doesn't it annoy you when a Director refuses to let people see a film the way they originally remember?  It's almost a kick in the teeth for helping him make his millions.  Oh well, at least he had the decency to allow the original 'untouched' version of E.T. to be included on the 2002 digitally enhanced version DVD.\n\nThe second disc of CE3K contains the extras which I guess would be gold for fans of the film. The DVD overall is a limited edition and at a price too - I am surprised at the price considering the film isn't that great.

One night, he gets an emergency call from his work. Being an electrical lineman, he has to go out. He drives to a rural area near Muncie, Indiana and stops at a railroad crossing.  This moment is about to change him.  He continues to have visions of something, but he does not know what it is yet.\n  In Muncie, Indiana, there is a mother, Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon) who raises her 3-year old young son, Barry (Cary Guffey).  There is some kind of storm brewing over. The boy wakes up and suddenly the toys come on and the vacuum runs around. The kitchen is a mess. The boy runs outside laughing and playing. Jillian runs after him and climbs up a roadside.

It also included the song, \"When You Wish Upon A Star\" in end credits.\n  For the ABC Network version in the 1980's, another version of the film was made.

Yes, SCREAM did it too, but for some reason, the way IDLE HANDS shows us a guy that loves the girl next door and has two dumb buddies like every bad teen movie ever makes the fact that the movie is about a stoner that kills his parents and best friends (who come back as freaking zombies) with his possessed right hand (hi, Ash) so much sweeter. Yes, maybe I'm reading too much into it, but this movie really is underrated in my opinion. It has great music (especially The Offspring's version of The Ramones' I WANNA BE SEDATED), a clever script, great performances (especially by Seth Green & Elden Henson as the zombified buddies Mick and Pnub, who didn't walk up the stairway to Heaven because \"it was too far\"), and sly direction by Rodman Flender, who has done TALES FROM THE CRYPT episodes, which at times this movie shares its tone with. Overall, IDLE HANDS is great for horror fans that like their horror with a wink and a nod, and it even throws in some unnecessary nudity, just like the good ol' days.","summary":"Be careful, man, some of 'em are guys","unixReviewTime":1175299200,"vote":null,"image":null}

If you've seen any recent horror flicks within the past 10 years(Taking Lives, Wrong Turn, I Still Know What you Did Last Summer, Scream), then you know it's filled with the dummest imaginable good guys, cheesy plot and almost un-killable bad guys. And scenes that are supposed to thrill you and you just wonder when this is going to end. I almost fell asleep in a few of those movies, that's how lame, tiring and boring they are. Fortunately, for this film, it has Jessica Alba and Seth Green, who are two fantastic actors\/actresses and are always delightful to see. Seth Green is hilarious as the main characters buddy, and Jessica Alba is more then sexy. However, the movie is beyond cheesy(like a hand jumping out a microwave through the window, smashing the glass in the mean time and landing in the bush, but it can't escape the microwave. Or, when the lady(played by Vivica A. Fox(Kill Bill)) is hit by a car, which is backing up, and then is sent 50 feet. Uh huh, that's realistic. Ends sarcasm.) Then there is tones of un-necessary gore and silly scenes like the guy losing his head. And how exactly did his buddies get back? They don't explain anything and assume everything is magical. It delivers the comedy pretty well, thanks to Seth Green for that, but is just too silly, far too cheesy and extremely lame(a hand that is possessed?

He's out of milk. He's out of dog food. He has no girl, no car, no central motivating ambition. He's a total loser.\n\nWorst of all, he's \"dry\": totally out of fuel for the bong. Forced to face the bleak prospect of a cheerless world not percolating to the hazy slacker cumulus of marijuana. Oh, and there's a brutal serial killer loose on the streets: a maniac who slaughters his victims, skins them alive, and---when the need arises---takes eyeballs and other chunky bits as souvenirs.\n\nLife can be a real b*tch when you haven't yet turned 18.\n\nAnyway, things quickly get rough, brutal, bloody, and totally out of hand (heh). Questions mount right along with the body count: Where are Anton's parents? Who is slaughtering his friends and neighbors? Is it wise to try score weed off a cop, even if y'all went to the same high school? Will Anton ever really muster up enough courage to ask the hottie of his dreams (the truly luscious Jessica Alba) to the prom? And it is possible---perhaps probable?---that his suddenly wanderlusting hand might have something to do with the wanton bloodletting and recent reign of terror?\n\n\"Idle Hands\" is perfectly adorable on all counts and entertains scandalously: don't be alarmed by the 90210-ish packaging or the blurbs that make this thing out to be an innocent romantic comedy.\n\nI was nearly scared away by all the chick-friendly marketing, but I persisted---and happily, I found this little romp in the cemetery to be sick, twisted, and totally freakish. Seth Green (Anton's slacker buddy Mick) gets to spend some up-close-and-personal cranial quality time with a beer bottle (local brew). Buddy Pnub (the hysterical and eminently blase Eldon Henson) loses his head and sees his social life improve---albeit with a little duct tape and a garden trowel. Dexter (lead singer of Offspring, who does a killer cover of the Ramones \"I wanna be Sedated\") gets scalped by an evil possessed right hand (played, admirably and with great dramatic restraint, by Christopher Hart, who plays hands and nothing else. I'm not kidding).\n\n\"Idle Hands\", turned out by director Rodman Flender and a talented SWAT team of special effects mavericks, is simply all kinds of cool.\n\nI mean, come on: you have Ramones cover songs. You have Hands Baked Alaska in the microwave. You have adorable little kitty cats nibbling away at eyeballs and licking up spilled blood. You have one of the uber-coollest opening sequences (\"I'm Under the Bed\"---oh BOO-ya!) in horror movie history, in which veteran character actor Fred Willard plays Dad. You have Vivica Fox brandishing a meat-cleaver and screaming \"die, Host of Evil!\". You get \"Dawn of the Dead\" and \"Evil Dead\" tributes---who am I kidding, \"Idle Hands\" is itself one long Evil Dead tribute. You get slacker friends consigned to walk the Earth forever as the soulless Living Dead---all because they hated the white light, the Enya Music, and the general sense that Heaven meant having to \"walk to far\".\n\nAnyway, the horrific, ugly, malign, diabolic evil slaughtering hand is one of the staples of Grand Guignol horror, and Flender and Company hit the ball out of the park and work their material like champs. Hell ain't so bad if you have good (undead) friends and plenty of Cheesey-Poofs---give the boy a Hand.\n\nJSG","summary":"One Toke over the Line","unixReviewTime":1104537600,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

Frederick","reviewText":"Well, me for one. The main character of this movie, for another. But for some reason, not the main character's wife and kids.\n\nSome people see this movie as the escape of the main character from the drudgery of life on earth. But I think they have missed the film completely.\n\nOf the three versions of the film, I prefer the original. To explain why, let me begin simply by offering some snippets from the different edits, without explanation: In the original version, we are given a very meaningful cut going from a young child running after UFO's under the night sky, to the main character's music box playing, 'when you wish upon a star' from the Disney version of Pinocchio (instead of going to the main character's own kid bugging him about doing his homework for him, as in the later editions); in the original version we are given a meaningful cut going from the main character trying to explain what he saw to his wife, to his wife hiding newspaper clippings from her husband dealing with the same topic (instead of going to an old lost cargo ship somehow recently left in the desert of Mongolia, as in the later editions); in the original version we are given a seamless transition going from a team of scientists learning about a set of musical notes in India, to an attempt to translate them into hand signals, to an attempt to use them to contact the aliens by transmitting them by radio--to a young child successfully using the same notes on a toy xylophone.\n\nThe theme of this movie is about seeing the ordinary as extraordinary. It might also be called: \"Man, Machine and the Northern lights.\" Or even, \"Pinocchio for Physics Majors.\" Though \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" suits it well enough. First kind: sighting. Second kind: physical evidence. Third kind: contact. These terms were coined by Hynek to categorize reports of UFO's. Spielberg applies them in a way more down to earth. The ordinary things seen as extraordinary: technology, seen as part of nature, like the northern lights; human beings and relationships, seen as remarkable and unusual as alien encounters--or as wooden puppets become real boys. The hero portrays an ordinary man who is childlike and single hearted. In terms of categorization, the movie might best be characterized as a visual-musical fantasy, though strictly speaking it is of course science fiction. It is quite ingeniously directed and very beautifully choreographed. Superficially, it is about alien contact, but at a deeper level, it is a beautiful depiction of the limits (and limited validity) of a mechanical approach to life. In the end, it's more about human contact, than about alien contact.\n\nThe film consists of several sub-plots which gradually dovetail together. At the summit: The hero, Roy Neary, and a young boy, Barry Guiler, having kindred spirits, are, so to speak--through many trials and despite themselves--eventually brought together as family, one might even say providentially so. This family is contrasted to some vivid scenes of domestic life lived in narrow and petty way; the new family feels at home with itself while welcoming the most distant strangers: visitors from the stars. This openness is conveyed on the level of a child who is too innocent to even know the difference between an alien and a human; I would say, precisely, that it was Spielberg's main accomplishment in this film to convey it. Here Barry, a toddler, even steals the show--reportedly nicknamed by Spielberg as the \"one take\" kid! Though outwardly a movie about aliens, the visitors ultimately have, in this sense, the simple role of introducing the boy--and his widowed mom, Jillian--to the man (and very much from the point of view of the kid). It is, as it were, the antithesis of the premise for \"Lost in Space,\" of a family huddled together in an alien and hostile universe. If the child in you is dead, don't waste your time watching this film. If the adult in you is alive, be willing to see the film multiple times. It hangs together very well, but it takes multiple viewings to fully appreciate it and see why.\n\nPerhaps it even takes the multiple re-cuts. This film made a big impact on me when I first saw the original version; watching the re-cuts and analyzing why it had such an impact for me did go hand in hand. It is very interesting to now see side-by-side the three different versions of this film which Spielberg came out with reworking it over the years; I'm happy to have the three provided together in this anniversary DVD. The line from the film which I made into the title of this review--spoken by one of Neary's sons--was actually not in the original cut. But it summarizes the original just as well as it does the other two versions (the \"special edition\" and the subsequent, \"director's cut\"), nonetheless. Spielberg followed his gut in this film, but he didn't check his brain at the door. Both have served him well. I see the original edition as the definitive one, and the two re-cuts as commentary and footnotes. Spielberg has referred to the director's cut as penultimate. I do not exclude the possibility of a new, ultimate version. Spielberg says that the original version suffered by being rushed due to studio pressures, and that the special edition was compromised by studio politics which required a \"peek inside the mothership.\" The director's cut, it seems to me (and others), was compromised by being made-for-tv.  The original or theatrical version won an Oscar for cinematography.  The second two editions do provide insight (and unused footage) into Spielberg's original vision; but I think the original cut still remains the best overall version to date.\n\nTwo fascinating, very effective and related themes of the film are seeing the world as new, as if for the first time, and persevering aspirations to be faithful to truth amid being called into question by more conventional points of reference. Neary is led at points even to question his sanity himself; the audience is given enough reasons to question his sanity too (or at least fear for his losing it), though are also provided with enough clues to leave open a positive final verdict.  On the one hand, for example, Roy is not concerned merely with UFO sight-seeing (even with his family)--he speaks in a number of places where he sees an importance to what he saw and the sharing of it with authorities--; on the other hand, when team of Lacombe (an international professional UFO investigator) first learns of the coordinates of the mountain where the aliens are planning a major visit, they wind up needlessly trashing some furniture (an expensive globe belonging to the county supervisor)--in other words, just what bad decisions will normal people make under extraordinary circumstances? The scenes where Neary inadvertently acts crazy in front of the neighbors--to gather material for building a large scale model mountain in his living room--were taken out from the special edition and restored in the director's cut; perhaps Spielberg worried the scenes put too much of the blame for the marriage breakup on Neary (and no, it's not like Neary has no flaws).  In the special edition, in fact, Ronnie leaves the house before we see anything of the large scale mountain; we only see Neary carrying a garden hose and his youngest son protesting being taken by his mom into the car saying that 'dad needs some more help'--with the car then proceeding to nearly run Neary over--; the version underscores: Ronnie deserted Neary.  (Though a relevant line of Ronnie's is only found in the original version, where she flatly states, 'I am not getting a job,' just minutes after getting the news Roy lost his job with the power company, a fact for which she was partly to blame as she was careless and nonchalant in passing on some urgent phones messages, including from the governor.)  Neary first noticed the real mountain on TV (after building--and regretting having made--the large scale model), in a news story covering a concocted \"nerve gas\" scare, which he saw just seconds after his wife abruptly hung up him (amid a sincere effort on his part to reconcile).  Alot to take in, a bit of a roller coaster, even for the audience.  Was Neary alone to blame for his marital problems, or did the failure to communicate (with Ronnie early on even literally plugging her ears), give him too much for him to deal with at once?  Roy was actually fired in the wake of his having been sent (also underscored only in the original version) to investigate the cause of a power failure--which he found--it was UFOs.  Did Neary, nevertheless, then abandon his kids and fail to provide for them, or did he, at least from the point of his wife hanging up on him, only pursue the best--or even the only way--to make good, provide a fuller appreciation of what is real, even secure visitation rights (against accusations of insanity)?  (It is sometimes said that good stories don't tell us what to think, rather, they simply give us things to think about.)  In any event, what Neary sacrifices to build the models, unexpectedly losing his family in the process, becomes very meaningful when he draws on this experience to climb the real thing--expressly going against a government cover-up story which evacuated the area to keep lay spectators away. Very intense scene, like a double jeopardy--and he is still not sure what he is going to find (nor is the audience). Beautifully shot. The last half hour of the film deserves its reputation, but the rest of the film is far from filler; it does, however, set the stage.  I do think the mountain-climbing scene is helped by showing the prior havoc involved in building the large scale model mountain; I think Spielberg was right to restore it to the director's cut.  Neary's recklessness in building the mountain was over the top, but his enthusiasm seemed to stem from being convinced that he was finally going to be able to share what he experienced with his family, though he was tragically mistaken.\n\nRoy is vindicated at the end of the film in his conviction of the importance of his sighting--an importance which ultimately boils down, it seems to me, as the needed supplement for the limitations in a mechanical approach to communication. The limitations here are very beautifully portrayed in the final sequences by a \"musical\" conversation with the aliens, based on a five-tone sequence which humans first heard coming from the UFOs in India. Anticipating the importance of making the most of this for future communication, Lacombe makes use of a system for teaching music to the deaf to associate hand signals with the notes, which he teaches to the members of his team on the fly (in a nearly empty university auditorium). The notes were successfully imitated by radio to get in response (through radio telescopes) the coordinates of the mountain; they were also successfully used to initiate a whole musical conversation at the mountain itself (with a man at a keyboard and the mothership responding). But the hand signals were very nearly a case of being dressed up with no place to go. Computers were analyzing said musical conversation as it took place, searching for mathematical patterns (I imagine against a database), which the humans were doing their best to go along with, not by improvising, but by music theory. The computer found a pattern, took over the conversation, but it turned out to be incomplete. The computer could no longer respond to the mothership's prompts. The people were stumped too. (I don't fault Spielberg here for not telling us the formula the computer matched against the music, and why it sounded like music. Ever listen to mathematically generated fractal music? Some of it isn't bad, actually.) The point here was plainly that it was time for face to face contact. Lacombe was ready with his hand signals, but the aliens weren't too interested in them. They come out of the ship just romping and playing; they were looking for Roy. (An alien eventually does use the signals to wave goodbye--or was it hello \/ see you later?--to Lacombe, who had before waved his arms in exasperation when the aliens delayed responding to the musical tones.) To me explicitly having the theme of body language in the film made perfect sense. While you can't paint a real smile, you can study the difference between a real one and a posed one: they actually involve different facial muscles, even different neurological pathways. Neary's participation was necessarily spontaneous, and Lacombe was wise enough to understand its importance even from a more mechanical perspective: In its scientific defense, he refers to it as a \"sociological event.\" To put it another way: Lacombe was \"left-brained,\" Neary was \"right-brained,\" and the two approaches come together in the end to make a fully-blown encounter of the \"third kind\" with aliens who are \"whole brained.\"\n\nNeary and Barry do have the common failing of not being notably articulate. Neary even once quotes Barry in trying to describe the UFOs as \"like an ice-cream cone\"--adding only that its flavor was \"orange\" (and this being an improvement over his first attempt: \"there was a red whoosh...\"). He does improve considerably in comparing them to the aurora borealis, the northern lights--but only mispronouncing \"borealis.\" Jillian, more sensitive to the interpersonal side of things, does a better job too--and betraying herself a kindred spirit--when she spontaneously calls the visits in the sky \"Halloween for grownups.\" Eventually standing at the end of a line of volunteer astronauts arranged by Lacombe (and the only one not carrying a large duffle-bag), Neary is singled out and playfully caressed by the playmate friends which Barry had already made, solidifying, confirming and celebrating the new family bonds (the most moving moment of the film, with music from Neary's favorite movie, Pinocchio, playing spaced-style ala John Williams). On the whole a remarkable accomplishment, and a Spielberg masterpiece (both written and directed by him). Taking nothing away from \"alien contact,\" it still in its own way trumps it with a \"family reunion.\" This theme was to recur in E.T., but there alien contact becomes tongue-in-cheek and all-too-familiar; one might even say that E.T. is \"CE3K for dummies.\" Barry was no less interesting or precious than any alien; at one scene it is even made obvious that he looks a bit like his alien friends. The deep, personal contact of the kindred souls, even if visceral and inarticulate, is the real \"encounter.\" It was this simultaneous solidifying of earthly and extraterrestrial bonds which was really the most striking thing about the film. After welcoming Neary, and just after \"waving\" to Lacombe, the alien takes a moment to gaze upon the human crowd with such an expression of wonder and amazement, it is breathtaking; another inspiring, moving and thoughtful scene--as if Spielberg were holding up a mirror to the human race. When Neary was caressed by Barry's playmates, they visibly did so with a sense of awe and amazement, a moment which moved Jillian to tears as she witnessed it herself; in a sense she sees Neary through the aliens' eyes. Yet why shouldn't aliens act that way? Why suppose that these imaginary beings of the story are more jaded than Barry, Jillian or Neary? Neary's virtue might be summarized by the simple fact that (as expressed in his own words, while once commenting on the UFOs), he 'didn't want to see this;' he was just someone open to truth and faithful to whatever he saw. He wanted to see Pinocchio with his kids. Are such attitudes really so unbelievable or trivial, or are they neither?\n\n\"To the child the tree and the lamp post are as natural and as artificial as each other; or rather, neither of them are natural but both supernatural, for both are splendid and unexplained. The flower with which God crowns the one, and the flame with which Sam the lamplighter crowns the other, are equally of the gold of Fairy Tales[...]In the middle of the wildest fields the most rustic child is, ten to one, playing at steam engines. And the only spiritual or philosophical objection to steam engines is not that men pay for them or work at them or make them very ugly or even that men are killed by them, but merely that men do not play at them[...]The evil is that the childish poetry of clockwork does not remain[...]The wrong is not that engines are too much admired, but that they are not admired enough[...]The sin is not that engines are mechanical, but that men are mechanical.\" -G. K. Chesterton\n\nCE3K is this passage put to film.\n\n***\n***\n***\nSome digressions with tidbits and trivia:\n\nUnfortunately the digital transfer (both for DVD and for Blu-ray) was not entirely successful.  Excessive graininess in some of the scenes and particularly disappointing is some blurriness \/ halos around the special effects (all three problems for the landing of the mothership).  The UFOs in the original film actually enjoyed some degree of 'photo-realism;' they did *not* just appear as 'moving neon lights,' each a 'red whoosh' with no visible object (i.e., nothing reflecting ambient light), though too often in the transfer they appear to be just that.  Having viewed the DVD shortly after seeing the original again as it made a one-time showing in a local theater (not too many years back), which was still using standard film projectors, and I immediately noticed the difference.  Comparing CE3K's preservation, to the restored version of the original Star Wars, is just plain sad.  (I've heard rumors that Trumbull actually filmed the original effects for CE3K in 65mm; in any event, to my eye, the digital transfer is noticeably poorer than the 35mm.)  Perhaps it can be said that even Chaplin film restorations have now enjoyed better final results; it can be hoped that one day CE3K will enjoy a better transfer.\n\nThere is a very awkward cut in the special edition (and in the director's cut) dealing with the Neary family, where Ronnie is first sitting with some of Roy's junk in her hands--and then, just moments later, when it cuts back to her--we see her holding her daughter instead. In the original edition, the scene of Ronnie holding her daughter is the first time we see her.  Teri Garr did a great job as Ronnie, though in my opinion she gave a more nuanced and moving performance in, 'The Black Stallion.'\n\nI could never understand why the trucks secretly hauling scientific equipment are disguised as Piggly Wiggly and Baskin Robbins trucks. At that point they were still trying to figure out what cover story to get people out of the area with; maybe they were thinking of scaring them away with high cholesterol foods? I also find it hard to understand why there is a scene showing the volunteer astronauts wearing the special red suits as they go into a chartered bus. When sitting in what looks like a university auditorium, learning the hand signals, they are not wearing the red suits, but are singled out by having \"special\" seats off to the side. So why do they need the suits going into the bus in order to be visually singled out for the audience? The scene where the team members damage the expensive globe is a bit jolting, and seems a bit silly at first; but I can imagine they were planning to bring it back from the get go not realizing how big it was until they got to the county supervisor's office where it was kept, and so, instead of going back to get the coordinates and paper, they stuck to the original idea of just bringing back the globe for everyone to see, and thus infamously dropped it to the floor and rolled it to their destination.  True enough, when people wing it, stuff happens.\n\nI can only say that the Wyoming tower (known by Native American cultures as 'Bear Lodge' and a traditional place for religious retreat), for the final scenes, was an inspired choice by Spielberg.  Situated in a lush prairie and part of the Black Hills, it is evidently the only volcanic structure in the North American plains (protruding through layers of exposed sedimentary rocks dating back to the Triassic age) and effectively symbolizes as well as gives a visceral sense of something which reaches deep into the earth.  Spielberg has said he wanted to underscore the earthly location of the story; he succeeded beautifully.  Add to that even its 'western name' mentioned in the film--insofar as it only underscores a tower which goes down instead of up--or rather, given that the mothership arrives upside down before turning right side up to land: poetry in motion.  The earthly witnesses of the mothership, looking up, are thus shown looking 'down' onto city skyscrapers made by aliens who, wherever they are from, have long looked towards the earth simply when looking up towards their sky.  (Of course, we need not appeal to extraterrestrials, to accommodate these differences in perspective.)  Add to that the fact that it is a national monument which most people, including most Americans, have never seen: impeccable.\n\nIt was real life nephew of Richard Dreyfuss, who plays Neary's younger son Toby (perhaps that is why he had a easier time than his elder brother, Brad, to take in stride Neary's apparent nervous breakdown).\n\nWhen the movie was first released Watergate scandal \/ conspiracy was fresh off the press.  Spielberg has said he included a government cover up, to add a sense of realism, even if it is a sort of bluff: how does the audience know that these things of the movie, as well, aren't, 'actually going on right now,' just not the news?  Then again, while CE3K begins, it does not end, in a familiar mock docudrama format (also known to audiences at the time from 'documentaries' on Big Foot and the Loch Ness Monster); there is even a character in CE3K who, as a believer in both, compares Big Foot to UFOs in the same breath at a press conference, to Neary's humiliation.  If the film is dated (of course it is in incidental things, like the Nearys' home furnishing, e.g., the color portable boob tube, complete with a dial to change channels, the aviator style glasses so many are wearing, along with the obvious absence in the storyline of GPS and cell phone cameras) I don't think it can be dated in this way.  The film's realism, to its credit, only cuts both ways.  The conspiracy aspect of the film is actually quite limited; the film really only presents it as Major Walsh's idea, for the sake of evacuating people, to secure the area.  Neary is its chief, largely unintentional, victim.  Neary at one point says, 'the army is getting us out of here because they don't want any witnesses.'  They?  Meaning Lacombe?  Neary doesn't say who 'they' is because Neary doesn't (yet) know who they is.  Lacombe, was arguing with Walsh, at that very moment.\n\nThe UFO experts themselves in the movie didn't know what to expect to happen at the site any more than did Neary.  Perhaps they knew less; the movie depicts some commercial airline pilots as seeing what Neary and Jillian saw early on, but the pilots decided not to report it (perhaps so as to not risk being labeled nuts and losing their jobs).  The cover up, fittingly, is not presented as invented for the sake of permanently deceiving the world--or involving the UN, the Man from UNCLE, or even the entire US government--and it was not Lacombe's idea at all.  An American UFO expert, who also comments near the end that 'Einstein was right' (a colleague jokingly responding that 'Einstein was probably one of them,' i.e., among those who took a ride on the mothership, thus having had personal experience confirming his prediction of time dilation), was the top official at the press conference, where he told spectators along with Neary, 'I don't know what you saw.'  He obviously knew more than other officials present at the conference yet there is also no reason to believe he was not sincere in his comments.  He was presented simply as discrete, diplomatic, scientifically skeptical; not as conspiratorial.  Perhaps this *could* date the film if: (1) it cannot be fully appreciated if enjoyed as science fiction and\/or (2) it's narrative tacitly relies upon audiences, if only by drawing upon Orwell, to imagine many extra layers of 'cover up' and\/or (3) historians of science have determined that the direct experimental confirmation of time dilation for space travel had come way before GPS.  No way did the mothership pass unnoticed; Major Walsh simply did *not* evacuate a big enough area.\n\nWalter Cronkite, though mentioned by name, was not the newscaster making the cameo in the movie.  It was, however, the also prominent real life newscaster Howard K. Smith.  There is no suggestion he is to be taken in the story (let alone in reality) as part of any conspiracy; presumably the character was just reporting what Major Walsh and his team told him regarding a relatively mundane story about a train accident.\n\nPersonally, I was never much into UFOs, a fact which never detracted from my enjoyment of the movie in the least.  The film did spark my interest enough to actually read (Prof. J. Allen) Hynek's book (i.e., by a prominent, long time astrophysicist, at Northwestern University); yet my conclusion, precisely from reading it, was that there is nothing to it.  What I have read since (notably, regarding the 'anthropic principle' in cosmology, as discussed for example in a book coauthored by astronomer John Barrow and physicist Frank Tipler), has led me to the conclusion that the scientific consensus regarding intelligent life elsewhere (even insofar as it takes into account the Drake equation, just not all the principles invoked by Star Trek), is that, in point of fact, the odds are astronomically against it. The intuitive argument that the universe is so big that it must, rather, be likely, evidently doesn't hold up, as when taking into account the age and size of the universe and the complexity of DNA, the numbers just don't crunch that way.  Then again, by the same token, the odds of us being here would also be astronomically against it, so I won't belabor the point; in any event, here we are.\n\nCE3K was one of the original 'box office blockbusters;' following Jaws, Spielberg, 'did it again;' in other words *alot* of people liked it. This is the only dimension of added 'realism' that has ever meant anything to me; Hynek cameo included, I have never met anyone who thought it was a documentary.  Looking for evidence of friendly and intelligent life in the universe?  A Lily Tomlin joke aside, look no further; even if the 1950s left you wondering, they are actually making movies now, they are even sitting in theaters, right next to you.\n\nSpielberg has referred to his making of the film as a sort of catharsis.  I can understand that.\n\nThe grand finale begins immediately after Neary and Jillian show up.  The first few scout ships, pass right by them, before going to the landing area and then signaling to the other ships.  The film therefore does pose the question whether the final encounter (especially of the third kind) would have taken place at all if none of those 'invited' had actually arrived.  Perhaps the aliens would have suspected something was wrong or that humanity just wasn't ready.\n\nCE3K has not enjoyed a sequel.  That's fine; leaves it to the imagination, a bit like the ending of, 'The Life of Pi.'  After learning what Neary went through, does the future activity of the aliens include arranging a special visit with Neary's kids?  Does Neary reconcile with Ronnie?  Does he marry Jillian? What happens to Major Walsh?  It makes no sense for the mothership simply to take Neary away and never return.\n\nThe inserted scene in the special edition, which depicts the Cotopaxi as found in the Gobi desert (the 1920s cargo ship thought lost in the Bermuda triangle), in my view has the failing of overextending the mock docudrama format (as well as interfering with the lyrical timing) of the original version.  Though it was nicely filmed, I also have no idea why the helicopters are flying fast so close to the sand dunes, following their contour.\n\nI wouldn't touch the scene where the mothership, when seen for the first time, seems to rise over the mountain rather than descend from space; it is a very powerful visual symbolizing being both \"on earth and among the stars\"--and is just ambiguous enough to allow for the mothership merely \"appearing\" to rise while in fact traveling horizontally (relative to the ground at the tower)--an appearance perhaps due to the size of the ship and\/or the curvature of the earth--it leaves the audience wondering a bit just what is going on--kind of like watching a moonrise. However, on very close scrutiny, it seems there were some minor flaws in the special effects concerning the mothership (perhaps due to a rushed editing job, which Spielberg admits): In certain scenes the mothership does not appear quite as big as other scenes require. Basically, in the shot of the rising\/landing mothership, it should appear about 4x or even 8x (at least 2x) as large if it is to be the \"city in space\" (though even at 1\/2 x it would still be too big to escape the notice of Howard K. Smith) which the more close-up shots of the mothership (both outside the ship, as given by all versions, and inside, as given by the special edition) require. (I suspect a similar scene in 'Independence Day' was closer to what Spielberg was technically going for.) Still, the visuals are remarkably effective and quite beautiful, and give a very memorable impression.\n\nI've given alot of analysis, but I don't think I've spoiled anything.  Chesterton echoes Einstein:\n\n\"The fairest thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion which stands at the cradle of true art and true science. He who knows it not and can no longer wonder, no longer feel amazement, is as good as dead, a snuffed-out candle.\" (Albert Einstein)\n\nWatch the original version first, and enjoy.","summary":"'aw, who wants to go to see some dumb cartoon rated G for kids'","unixReviewTime":1100822400,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

It is not clear from the start whether to view the visitors as a malevolent or friendly force.  The film introduces us to Roy Neary(Richard Dreyfus) who encounters an alien craft while repairing some downed power lines.  From that moment on he is obsessed with this encounter despite the toll it is taking on his family and his marriage.  We also meet Gillian (Melinda Dillon), a young divorcee whose toddler son has been abducted by the aliens.  The two join forces in attempting to locate these beings despite interference by a seemingly hearltless government beauracracy(\"E.T.\" again).  They eventually locate the mothership in Wyoming where there is a major multi-national effort to communicate with the mothership.  The scene in which the technicians use musical notes to communicate with the alien craft is classic.  Not to give anything away, when we do finally see the aliens and the inside of the mothership it is something of a letdown.  I like this film immensely, though I wouldn't exactly call it a great film in the legacy of Spielberg.  It's a nice thrill-ride of a movie and you have to put in perspective that this film came at the beginning of Spielberg's career before he evolved into possibly our greatest director.","summary":"When You Wish Upon A Star....","unixReviewTime":1097193600,"vote":null,"image":null}

But oh how I loved the finale, a special effects-choked extravaganza which became one of the most famous scenes in cinema history. The film's seemingly endless buildup had some kind of payoff, and director Steven Spielberg's career was set for life (well, he did follow this film with \"1941\").\n\nThe spring of 1978 was the season of \"Star Wars\" and \"Close Encounters.\" My friends and I would debate the qualities of \"Star Wars\" and \"Close Encounters,\" arguing as to which was the better film. For me, a junior high school lad, the greatest film in history was \"Close Encounters.\"\n\nI still love Spielberg's epic UFO creation, a sort of quasi-religious experience for a kid raised on \"War of the Worlds\" and \"Invaders From Mars.\" In \"Close Encounters,\" the aliens were friendly and most shocking of all - we were nice to them! This had not been done before, as the alien standard was a growling James Arness dressed as a murderous carrot.\n\nThese days I still get a child-like thrill when watching \"Close Encounters.\" The opening two-thirds of the film are no longer ponderous, but identifiable. The awkward situations of a struggling middle-class family are realistically portrayed. Paul Schrader, noted author of \"Taxi Driver\" and \"Hardcore,\" wrote the original draft to this film. One suspects the obsessions and frustrations of Richard Dreyfuss' character came from his tortured pen.\n\nDreyfuss plays Roy Neary, working-class father and husband who witnesses what he believes to be a UFO. He finds himself tortured by visions seemingly stuck in his head, and he becomes obsessed with UFOs. Like an alcoholic, Neary soon falls apart, losing his job, friends and eventually his family in several harrowing scenes. He befriends Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon), a single mother who has also witnessed these UFOs and is obsessed with similar visions. Her son is abducted by the aliens in one of the most terrifying scenes in film history. Together, this tortured couple eventually realizes these visions are mysteriously pointing them towards Devil's Tower in Wyoming. Frantically, they travel there even though the U.S. military claims a train wreck has caused deadly gas to cover the countryside. Scientist Claude Lacombe (Francois Truffaut) and his eccentric team have devised a musical language enabling them to communicate with the UFOs. The meeting place is, of course, Devil's Tower in Wyoming. Neary and Guiler fight their way to the mountain, stumbling upon a government-constructed landing strip where Lacombe and his scientists hope to meet the aliens. An enormous mothership appears and contact is made with aliens for the first time in human history.\n\nThis is not a simple story, and the drama which plays out between Neary and his wife (Teri Garr) is brilliant. Guiler's angst for her missing son is also perfectly portrayed by Dillon, one of the finest character actresses of this era. But the core of \"Close Encounters,\" the moment of truth so to say, is the sequence involving the aliens. There are so many hundreds of ways this scene could have gone wrong. The aliens could have looked fake, but they didn't. The lighting could have been wrong, but it wasn't. The aliens are portrayed as being just as shy as we are - a perfect choice.

It was a very brisk evening with little humidity, and the light pollution from the nearby highway took only a small portion of the horizon out of view.  It was the best night sky I've ever seen in suburbia in my conscious 25 years.  We spent I don't know how long staring into space, but for some reason that night every blinking ball of light on an airplane or any other airborne object was to me a UFO.\n\nWe began saying things like, \"Look at that one!  That one!\"  I believed for a long time afterwards that what I saw that one night were alien ships circling Earth, that we were not alone, and that it wouldn't be long before everyone else knew what I knew.  Of course I was a tremendous fan of Sci-fi films like \"Last Starfighter\", \"Explorers\", the \"Star Wars\" films, TV shows like \"Transformers\" (later on in life a show called \"Space: Above and Beyond\" would get cancelled much to my disappointment).  I was the believing nerd; you couldn't convince me aliens weren't real.\n\nEverytime I watch \"Close Encounters\" I get that same chill I remember from being six.  That sensation the actors have on screen when they look up at the sky and suddenly realize that there's more to watch for than just stars is real because I felt the same way that night.\n\nThe plot is about a middle-age man Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) whose family life disintegrates after a close encounter of the second kind with an alien spacecraft as he's called out on a job late at night.  Lost on the roads, he stops to check a map when suddenly  blinding lights appear from above.  No his truck doesn't go soaring up into a spaceship, no Neary doesn't get probed, instead his truck dies, there's a moment of anti-gravity, and Neary gets a nice sun-burn on one side of his face.\n\nUFO cliches die a happy death in this film.  The aliens are neither aggressive, nor are they provoked into being aggressive.  In fact, they are perfectly benevolent, if not partially enigmatic.  Spielberg wanted to show a range of diversity amongst the aliens that would be parallel to humans, so you have short, stubby aliens, lanky, stick-figure aliens, and also more humanoid aliens that are expressive.  Nowhere are there crop-circles, there are no long exegeses on their superior technology, no ray guns, no tractor beams or teleportations.  Meeting the aliens is actually a highly organic experience; achieved with colors, musical themes, and staring one another face-to-face.\n\nIn fact, nothing is really explained, it just happens and plays itself out.  How are these people having visions of Devil's Tower in Wyoming, the exact coodinates of the alien visitation?  How do they prepare the \"arena\" that's like a landing pad next to Devil's Tower?  What's up with the alien technology?  Do they have warp-drive capabilities?  Do they have anti-matter containment units?  Do they explore \"temporal disturbances\" like the crew of the Enterprise show after show?\n\nThe questions are all moot.  \"Close Encounters\" is just about the encounter, the experience, not about the calculator or the engineer.  If you're looking for explorations of futuristic technology and the \"Cool!!!\" factor, apply somewhere else.\n\nThis is somehow the reason why I come back to the night sky again and again.  I've heard more than one backyard astronomer describe the night sky as a reliable, familiar friend.  Herein lies the true form on \"Close Encounters,\" not that technology such as what the aliens possess exsists, or that we are enlightened by their coming.  What gives form to the film's premise is the possibility that when we look up at the stars, those stars are looking back.","summary":"The very full nighttime sky","unixReviewTime":1092268800,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

While obviously a film about aliens, Spielberg uses star Richard Dreyfuss as a chess piece to how the mystique and mystery of a foreign being can not only cause a man to go crazy, but can ultimately influence mankind as a whole.\nDreyfuss is extremely under-rated in his performance as a man driven to the brink as he experiences an otherworldy encounter with extra-terrestrials while inside of his vehicle.  Not knowing the affect this would later have on his life, he returns home as if nothing happened.  Dreyfuss's behavior grows stranger and stranger (he first makes a mountain out of mashed potatoes at the dinner table, then creates an even larger model of this mysterious mountain out of his yard while still inside his house), he realizes that he most confront this incredible feeling that has overcome his mind and search for answers.  What he encounters is magical and unbelievable.\nSpielberg's direction is top-notch and sincere, proving that his previous sucess was not a fluke.  Much like his other alien film, \"E.T\", \"Close Encounters...\" provides  a symbolic theme that is far more significant than what the aliens look like or what planet they came from.  With the peformance of Dreyfuss, Spielberg is able to to show that it is okay for all of us to return to the kid we once were, and to explore all of the questions that we all want answers for.  A true spectacle of a film with superb special effects, a wonderful musical score by John Williams, and a child-like charm that is for the whole family.","summary":"Close Encounters of the Third Kind  (1977)","unixReviewTime":1085184000,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

I have only really liked him in two movies -- George Lucas' American Grafitti and Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\nUntil recently, I had only seen bits and pieces of Spielberg's 1977 UFO classic. I never had the time or inclination to sit down and watch the whole movie. That is, until my current boyfriend (a true Spielberg aficionado) purchased the Collector's Edition DVD. We sat down in my living room and watched it.\nWhat surprised me about Spielberg's film is how well the story of a peaceful encounter between humanity and a spacefaring civilization is told. Not only are the 1977 special effects still effective, but the human interest part of Close Encounters was compelling. As seen mostly from the point of view of Indiana electrical engineer Roy Neary (Dreyfuss), the movie depicts the mystery and wonder of how we discover that we are not alone in this universe. It shows that even though Neary loses almost everything to the compulsion mysteriously implanted into his mind, he eventually finds that his sacrifices were worth it.\nThe movie is never boring. Instead, even though it's not a film like Star Wars with ray guns and explosions, it's fast-paced and interesting. It takes its cues from actual UFO sightings and other unexplained mysteries (such as Flight 19, the 5-plane training flight that disappeared off the coast of east Florida in December of 1945) and ends up with a realistic scenario for a \"close encounter\" between humans and aliens. The acting is excellent, and the young Spielberg got great performances not only from Dreyfuss, but also from Teri Garr (Veronica Neary), Melinda Dillon (Gillian Guiller), Francois Truffaut (Lacombe) and Gary Guffey (Barry).

Spielberg and others who worked on this film, used their imaginations to create positive symbols for the unknown. Roy who was played by Richard Dreyfuss, was child like in his excitement and drive to discover and learn more about his encounter. His child like desire seems to touch the viewer and get them caught up in the movie, feeling his fascination. He kept saying, \"I know this is important\"! The film has awesome special effects and for that time period was really spectacular. It is definately a classic, at least for me. The only sad part was that Roy's family left him. They seemed like a happy, busy, bustling family before Roy's encounter. Instead of supporting him, they turned away with fear and distance. I felt that was dissappointing. Although, I liked watching him build the mud mountain in his living room, if I was his wife, I may have drawn the line of support there. I also liked Teri Garr's performance. I think she is a good and funny actor. Wouldn't it be eerie to experience an encounter? It kinda makes you wonder if anything is being covered up out there, stuff they don't want you to know about???\nLisa Nary","summary":"Mystery tied with Positve Feelings","unixReviewTime":1063411200,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

While Roland Emmerich's ID4 is a throwback to 1950s \"invaders from space\" flicks, Spielberg's vision of a \"close encounter\" between humanity and extraterrestrials is more mysterious and, in the end, more hopeful and awe-inspiring.  Instead of exchanging bullets and \"heat rays,\" humans and aliens communicate by using musical notes.\nSpielberg's screenplay divides Close Encounters roughly into three acts, basically corresponding to each of the three kinds of  \"encounters.\"\nIn the first category, sightings of a UFO, we first see a very strange sight in the Mexican desert: an international team of researchers led by French UFO expert Lacombe (the late Francois Truffaut) and guided by several Mexican Federales finds five World War II vintage Grumman TBM Avengers.  The planes are abandoned but strangely intact, as though they were brand new.  \"Who flies this kind of plane?\" asks a bewildered cartographer\/interpreter named Laughlin (Bob Balaban).\n\"No one,\" replies another astonished researcher. \"This is Flight 19.\"\n(Flight 19, of course, is a reference to a Navy training flight which took off from Ft. Lauderdale one morning in December 1945 and vanished, along with a Martin Mariner search plane sent up to look for the missing planes and crews.  Flight 19 is now famous in the lore of unsolved mysteries related to the Bermuda triangle.)\n Laughlin is baffled by something else, as well.  A Mexican villager, old, sunburned, and seemingly delirious, keeps repeating, \"El sol salio anoche y me canto. El sol salio anoche y me canto.\"  When Laughlin asks what the phrase mean, a researcher who is fluent in Spanish says, in an awed tone, \"He says the sun came out last night.  He says it sang to him.\"\nLater, in the Indianapolis Air Traffic Control Center, a more dramatic close encounter of the first kind plays out on the radar scopes as airliner pilots call in reports of bright lights in the sky and unknown contacts make their presence known.  For a few tense minutes it look as though tragedy is imminent, but within moments the contacts vanish into the night sky.  Torn between reporting a UFO sighting or just letting the incident slide by, pilots and air traffic controllers alike opt to keep quiet, mainly to avoid having to fill out tons of bureaucratic paperwork.\nAs important as these sequences are, the focus of Spielberg's story is on Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), an employee of a Midwestern power company whose life on Earth is ordinary, hectic, and somewhat unfulfilling.  Sent out to investigate a section of power lines in rural Indiana (caused, of course, by the UFOs' passage), Neary has a close encounter of the first kind and impulsively goes on a truck-borne pursuit of two small \"flying saucers.\"  This sequence, which ends with a Keystone Kops-like police chase of the same UFOs, triggers an obsession within Neary that neither his wife Ronnie (Teri Garr) nor his children will understand, much less accept.  Neary, along with several hundred other people from different towns and states, will soon be haunted by both a visual image and a simple five-note musical phrase.  The traces of the UFO flights that leave traces behind (sunburn on people who, like Neary, were exposed to bright light at night) are known as close encounters of the second kind.\nSpielberg weaves Neary's everyman-faces-an-extraordinary- situation plot with the official investigations being carried out by the UN-sponsored Lacombe team and a more secretive U.S. government First Contact program.  These plot threads will all lead to a climactic and awe-inspiring close encounter of the third kind: actual (and documented) contact between humanity and another space-faring civilization.\nThe Columbia\/Tri-Star Collector's Edition brings not only a newly re-edited version (trimming some excess material from the 1980 Special Edition) of the 1977 film, but also comes with a second disc loaded with extras such as a Laurent Bouzereau documentary on the making of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, a 1977 promotional featurette, and the theatrical trailers.","summary":"We are not alone.....","unixReviewTime":1062633600,"vote":73.0,"image":null}

Including moi.  It not only wowed people with special effects, but a story line.  For once, an alien film didn't include corny music and screaming women standing out in the streets, or little green men shooting lasers or what not.  This film brought sci-fi films to a new degree.\nSo often, we see sci-fi films inter-relate with horror films, this is no horror film, it's a true sci-fi film.  The suspense does not come from terror, but from wonder and awe.\nI've read some reviews that state that you shouldn't show awe towards aliens that kidnap and brainwash people.  From what I saw, there was no brainwashing, and the kidnapping was not as big a deal as you may think at first.\nRichard Dreyfuss gives a hell of a performance in this.  He's an ordinary guy whose life gets turned around by these phenominal events, which are the sighting of UFOs.  Other ordinary people are effected as well.  This is the power of the film.  The heroes aren't these Indiana Jones or super experts who know \"everything\" about aliens.  They are people, like you and I, who have a drastic change of viewpoint.\nOther reviewers complain about Dreyfuss's character because he becomes obsessed with this phenom.  Well, excuse me, but if your entire world as you knew it was suddenly changed because you realized that there were higher forms of intelligent life out there, you might become obsessed yourself in figuring out the truth.  It's realistic and human to be curious.\nI think this movie was very realistic and avoided the corny, unrealism of other sci-fi junk.  The negatives of this movie is:\n1. Not enough Alien parts, meaning there needed to be more encounters with Dreyfuss or with other people.  There were only two, not counting the end.  This isn't enough, at least I felt, to get a good grip that this film is about Aliens and not government cover up.  Because the first third is about the Aliens impacting people's lives, while the other two thirds is government conspiracy or the recreation of Devil's Peak either through dirt, mashed potatos, or drawings.\n2. As a result, to not enough encounters with the Aliens, the film can be quite boring at certain points.  Now when I say encounters, I don't necessarily mean having more scenes where they fly around and buzz people with their space ships.  Not at all, I mean more alien phenoms, like the ship in the middle of the desert or the lost air planes now suddenly found.  These were great, there needed to be more of them.\n3. The ending.  I don't know, it was awe inspiring but at the same time real boring.  There needed to be a climax, and I think Spielberg felt that the aliens showing themselves would be it.  I'd rather they hadn't shown the aliens, that would've been more real.  Think about it, making contact with an entirely different species?  Not real.\nPlus, Dreyfuss just suddenly given the nod to travel with them, even though he's wanted by the government?  I mean come on, not real.\n4. Because this film has some lengthy, boring scenes, it's more likely than not this won't be an addictive film.  You may see it more than once but you'll probably allow a great deal of time to pass in between, because it's a film of wonder not a film of entertainment galore.\nAs you can see, there are some flaws that keep this film from being totally realistic.  But for the most part it is, and I liked it.  I think you need to see this film, you will enjoy it for the first time at least.  Seeing it again and again?  I don't know about that.  That's why it's four stars and not five.\nGrade: B","summary":"Worth seeing this encounter","unixReviewTime":1061251200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Though there is a serial killer on the loose, all he cares about is scoring some more weed...which, to most stoners, is pretty right on the target.  He comes to find out later that HE is actually the killer!  Big surprise!  I won't say anymore about the plot though.  If you've seen Evil Dead or Re-Animator, you're really in for nothing new to the genre.  The gore scenes are pretty interesting, but nothing to really single it out as a gore classic either.

Idle Hands is basically the same type of movie, only much sillier, much campier, and in some respects embarrassingly bad.  The filmmakers really don't even bother to explain the whole silly concept; a corporeal, murderous hand on the rampage normally doesn't need a lot of background info, but in this case Anton (Devon Sawa) simply has his own hand somehow possessed without the rogue hand causing all the mischief even finding him.  Only after Anton cuts his hand off, do we return to the more traditional animated, murderous hand on the rampage theme, and that works much better than Anton's constant battle to control what his right hand is doing as long as it is attached to his arm.  As far as the rest of the explanation goes, we have a Druidic priestess (Vivica A. Fox) trying to find and destroy the hand before midnight Druid time, at which time the hand will take a soul into the netherworlds.  In my opinion, this story doesn't even begin to work.\nA little bit of comedy is supplied by the always-funny Seth Greene (who plays Mick) and his buddy Pnub (Elden Henson).  These two, along with Anton, are the triumvirate of lazy, pot-smoking teens (just the type of victim said hand likes to prey upon).  Probably the funniest part of the film involves the reappearance of an undead Pnub and Mick (who carries his severed head around with him most of the time); the staircase to heaven, they said, was just too far to walk, so they decided to just stay on earth.  The only bright spot in this film, and the only reason I wanted to see it, is Jessica Alba.  I was somewhat amazed to see some of the facial expressions and attitudes she would later display in her role in the incredibly good TV series Dark Angel.\nIdle Hands is just too stupid to be at all horror-inspiring, and it is too stupid to even be funny for the most part.  I usually love these types of campy films, but in this case I would have to say that the fellow with the most idle hands of all was the scriptwriter, as he really didn't give us much of a story for this film.","summary":"Too stupid to be horrible or funny, but I love Jessica Alba","unixReviewTime":1066262400,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

In the light of current special effects, it's showing its age, but the story still retains wonder and interest.  Richard Dreyfuss is very effective as the man who sights a group of U.F.O.'s and then becomes obsessed with them.  Others that have made sightings share the obsession, including a woman whose child is abducted by the aliens.  A seed is implanted in their minds that draws them to Wyoming.  Their stories are intercut with the story of two scientists (played by Truffault and Baliban) who are investigating the strange re-appearance of ships and planes that have been missing for years, and which turn up in strange locales.  They, too, receive a message (along the more conventional method of radio contact) to head to Wyoming.\nDreyfuss logs the bulk of the screen time, and he easily carries the film.  As his marriage melts down in the wake of his obsession, he manages to maintain our sympathy and interest.  Truffault is a surprisingly effective actor, even when speaking through an interpreter.  Even the child that gets abducted has a great performance.  Likewise, the pacing and suspense through the first 2\/3 of the film is flawlessly executed by Spielberg, not revealing too much and intercutting short bursts of action with more contemplative and personal scenes.\nUnfortunately, the film grinds down to a deadly pace in the last 1\/3 of the film.  It is essentially 40 minutes of a faceless mob (of scientists) and Dreyfuss staring at the sky and watching lights appear and disappear.  Yes, the effects are good, even by today's standards, but it is boring!  Similarly, Teri Garr as the protagonist's wife is nothing but a carricatured harpy, and their breakup is clumsily handled by the immature (at the time) director.  All in all, though, the film holds up well to time and repeated viewings.\nThis DVD edition is quite nice, with a 100-minute feature with commentary and insight from most of the principle filmakers and stars (except Truffault, who had passed away).  Spielberg does not do commentaries for his films, but he talks a lot in the feature which should sate the film buffs.  There are also some deleted scenes, including the \"new\" ending Columbia demanded for the \"Special Edition\" release in 1980.  The original 1977 ending is maintained for the film on this DVD (and rightfully so!).","summary":"Nice DVD package, movie seems somewhat dated","unixReviewTime":1049328000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Plot: People from all walks of life are brought to the Arizona desert by a series of space ship visits to our planet earth.\nColumbia Tristar has really angered me with this release.  Steven Spielberg should be none too thrilled with them either.  Their 2 disc special edition presents his masterpiece in a digitally grainy, thoroughly unsatisfying visual quality topped off by excessive aliasing, shimmering and edge enhancement, low contrast levels, colors that bleed and an overall visual characteristic that ranges from too, too soft to digitally harsh.  There's no happy medium.  The arrival of the alien mother ship is totally ruined by excessive pixelization that breaks up fine details.  This is not the way I want to remember this sci-fi classic.  The soundtrack is dated but overall well represented.  The extras include a making of that is informative but a direct import from Columbia's laserdisc and some extra test and rehearsal footage that is somewhat dry.

But how can anyone sympathize with a man who willingly throws away his wife and children to follow some vague abstract space vision.\nAnd yet we're not supposed to think of Dreyfuss as a victim of an alien-induced obsession.  Rather, Spielberg wants us to be in awe of and admire these aliens who are, in Spielburg's view, a more intelligent, advanced enlightened species than the human species.  But the facts of his story completely contradict this Spielberg vision of alien goodness and virtue.  The aliens kidnap and\/or brainwash innocent people for no apparent reason and yet, because they're \"sensitive\" and intelligent, we're supposed to go \"awwww\" and think how wonderful they are.\nThe acting is fair but nothing special.  The only truly good acting performance is by Teri Garr who realistically and grippingly shows what is like to have one's life turned upside down by a spouse who's caught in the grip of an obsession.

The answer is a resounding yes, as the film conveys a sense of excitement, wonder and obsession. Differing from other nihhlistic sci fi films (The Alien movies), Close Encounters is a story of a Roy (Richard Dreyfuss), who, after having an encounter with a U.F.O, starts to become fixated with images and sounds that draw him to the film's conclusion. Roy is the everyman in this movie, and the film centres on a reocurring Spielbergian theme of extraordinary events happening to ordinary people.\nDreyfuss, ... is brilliant in this film, with his gradual obsessions and transfixion creating a fascinating film, which has become an undisputed classic.

Also the use of Devils Tower, a black monolith combined with the eerie choral overture is a Spielberg homage to Kubrick's 2001. It is interesting to note that the government organization that is researching the aliens use the illuminati pyramid as their symbol indicating to the audience the secret society connections, they even have their own flag. Also I believe that Spielberg is clearly pointing out to us by the way the aliens arrive in clouds and thunder with flashing lights that they may very well be the God of the bible. Them choosing a mountain to appear for communication, descending upon it in cloud and thunder is right out of the old testament. Also the smaller ships have a definite face or animal like appearance and remind one of the visions of the bible prophets and from a distance can appear like stars in the sky when they mimic the big dipper which could also explain the ancient worlds fascination with the stars. But to remove all doubt Spielberg holds a church blessing on the team that will be going back with the aliens, as the minister gives the blessing he reads from a passage of the bible talking about angels lifting us up and in the background is a Christian cross side by side with the star of David.

Originally released in 1977, Spielberg re-released it with additional footage in 1980, then altered it again for the film's 1997 re-release on VHS with the extra footage dropped and some scenes never released put back in. This DVD is the definitive version of Spielberg's classic, with the extra sections making the film's progress more involving than when it was first released.\nExtra stuff aside, does the film itself deserve a place in the collection of all-time great Science Fiction? The answer is a resounding yes, as the film conveys a sense of excitement, wonder and obsession. Different from other nihlistic sci fi films (The Alien movies), Close Encounters is a story of a man (Richard Dreyfuss), who, after having an encounter with a U.F.O, starts to become fixated with images and sounds that draw him to the film's conclusion.\nDreyfuss, who also starred in Spielberg's own Jaws (1975), is brilliant in this film, with his gradual obsessions and transfixion creating a fascinating film, which has become an undisputed classic. While perhaps not as essential as the 2 Disc version with lots of extras, CE3K is an impressive film in any format.","summary":"Spielberg's masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1035676800,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

Like all cycles in the movie business, this one has been brought down by the weight of too many cheap and derivative knockoffs When this happens, it finally doesn't matter if a movie in the category is good or not. People don't buy it. Ironically, the next big cycle was kicked off this summer by another, albeit more sophisticated and serious, horror genre - the psychological horror \/ ghost story [The Blair Witch Project, The Sixth Sense]. Idle Hands is further handicapped by being neither one of the best nor one of the worst of the \"scream\" cycle.\nIt starts off well enough. The time is Halloween. What other time is there? Young Anton's parents retire to bed. After the lights go out, they see an ominous message written on the ceiling. All hell breaks loose, and this sequence unspools like a twisted situation comedy. The next morning, Anton [Devon Sewa] wakes up, oblivious to the fact that his parents have gone missing. But then the teenager is oblivious to almost everything except drugs, sex and rock and roll, as are his two best friends, Mick and Pnub [Seth Green and Elden Ratliff]. As the day progress, it becomes apparent that one of Anton's hands has taken on a mind of its own. It has become homicidal. Most of the funniest moments in the movie show the boy and his deranged hand fighting for control. Devon Sewa, like Jim Carrey, is a very physical actor.\nIdle Hands is a homage to many old movies. The uncontrollable hand reminds me of a Peter Sellers character, Dr. Stranglove, in the movie of the same name. The opening pays tribute to Halloween, while the dance scene is straight out of Carrie. Anton's ghostly friends are just like the ones in An American Werewolf in London. One problem is that Idle Hands is nowhere near as good as the movies it salutes.\nThe bigger problem is that every character is self-centered and stupid. The writer and the director do not understand that, even when a movie is a horror satire, if the audience cannot relate to any character, interest quickly wanes. One morning Anton discovers his parents have been whacked, and, by that night, he's trying to make it with the girl next door. You can laugh at this idiot, but do you really care about him? This is not to say that there are no clever scenes in the movie. It is to say that the audience's involvement remains superficial. It's one of those pictures that leaves no impact and is forgotten by the next day.","summary":"Okay horror spoof ala Scream","unixReviewTime":1016755200,"vote":null,"image":null}

I absolutely love this film, it is filled with so much horror and comedy that you can't really put it into just one genre. \"Idle Hands\" is basically about pot-head Anton (Devon Sawa)whose right hand gets possessed by the devil and takes him on a wild (and hilarious) killing spree. The plot is simple, but the actors are what bring the film to life. Seth Green, Devon Sawa, and Elden Henson make the perfect trio of burn-outs and are absolutely hysterical. Jack Noseworthy is also good as the Motley-Crue-loving-motor-jock. The film is excellent, but what really brings this DVD to life are the features. We get a commentary by Rodman Flender, Seth Green, and Elden Henson, which is very informative and fun to listen to. You learn a lot of facts from the commentary; like how Seth and Elden won the role of Mick and Pnub, how Devon Sawa used a real butcher-knife for the hand-chopping sequence, Rodman poitning out numerous goofs and cameos by The Offspring, Ricky Martin, and a member of Blink-182, and many other little facts. The deleted scene is actually an alternate ending, which is totally different than the theatrical ending, and there is an introduction with Rodman Flender explaining why they cut it. Even though this ending is good, I still prefer the theatrical ending. Then we get some interesting storyboard-comparisons of two scenes, which are fun to watch if you really like the film. The production notes and talent files are okay, nothing special, and the making of featurette is good, you'll also learn some interesting facts and see how they did some of the effects. Then we finish with the trailers for \"Idle Hands\" and \"Can't hardly wait\". The trailer is good, it features a few glimpses of some cut scenes, see if you can catch em'.\n\"Idle Hands\" is a superbly crafted film that unfortunately bombed at the box-office (though I don't see why it bombed) and in a few years will probably become a cult-classic. \"Idle Hands\" is a solid buy, the special features are great and so is the price.","summary":"Hilarious horror flick.","unixReviewTime":1012608000,"vote":null,"image":null}

It really isn't a horror film but then it's not a comedy either as most of the humor, weed jokes aside, revolve around bad horror puns. The plot revolves around Anton, a completely worthless character, who basically does nothing but watch television and smoke weed all day. His friends are almost as bad but seem slightly more motivated than our dear friend Anton. Unknowingly to Ant, his hand has become possessed by evil since it has been idle, hence the title. He has already killed a boat load of people, including his own parents, before the discovery is made that his hand is evil. Present at the time of this discovery are his two friends who are quickly killed and then later buried only to rise up from the ground as Anton's undead friends. Oh, did I mention that the beautiful but slightly disturbed Molly (Jessica Alba) lives by Ant. Well she does and Ant, aside from the fact he is a total waste of space, actually hooks up with her, even with his evil hand. So Ant continues to kill and eventually lops of his hand with a butcher knife, only then to release the limb upon the world without the restrictions of a body. So he and his friends go in search of the hand, as the evil slayer (Vivica A. Fox) is also in search of it as she has been the entire movie in small little fragments of screen time. Everyone (Ant, 2 undead friends, Molly, demon slayer etc.) arrives at a school dance where Ant, after nearly being killed by the evil slayer, learns that he made a mistake in cutting off his hand as now it can more easily fulfill its purpose, which involves killing Molly at midnight. And no suprises here...it ends as you would expect it to end. Idle Hands compares miserably to the brilliant hand possession work done by Bruce Campbell in Evil Dead 2 but that has nothing to do with anything. It has ample amounts of gore, actors that make the script enjoyable (esp. the undead friends), and is something that you'll like if you enjoy horror and have that \"off\" sense of humor.","summary":"Horrifically Hilarious","unixReviewTime":999820800,"vote":null,"image":null}

Roy and others like him will embark on a quest that will lead them to first contact with aliens (hence the title).

Who will ever forget the final incredible half hour when the UFOs dance overhead bathing us with beautiful colours and light while communicating with us via music.

Heck, I was 11 years old when this came out and I LIVED in Muncie, Indiana when it was released. The theater went nuts when the subtitle came on, saying \"Muncie, IN\", and then seeing Roy wearing a Ball State University shirt, well that just got the crowd in the theatre all worked up. We loved it!\nI saw the \"Special Edition\" on VHS when it came out. I was a little diasppointed at the time when the scene with Roy tearing up his lawn was removed from that edition.\nHowever, I wasn't as disappointed with that version as I am with this. Many of the scenes from the 1st SE have been moved off to the second DVD as deleted scenes. A bad choice in my opinion. However, those scenes that were missing in the SE from the original release are back in with some other new scenes plonked in as well. Still, it's a disappointment with the other scenes missing.\nBut, the other features on the second DVD are great. But, I wish Columbia\/TriStar would take notice of how James Cameron released T2 - The Ultimate Edition. In that release, you have the choice of 3 versions of the movie on the same DVD: The original theatrical release, the Special Edition which came out a few years later on VHS, and then a third version with more deleted scenes in addition to the SE version. I don't know why Columbia\/TriStar\/Spielberg couldn't have done the same for Close Encounters.\nThe picture itself is great and the sound is excellent. Much better than the original release back in 1977, but of course, technology for sound has improved vastly since then, so it's not a surprise. Still, it's amazing how the sound can make a difference in how a movie is presented.\nTo have this on DVD is a must. Now, if Spielberg would release the Indiana Jones movies and Lucas would release the 2nd trilogy of Star Wars as well on DVD, my sci-fi\/action DVD collection would be almost complete.","summary":"Excellent movie - deleted scenes must be added back in","unixReviewTime":1023926400,"vote":40.0,"image":null}

Filled with great acting and mind-blowing special effects, \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" is truly a masterpiece.  And a magical John Williams score only makes it better.","summary":"A good Spielberg movie?  Of course!","unixReviewTime":1018483200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Bryan","reviewText":"Director Steven Spielberg's classic 1977 follow-up to \"Jaws,\" \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" stars Richard Dreyfuss as Roy Neary.  Neary's just an ordinary blue collar guy, a bit of a dreamer with a taste for Disney films and miniature railroads... until he witnesses a spectacular UFO appearance.  Haunted by mental images of a mountain he's never seen before, Neary risks his job, his marriage, his sanity and, eventually, his life to uncover what it all means.\n\n\"Close Encounters\" also marks the first appearance of the Spielberg formula.  You know, the messy suburban house, the mouthy kids, the whole \"just plain folks involved with something magical\" storyline.  And while he gets a lot of knocks, both justified and unjustified, for inflicting this on American movies in the 80s, Spielberg's use of documentary-like elements throughout (as the space people play some Burmuda Triangle-related tricks on what's apparently an international investigation team) and some funky casting (Teri Garr, French director Francois Truffaut, Bob Balaban and others) combine to lend this one a veracity some of his later films- and those of his imitators- sometimes lack.  This is a very fresh and original take on sci-fi subject matter, completely without physical violence (although there is some of the emotional kind).  Seeing decades later after so many heartless, bombastic, noise and light CGI fests, one can't help but admire Spielberg's ability to get to the emotional core of this material.\n\nPlus, it helps that the cutesy elements are kept to a minimum.  There's Melinda Dillon as a single mom whose oh-so-adorable-with-his-big-eyes kid gets kidnapped by the UFOs; the scene is played for scares, rather than laughs and it is genuinely terrifying.  Neary's kids are mostly unpleasant, and gone after the halfway point.  Dreyfuss downplays Neary's potential drippyness and plays up his frustration and rage as circumstances overwhelm him.  And Garr is very believable as Neary's doubtful wife; she keeps the character from becoming a one-note shrew.  You actually sympathize with her as she deals with what she thinks is her husband's selfish midlife crisis.\n\nThe film ends with an amazing sequence of events and actually takes on an epic scope without losing the human element that makes it all so enjoyable.  This DVD release follows the format from the recent \"Jaws\" disk:  a gorgeous widescreen print, a few deleted scenes, some documentaries.  A handsome release.\n\nLook for Lance Henrickson in a small role.  He'd later appear as one of the Mercury 7 in \"The Right Stuff,\" and investigate the unknown on \"Millenium.\"  And Carl \"Apollo Creed\" Weathers as a National Guardsman!","summary":"Well worth encountering...","unixReviewTime":1015286400,"vote":null,"image":null}

The first two times, I had seen it on TV, and kept getting interrupted.  Either by people talking so that I couldn't hear, or having to leave the TV and missing scenes.  So, when I finally got to sit down and watch this straight through, I was blown away like it was the first time.\nThis is one of those movies that you can watch no matter what mood you are in, and end up feeling good.  This DVD contains the best version of it, too.  There was an original and a special edition.  The special edition cut out the scene of Roy Neary (Dreyfuss) tearing up his yard and throwing dirt and stuff in his window for a scene of him breaking down in the bathroom.  Personally, I find the first scene to be more interesting and entertaining, but the second is more vital to the story because it shows that he thinks he's going nuts and so does his family.  But, not to worry because BOTH scenes are spliced into the movie.  Also, the SE had and extended ending of Neary in the spaceship which isn't spliced into this one.\nThis movie, no matter how many times you see it, holds you spellbound.  Everyone was brilliant in this.  Speilberg's directing, Dreyfuss's acting (his performance in Jaws was damn good, but nothing compared to this), Terri Garr's acting, John Williams' musical score (somebody give him a lifetime achievement award, or better yet, three), and Paul Schrader-that's right, Paul Schrader's-brilliant screenplay.  Yep, the man who brought you such masterpieces as Taxi Driver as wrote this.  Speilberg rewrote it so much, though (probably because it was too dark, as Schrader's work tends to be), and Schrader said he didn't want anything to do with the new script.  Regardless of who wrote it, it's perfect and entertaining as all hell.\nYou would think that a movie of this caliber, with such a climactic and intense ending, would lose it's power to leave you staring at the screen in awe, but it doesn't.  During the whole last half of the movie (the close encounter and the events leading up to it), I was not only riveted, I was anxious and nervous.  Just like the first time I saw it.  I was doing all those nasty habits I do when I get anxious or nervous, even though I KNEW what was going to happen.  That's how friggin POWERFUL this movie is.  Everyone knows the basic plot to this movie, but it doesn't matter.  It spins it web over you, and you can't help but get caught in it every time.\nNow, about the DVD.  Whoever put this DVD together is almost as brilliant as the people who made the movie.  It's 11 deleted scenes show you everything that was taken out of the movie (the extending ending, etc.), and then some.  The 100 minute(!) documentary is fascinating, if it had been any shorter(like those twenty minute ones, or even worse, one of those 7 minute \"featurettes\") I would have been mad as hell.  Again, hats off to whoever made it.  It also includes a featurette called Watch the Skies, which I admit that I haven't got around to yet, because I've been busy with the other features, and of course watching the movie!  But even if the featurette wouldn't have been included at all, the documentary more than makes up for it.  The DVD also includes trailers, which no one really cares about usually, but I always get a kick out of them.  The best thing about this, though, is the restored picture and sound.  The Dolby 5.1 sounds even better than the original sound!!!  And the picture is a million times better than VHS!  Definitely a noticeable difference!!\nOh yeah, the reason for my title is of course because this movie makes you use your brain, but it also leaves you feeling good after you watched with wonder as the close encounter unfolded.\nLet me just say that this is one of the best sci-fi movies.  Except most of it isn't a sci-fi movie, so you don't need to be a sci-fi nut to enjoy it!!  This DVD NEEDS to be in your collection!!!","summary":"A Thinking Man's Feel Good Movie?","unixReviewTime":1013990400,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

The added footage, however, really was tacked onto the end of the film, giving viewers a glance inside the Mothership of the UFOs that have been haunting Earth.\nCLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND: THE SPECIAL EDITION is an amalgam of the two films, preserving the best essence of the two pictures by creating one complete whole.\nPerhaps the greatest nod to this film is that there would be no THE X FILES without this film having been made.  CLOSE ENCOUNTERS paved the way found countless variations on the theme of extraterrestrial contact.  In fact, Spielberg himself had initially dubbed E.T. THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL as the unofficial sequel to CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, but he changed his mind last minute as the two films really have very little linkage.\nThis two-disc compilation boasts an excellent digitally mastered (audio and visual) product along with Dolby DTS and Dolby 5.1.  The second disc includes a Making of Documentary that gives some valuable history to the picture as well as commenting seriously on the films of Spielberg as a whole.  The deleted scenes add little to a film that already holds a complete rung on the ladder of the film industry.","summary":"As Close An Encounter As I Want To Own","unixReviewTime":1013472000,"vote":null,"image":null}

After all, it was a feel-good, non-violent film with a wide-eyed little kid in it, and nobody (except the cop in the car wreck), really got hurt. The aliens were cute and friendly, too.\nSome people, like Dad, have naturally made the mistake over the years of thinking that \"Close Encounters\" was just a kid's movie. But that was never so; if you take a close look, you'll see a very serious, intellegent film. There are really spooky, frightening moments that kids may or may not understand. Who can watch the abduction sequence or the Neary's encounter at the train crossing, and still say this was a kid's movie?\nWatching this film again, in pristine DVD clarity, reminded me of just how little talent and creativity remains in Hollywood these days. As awesome as the effects in \"Close Encounters\" were (and still are), they never overpower the human element. Today, sci-fi is filled with a glut of pointless CGI, explosions, cleavage, mindless action, and violence, in place of real human characters interacting. How refreshing to look back and see a film from a simpler, more idealistic time when ideas and original concepts still exited!\nI thought back to all the films and TV shows that came out around the same time; \"Star Wars\", \"Silent Running\", \"Tron\", \"The Black Hole\", \"Logan's Run\", \"Space:1999\", \"Battlestar Galactica\", \"Buck Rogers\". Heck, for that matter, even \"Damnation Alley\", and \"The Cat From Outer Space\"! Whether you liked any of these projects or not, all of them were highly original and different, unlike the tripe being force-fed to fandom today.\nThe new, original documentary on the second disc is very, very informative, and included there are all the deleted scenes (I at long last found out whatever happened to that cop who crashed his car!), the \"Special Edition\" extra scenes, trailers, and an original featurette from 1977. Interviews include Spielberg, Douglas Trumbull, Richard Dreyfuss, Teri Garr, Melinda Dillon, Bob Balaban, composer John Williams, the actor who played the child Barry (Cary Guffey), and others. Also, it's funny to see a young, beardless Spielberg!\nThis DVD version of the film keeps some of the Special Edition extra scenes added after the film was originally released in 1977, and the result is the best of both worlds. The film clearly states that, although the unknown may be frightening at first, we may not really have anything to fear.\nBest of all, we wisely do not follow Neary into the ship.","summary":"Not a kid's movie...","unixReviewTime":1012780800,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

It resembles a tv mini-series, long and plodding, and follows a select group of characters and their experiences with UFO sightings and abductions. I'm all for character development but most of these characters get stale really quick and you just want them to get on with it! As with many early Spielberg films, there are lots of noisy, irritating kids and messy houses which are meant to represent suburbia. After a long hour and a half, these people finally make it to Devil's Tower, where the aliens arrive and communicate with humans. This sequence is still dazzling, but basically just amounts to a spectacular light and sound show.

Steven Spielberg wrote and directed this tremendous science fiction film with his own distinctive middle-class view on things.\nRichard Dreyfuss is at his usual terrific best in the role of Ron Neary, another of Spielberg's \"Everyman\" characters.  He is an Indiana power lineman who is called out on a night where the entire city of Muncie goes dark.  Then, at a railroad crossing, he is suddenly shocked by the appearance of a UFO, flooding him with brilliant white light.  This encounter soon turns both him and his life upside down; his wife (Teri Garr) and kids can't understand his obsession with turning the shape of mashed potatoes or mounds of dirt from his backyard into a mysterious mountain he's been seeing in his mind.  Meanwhile, a lonely mother (Melinda Dillon) has her own close encounters with the UFOs, resulting in the still-unseen aliens abducting her son (Cary Guffey).  She too has visions of a mysterious mountain, visions which find their way into paintings and colorings.\nWhen the news comes on TV with word that a train supposedly loaded with deadly nerve gases has overturned in northeastern Wyoming, however, both Dreyfuss and Dillon know the locale--Devils Tower.  In spite of government officials closing the park off to outsiders (the nerve gas leak is an elaborate cover story), Dreyfuss and Dillon witness, along with a noted UFO expert (Francois Truffaut, director of the 1969 classic THE WILD CHILD) and hundreds of others, the first actual close encounter of the third kind--direct physical contact between Earthlings and extra-terrestrials.\nSpielberg's film was obviously a radical shift from most previous Hollywood depictions about outer space visitations to Earth.  He evokes the famous line \"Watch The Skies\" from Howard Hawks' 1951 classic THE THING, but does so without the paranoia and hysteria of the space invasion films of the 1950s.  There are no lasers or bug-eyed monsters.\nBecause CLOSE ENCOUNTERS was made after America's twin debacles with Vietnam and Watergate, it takes a low-key but rather apparent questionable view of the military and the government--as Stephen King put in his book \"Danse Macabre\", a \"don't-let-the-military handle this\" approach.  In its scope and approach, this movie is closer, in a middle-class way, to Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, which Spielberg has always numbered among his favorites, than to any sci-fi film of the past.  Dreyfuss and Dillon are excellent in their roles, as is Truffaut; and as for John Williams' score...what more needs to be said; it's brilliant.  CLOSE ENCOUNTERS (also known as CE3K) won an Oscar for Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography, though four other men (William Fraker, Douglas Slocombe, John Alonzo, Laszlo Kovas) are also credited.\nWell conceived, suspenseful, occasionally terrifying, and finally uplifting, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS is yet one more staggering masterpiece for a director with a whole lot of masterpieces still to come.","summary":"We Are Not Alone","unixReviewTime":1008288000,"vote":7.0,"image":null}

The writing is underdeveloped,  with a story that is, although has its moments, seems to be trying to hard  to be humourous while still maintaining its horror element - resulting in a  graphic gore element mixed with botched comedy.  This, like HALF BAKED,  seems to support dope smoking, although the interpretation can be that that  is the reason Anton's two friend's end up dead and he has a possessed hand  because he is lazy and is going no where with his life.  Yet this is  nullified when the kids still smoke it at the end, contributing the end to  `good marijuana'  The main character's name I figured was a nod to Anton  LaVey, who is the founder of the modern day Satanic church.  There is no  explanation given why Anton's two friends come back from the dead, other  than they just didn't want to go `toward the light'.  In a scene  reminiscent of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD they come out of the ground,  providing gross humour.  Like the horror genre it is more of a spoof of  than an actual example, there is nudity (two kids decide to fornicate and  are dressed in KISS costumes).\nAll in all, a bad movie that is aimed at  the teen-age genre with pointless drugs and a bad script.

I even kinda liked this movie when I first saw it all those many years ago. But we watched it with our kids (13 & 8) in the year 2000 and they hated it, and frankly, I dozed off myself. Science fiction is the hardest genre to keep fresh for generations, for obvious reasons, but some core elements of film-making never go out of style.\nIt feels so self-important and plodding. The pace is slow and the special effects no longer have the power to stun. And the movie doesn't really surprise.  There is no ultimate mystery to the plot.  Yes, one might wonder what the aliens are like, but we never doubt that they're there, that Dreyfuss will get to see them and that nothing bad will happen.  The movie never builds up any truly engrossing tension.  We feel safe throughout, and wouldn't you think that the world, getting ready to see aliens for the first time, would feel more frightened (and the viewer more frightened)?\nIt's fun to hear the \"alien theme\" music again, and Richard Dreyfuss is very good. But Francois Truffaut?? Why did Speilberg cast him?  He's usually so assured with his ununsual casting choices (Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams?  Great idea!  Roy Scheider in Jaws?  Oprah Winfrey in Color Purple?

Miller","reviewText":"The most telling thing about \"Close Encounters\" is that it's been out for a quarter of a century, and even Steven Spielberg doesn't feel he's *quite* gotten it right yet.  The 2001 DVD print is the \"Collector's Edition\", and is not the same as the version you remember from the movie theater, cable television, or the laserdisc (depending on how you were first introduced to the film).\nAs with Spielberg's later \"A.I.\" (also generally regarded as a misfire), this is a darker science-fiction fable than you'd expect from the director.  The sense of discovery and wonder is present from start to finish, in images and pictures if not so much in words.  The UFO display lighting up the pitch-black Indiana sky, or soaring over the Devil's Tower, haunted my dreams for years, just from seeing the TV trailers at a young age, long before I'd watched the movie.  From that stand point \"Close Encounters\" is one of our most enduring films.\nLess well-remembered is Richard Dreyfuss's role as Roy Neary, a man whose life is quite literally torn apart by his encounter and subsequent visions.  Almost unbelievably for a Spielberg film, Neary's marriage does't survive the film (Terri Garr does at least lends unexpected depth to what could have been a thankless role), and we're left wondering if he'll be reunited with his three children -- or if Roy Neary really cares?  The one family scene before his close encounter shows that he's pretty well alienated from his home to begin with.  Was he happy with his life before the flying saucers found him?  Will he ever return to Earth?  What does Spielberg mean by that U.S.S. Enterprise hanging in Roy's living room? :-)\nThe film is rife with Spielberg's great cinematic signatures and humorous touches (the UFOs, who are first mistaken for a truck pulling up behind Roy's vehicle, lift up and fly *over* him, but he's too busy reading a map to notice).  The final half-hour of the film is virtually dialogue free -- at least, in this particular edition -- and ends in a show of lights that mirrors the look of \"2001\"'s last segment, if lacking in that earlier film's impact.\nThe DVD transfer is, as others have said, a joy to watch.  The special features are a bit repetitive -- the making-of documentary is nearly as long as the movie -- and not all the footage from all the versions of the movie have been incorporated.\nMost Spielberg fans will not find this to be his most cohesive work.  Indeed, one day Spielberg may return to the picture yet again.  But the physical package is impressive, and the 4 hours you spend with these discs are 4 hours that you don't need to spend watching \"A.I.\"","summary":"Better than AI but still imperfect","unixReviewTime":1000598400,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

He might be thought of as one of Hollywood's sacred cows, but not everything he's done has turned to gold. A regrettable example of that would be ...Batteries Not Included in 1987. He has done his share of stinkers as well, but Close Encounters of the Third Kind, even more so than E.T., in my opinion, is his crowning achievement. I guess I have a bias towards Close Encounters as far as Spielberg films goes because it gives me such fine reminders of my early childhood (I was just five years old when it hit the theatres in November 1977). Trust me on this, this is one creepy film. Especially the special effects and the fact a lot of it was set at night, giving one the creepy feeling that one might encounter of UFO. Enough has been already said of the film that hasn't been already said. The film involves Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) who keeps having a recurring vision of Devil's Tower in Wyoming, which he is so compelled to go there that it ruined his marriage with Ronnie (Teri Garr). Devil's Tower was the location where Roy will encounter the giant mothership and communicate with the aliens. There are at least a couple of versions of this film. There was the theatrical version where Roy communicates with the aliens in the spaceship at the end but that's it. And then there's the 1980 Special Edition where you actually see the interior of the UFO that Roy went in to. I have seen both versions, so I should know. When you're younger, you mostly enjoy the movie for the visual effects and the fact you got to see aliens at the end (which look very similar to the \"Greys\" that real life people said they encountered when they were supposedly abducted by aliens). When you're older, you'll find out the movie has a lot of cover-ups and conspiracies involved as to why the area around Devil's Tower was evacuated (truly a treat for those who listen to Art Bell's radio program). It took me so long to figure out what was up with those fighter planes found in the desert, those were the ones that disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle in December 1945 (several months after WWII ended). If it was any movie that was perfect to watch at the drive-ins back in the 1970s, Close Encounters was truly that one movie. I am not much for Hollywood movies, because so much of it is so hyped and commercialized, or so mediocre, but this is truly amazing and needs to be seen.","summary":"This movie is amazing, my favorite from Spielberg","unixReviewTime":998265600,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

Things that only director Steven Spielberg can explain, which he does in his monumental epic of man's encounter with alien life, \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\"  Planes lost in WWII suddenly appear in a Mexican desert; a long lost ship turns up in the middle of the Gobi Desert; and in Dharmsala, Northern India, hundreds of people are gathered together, singing--a short \"tune\" that consists of a mere five notes, over and over, repeatedly.  When they are asked where they heard this tune, the throng, as one, dramatically thrust their hands into the air and point to the sky.  And, indeed, in the skies all around the world, strange things are happening.\nAnd even as these events are transpiring, one evening in Muncie, Indiana, the city is suddenly blacked out by an inexplicable power outage.  Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) is at home when it hits, and he is called in by the power company for which he works, then sent out in the darkness to an unfamiliar location.  Lost, he sits in his pick-up truck at a railroad crossing, studying a map, when all at once he notices a \"disturbance\" around him.  Mailboxes along the side of the road are clanging open and shut by themselves; then things inside his truck begin to move, subtly at first, then erupting and flying about as if caught up in a tornado--and then just as suddenly his truck is engulfed in a blinding light.  He leans out the window for a look, but it's too bright and he has to pull back.  Then just as abruptly, it all stops-- the disturbance, the light-- everything.  And he looks out the window again; but this time he sees something.  And though he doesn't realize it at the time, at that moment, his life changed forever.\nIn this wonderfully realized, highly imaginative film that is extremely well crafted and presented by Spielberg, he takes you along with Roy in the days that follow that strange occurrence in Muncie.  Roy becomes lost in thought, drifting, unable to focus on anything, much to the consternation of his wife, Ronnie (Teri Garr).  But he can't help himself; something-- an image-- has begun to form in his mind.  He has no idea what it is or what it means, but it becomes an obsession, and slowly it begins to take shape:  First in a handful of shaving cream, then in a plate of mashed potatoes, which he piles up and begins to sculpt with his fork, while Ronnie and his kids look on in bewilderment.  But he can see it in his mind, and it's like a mountain-- a mountain shaped like a \"tower.\"  And Roy isn't the only one.  Around the world, others are being drawn to the same image in their minds, and it's a force that compels them, pushing them on to find whatever it is, a power so strong in cannot be denied or refused.  They know only one thing:  Whatever it is, it's important, and they have no choice but to follow where it may lead.  And it becomes a great adventure, one in which they discover what Man has long suspected:  We are not alone.\nRichard Dreyfuss is perfectly cast as Neary, a regular guy-- he could be your neighbor or the man who comes to install your phone-- and gives a thoroughly convincing, introspective performance while creating a character with whom it is easy to relate and through whom you are able to share this unique adventure.  Garr does a good job, as well, as Ronnie, the wife concerned with her husband's sudden and seemingly bizarre behavior, someone with whom you can certainly sympathize.  Dillon delivers, too, as the single mother who suddenly finds herself caught up in these inexplicable and extraordinary events, and also turning in a memorable performance is the young Cary Guffey, as Barry, Jillian's son, who makes his own connection with the other-worldly visitors.\nThe supporting cast includes Francois Truffaut (Lacombe), Bob Balaban (Laughlin) and Lance Henriksen (Robert).  An uplifting, positive motion picture, \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" is thoroughly entertaining, as well as thought provoking.  Spielberg draws you in as few filmmakers can, with a great story and with characters who are readily accessible and with whom it is easy to identify-- all of which adds up to an absorbing, memorable and enjoyable experience, and a perfect example of the real magic of the movies.","summary":"An Amazing Story From An Amazing Filmmaker","unixReviewTime":996105600,"vote":null,"image":null}

In my pre-teen and early teen years, I was treated to the Star Wars Trilogy, the Raiders of the Lost Ark series, Star Trek - the Motion Picture, Superman - so many great movies for the young (and young at heart).  Out of all the great sci-fi and adventure films of the late '70s and early '80s, I always liked CE3K the best. The best quality of Steven Spielberg has always been his ability to provoke a sense of wonder, and nowhere is that more evident than here.  We marvel along with the characters at the strange happenings of the early movie, and Dreyfuss and company convey perfectly the astonishment of the breathtaking mothership.  Where Star Wars was a fairy tale, Close Encounters is an intelligent look at what might take place if \"we are not alone\".  As for the DVD edition, I'm perfectly happy with it - the goodies are nice, and let's face it, the whole \"inside the mothership\" thing was never going to match our imaginations, anyway.

Nevertheless communication between alien species can't be easy. They don't quite know how to go about contacting us and become a bit of a 'bull in a china shop.' Their methods are inexplicable and cause somewhat of a tumult on Earth, but that's why they're aliens, right? We're not the same. Why should we expect them to think the same as we do, with the same respect for personal boundaries and behavior? The complexity that went into the creation of the aliens' behavior and culture is one of the things that makes this movie so interesting.\nRichard Dreyfuss, still spry and angst-ridden in his youth, is terrific as Roy Neary, an electrician whose contact with the aliens leads him to obsession and ruins his domestic life.\nOf course, the most enjoyable scene in the movie is the first real contact between humanity and the aliens with the best part of the musical score on display.\nThe only thing missing on this DVD is the option to view the movie INCLUDING the missing scenes like the ones aboard the spacecraft. You can view the deleted scenes, but it would have been nice to view them as part of the movie as we were able to do when a special edition of the film was released back in the early 80's.\nStill, great job and beautiful digital transfer.

But maybe that's why Close Encounters of the Third Kind earned its #64 spot on the AFI top 100 ranking. It's a mystery story infused with real life with shades of quite plausible science fiction. And, that all being said, human relationships are the focus here.\n\nDreyfuss is a normal man living a normal life. Alien spaceships, visually beautiful, begin visiting far-flung locations on Earth. They are revered by some, while others are threatened, and yet others refuse to accept it's happening. It's not that there are Good Guys or Bad Guys. It is more how all of us react to a knowledge which is new and strange. Do we hide from it? Embrace it? If you're a mother, do you let your child get drawn off by these unknown creatures? The movie does a great job of showing all sides, how the aliens *might* be friendly - or they *might* be a threat. How can one know? The government is trying to get a handle on things without causing a panic. Is that a proper response? Anyone who's seen the TV series 24 knows how tricky that type of decision can be.\n\nGarr plays Dreyfuss's wife, who while skeptical, does also try her best to understand him. She goes with him to the press conference. But to her it's as if he claims to have seen the loch ness monster. He's already lost his job over this. How about her kids? How much can she let her husband's \"bizarre behavior\" affect them? When he flings a heavy plant through a window and at her head, and starts ranting while stealing fencing from his neighbors, many would say she's quite right in taking her kids to safety.\n\nThen there's Dillon, who plays the mom of a young boy who is taken away. She is determined to get her child back. So while Garr runs away with her kids to protect them, Dillon teams up with Dreyfuss to get hers back. When Dreyfuss is falling back on the mountain, it's Dillon who kicks him into gear. I did find it a bit iffy that a short while later Dreyfuss gives her a fairly warm kiss on the mouth. How quickly he forgets his wife. And kids. And it's also a bit strange that Dillon, knowing her son is probably with the aliens, doesn't want to go too. If I was a mom and my kid was in there, I'd be heading down to get on board right alongside Dreyfuss.\n\nIt's amusing that some of the alien music ends up sounding Jaws-y.\n\nThe government does send two females in their nearly all-white-male submission to the aliens. And the movie features the two women in the cast showing two different points of view - the one who shies away from the aliens for her kids and the one who goes towards the aliens for her kid. But really, 99% of the movie is about men. The two women never talk to each other and barely see each other as they pass in one scene. Dreyfuss has one woman to take care of his kids, another woman to empathize with his dreams, and it doesn't seem like he gives his family even a passing glance before he hops the next spaceship out of there. He created those three kids - but he was apparently \"meant for so much more\". They annoy him with their talk of fractions and mini-golf.\n\nAnd one has to say, if the aliens can figure out our long\/lat system and have advanced physics, surely they could learn English in a week or two of monitoring our TV signals and simply talk with us. Not nearly as much fun as teaching us slowpokes an entirely new musical language.\n\nSo yes, as much as this positions itself as the intellectual counterpart to Star Wars, it's still not as tightly written as many other movies out there. That's all right. It's more an artistic romantic vision than an intellectual examination. This is a man's fantasy about escape. He has women to care for the various aspects of his life, he has the freedom to escape, and he goes. He throws caution to the wind and hops on that space-schooner into the unknown. It gets kudos for its portrayal of that simple desire to head off towards the horizon, and its presentation of aliens as a pleasant rather than dangerous force.\n\nWell recommended.","summary":"Escapist Fantasy with Visuals","unixReviewTime":992390400,"vote":null,"image":null}

It's not so much about the aliens as it is about the people, namely Roy, who they touch somehow.  How these people become obsessed with UFOs or whatever.  As for the UFOs themselves, Speilberg teases us with small sighting near the beginning of the film, a tense scene at the house of the little boy, and some finds of missing planes and ships.  Other than those few scenes, it's more about the characters and you don't really see much about the aliens until the big pay off scene at the end.  And as for that scene, it's worth the buildup.  Even 20 some odd years after the movie came out, with the advancement of special effects and everyting, the climax still manages to be awe inspiring.\nThe extras are great as well.  Some really good deleted scenes here, about 11 in all, some dealing with the chaos of Roy doing his work when the power goes out, some dealing with Roy's obsession with the sky and the infamous inside the spaceship ending that was in the Special Edition.  I also really like the scene with the policemen filing their reports.  A couple of old trailers for the movie, it's interesting to see how they advertised their movies back in the day.  And my favorite, the in depth documentary.  This baby is as long as a movie by itself and it has tons of info on the movie, everying you wanna know.  I love it when a disc goes all out on a documentary, as I find the behind the scenes stuff, the stories to be told and the looking back on stuff intriguing.  This movie whets my appetite for Spielberg DVDs for now, much like Jurassic Park and Jaws did when they came out.  But like those movies, it won't be long before I crave MORE Spielberg on DVD!  Bring on E.T., bring on Indy, bring on Shindlers List, bring 'em all on!","summary":"An awesome DVD of a great movie.","unixReviewTime":991699200,"vote":null,"image":null}

The 1980 re-release added a couple of scenes including the ticket-selling final sequence inside the mother ship.\nThe DVD version of Close Encounters contains neither the original version nor the Special Edition.  Instead, DVD owners are treated to the \"Directors Cut\" that \"...can be seen and enjoyed as he has always intended...\".  This basically means that the sequence inside the mother ship is cut out (a sequence he never wanted to do anyway) and a few scenes that were included in the original were put back (including a favorite scene of mine of Roy taking plants and fencing from the neighbors to build his mountain).\nI personally love this director's cut.  I must admit my initial viewing ended in disappointment when the final mother ship sequence had been removed.  After watching the phenomenal documentary on disc 2, I understand why it was taken away (you can still view the scene as part of the \"deleted scenes\" portion of disc 2).\nThe documentary really gives the view a renewed appreciation of what it took to make this film.\nWe've waited a long time for this DVD and it doesn't disappoint.  It deserves 5 stars (though it would have been even better had it included the parody, \"Closet Cases of the Nerd Kind\").","summary":"Finally here, and worth the wait...","unixReviewTime":991612800,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

For the special edition, Spielberg had to make some promises to Columbia about showing the &#8220;inside of the ship&#8221; before they would give him the money to &#8220;finish&#8221; a film he had to rush into the can because of the studio's budgetary problems in 1977 (watch the included documentary). The result is breath taking. It will ruin you for all the ...expensive film currently washing through theatres in the U.S. (no names &#8211; I'm sure by now everyone has their favorite stinker for this year, even though it's only June).\nThis was not a cheap movie. Many effects, including Spielberg's trademark use of  &#8220;cloud tank&#8221; skies were perfected for this film. Not everything worked the first or fourth time they tried it. Columbia ran low on money while Spielberg was polishing off the second edit, replete with footage added. I argue that he just did not want to stop touching his movie until he was forced to. My proof is that there are currently three versions of this film, two of which have additional footage that was added by Spielberg after BOTH 1st and second unit were wrapped up.\nThis is not Spielberg's magnum opus: I believe that is in the future. As a director he is growing and changing and building on all those glorious films he has given to the world, rushing towards a pinnacle that will change film forever. Not all of them worked. This one did. The result is what our parents used to experience in a dark theatre years ago when people's lives changed based on what flickered before them on a silver screen. Magic. And for just shy of three hours, this magic will be yours again, in your homes, with your families, for as long as your VCR or DVD functions.\nA truly great artist understands that people want to dream, and be lifted into worlds away from those familiar, if only for a little while. Spielberg is a truly great artist. This was his third film.","summary":"The Birth of Legend","unixReviewTime":991267200,"vote":null,"image":null}

The intervention of extraterrestrials in our society starts a real panic among many people, and at the same type mesmerizes some who are invited in a way for the grand coming that is announced by this open show of power and benevolence. Then the film analyzes the reaction of authorities. Military authorities are obsessed by limiting the contact of these ETs with the population, hence they evacuate the area where the meeting is supposed to take place, they establish a whole fear and even fright process to convince the population that they must go away or stay away,and they constantly think of danger, instead of thinking of potential opening. On the other side the scientists, strangely dominated by a Frenchman, are jumping on the occasion to open their minds, to seize the day, the night and the new vistas that open up to them.\nThe capture of a child gives a tremendous sentimental and affective dimension to these contacts, because he does not know fear and only sees what it is for him : a contact with a new toyland, with new playmates. The whole deal is to surrender all the men the ETs have captured over the previous decades, and the equipment with which they had been captured, such as planes and boats, in exchange for a new batch of volunteers to go with them for exhanges and a visit to this extraterrestrial world. The suspense in the film is created by a man who was visited a couple of nights before on the road and who manages to go through all barriers and to impose himself on the trip, with the complicity of the Frenchman.\nWhat is admirable in this film is that the ETs are shown as absolutely mature and our society, at a scientific level, as being ready to experiment, to take risks, to engulf in an adventure. It is a very positive approach to the problem and this is refreshing. Steven Spielberg manages to literally mesmerize us by organizing a real ballet of light and colors and music as the way these ETs can communicate with us (music and colored lights) and can demonstrate they power as well as their total un-agressiveness (the ballet of lights and beautiful movements  in the sky). He also evades the necessity to show the ETs by blurring their rather childish forms in a nearly blinding light. They are only shadows in this light, and this keeps some kind of mystery in the encounters.\nThis film is refreshing, optimistic and the perfect counterbalancing vision as opposed to the totally urban paranoid approach of many authors, the latest book on the subject being Steven King's Dreamcatcher. Here we understand we must not be afraid of them or their coming, because, and definitely more than us, they want to know, to exchange, to build together with us rather than destroy and annihilate.\nDr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.","summary":"Discover our distant lovers from outspace","unixReviewTime":990576000,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

I have always been interested in stories about UFO's and this was the firs movie I ever saw in the theaters that dealt with them. When viewing this film back in the late 70's, I was just mesmerized in a way that no other movie has been able to achieve again.\nThe story, the music and the magic surrounding this movie are very powerful. The \"hidden\" subplot of the UFO's bringing out the artist in the people who saw them is very clever and an important part of the film.\nIt is hard to go into details about this film because it is so good. I will point out the infamous last 1\/4 of the film. Using music as a way of communication is simply brilliant. It is an illustration that music is indeed the universal language along with math.\nNo other \"UFO\" movie with the exception of \"Contact\" has ever come close to the majesty of this movie.

Why? Because we can identify more with a middle-aged electrician than we can with a moisture farmer on a desert planet. Richard Dreyfuss is the aforementioned electrician, who has an extraterrestrial experience and suddenly is obsessed with these aliens. This epic is an excellent early work of Stephen and truly delights the senses as well as the mind, and is still extremely watchable today. Now, for the faults. It starts slow and never really builds to a frantic pace, but it only increases the suspense. Although the aliens are a little disappointing (just the basic pointy-eyed, almond faced stereotypes), these faults are easily compensated in this amazing experience.

Don't worry about cattle mutilations or any of those other violent abductions you've been hearing about, everything's all fine and dandy.\nThe first half of the movie was good, but for some reason they decided to turn it into some watered-down, cheesy, leave-the-audience-feeling-secure kind of movie during the last half. Another reviewer mentioned the movie 2001 and compared it to Close Encounters, all I have to say is that they're completely different from each other- one has a philosophical message and one doesn't. Basically this movie is for those who wanna lie to themselves and say that there's nothing to worry about. 2001 is definitely the movie to see if your interested in aliens- im not saying it's real (who knows though?), but its sure more engaging than Close Encounters.","summary":"Stupid","unixReviewTime":972259200,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

The first movie to explore aliens from the vantage point of someone  who could be your neighbor, or YOU, is fascinating and utlimately  surprisingly moving.  The visual wonder of this movie is so palpable you  can almost touch it with your hand, and the performances are so in synch  that you become friends with these people by the time the Mother Ship  arrives -- especially Melinda Dillon and Richard Dreyfuss; Teri Garr is as  usual excellent, and Francois Truffaut is the perfect man to embody a  sympathetic scientist, filled with wonder.  When communication between  humans and aliens begins to explode, I found tears welling up in my eyes,  so complete was Spielberg's magic spell.  The fact that this movie  essentially features no real villian is remarkable; it manages to be  profoundly funny, sentimental, interesting and magical without any real  violence and no real character conflict\/battle.  John Williams once again  provides a score of majesty and power; the creative collective genius who  concocted an alien encounter entirely through music, whether it was  Williams, Spielberg, the writers, or a combo, deserve(s) special mention,  and Williams' theme evokes precisely the right emotional chords to  transport you to the galaxies above, or at least to heaven.","summary":"SPECTACULAR AND AWE-INSPIRING","unixReviewTime":945993600,"vote":12.0,"image":null}

To wit -- the scene where Ed Harris brings the dying Susan Sarandon a christmas tree, long after they have separated.  The scene which Julia Roberts confronts Susan Sarandon with some evidence of her duplicity and challenges her to obtain the truth:  \"Are you dying\/\" and Susan Sarandon  looks her straight in the eye and says \"Not today.\"  Those two words have become a kind of personal mantra for my husband and me, and in my estimation, this mere chickflick has approached the epitome of unsentimental veracity, for a few moments only, but what moments! --These few scenes rescue the movie from the heap of  terminal illness schlock.

Thousands of viewers can relate to the heartfelt story, especially in today's world, where children have relationships with parents, and step-parents. Susan Sarandon plays the role of a divorced mom, who devotes most of her time to her children, portrayed as a caring, and loving parent. Her ex-husband is Ed Harris, who is involved in a serious relationship with another woman. Julia Roberts plays the role of the other woman. When the two women first meet, they don't agree on much, and there is obvious resentment of the manner in which they both have different point of views in dealing with the children.\n\nSusan Sarandon eventually has no choice, but to let her ex-husband and his new love know that she has cancer, and time is not on her side. As time passes, the two women try to be more compassionate for the peace and tranquility of the family, as they try to understand each other. This uplifting story tugs at the heart, and Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon give outstanding Acting Performances. A movie that grabs your attention in the very beginning, and keeps you there.

But this is still a great movie as its leads bring their characters to life on the screen, allowing us to sympathize with their troubles...and perhaps choose sides in their disagreements.  Susan Sarandon, Ed Harris, and Julia Roberts are involved in a triangle as they work to adjust to one couple's divorce and the other's pending nuptials.  The child actors, Jena Malone and Liam Aiken, were also great as the kids not happy with any part of the situations.  These kids were given distinct personalities and each one made the absolute most with what they had...job well done.  Sure, the ending was totally sad and corny all at once, but it worked so well that I won't complain...instead, I'll credit the cast for making it work so well.

Much of that is due to the story that tends to be a bit Hallmarky (written by Gigi Levangle and manipulated for the screen by Jessie Nelson, Steven Rogers, Karen Leigh Hopkins and Ronald Bass) but with Chris Columbus' direction and a cast of incredibly talented actors is really works.\n\nAnna (Jena Malone) and Ben (Liam Aiken), the two children of Jackie (Susan Sarandon) and Luke (Ed Harris) Harrison, have to cope with the fact that their parents divorced and that there is a new woman in their father's life: Isabel (Julia Roberts), a successful photographer. She does her best to treat the kids in a way that makes them still feel at home when being with their dad, but also loves her work and does not plan to give it up. But Jackie, a full-time mother, regards Isabel's efforts as offensively insufficient. She can't understand that work can be important to her as well as the kids. The conflict between them is deepened by the sudden diagnose of cancer, which might may be deadly for Jackie. They all have to learn a little in order to grow together.\n\nThe lightness of the film is highlighted with some very entertaining Karaoke takes on popular music as performed by mom and the kids and by a little Thanksgiving talent show.  But over and above the cutesy schmaltz are a lot of well shaped statements about life and death and family.  It remains a very fine movie.

Julia Roberts, naturally, is very good to look at, Susan Sarandon is not bad either; despite this, they play the parts of the wife-to-be and the ex-wife excellently. The modern, hip, touch is that the wife-to-be is living with the ex-husband and husband to be, Ed Harris, in the role of step mom to his children, who, in the course of the things, will become her step-children.  Ed Harris, manages to keep smiling ,playing fifth significant person to the two women and, in point of fact, to his 12 year old daughter and ca, 8 year old son. This is the kind of film in which men are just a backdrop to the two women (as in the days of Davis and Hopkins).\nThe film goes on too long for what it has to say, becoming tedious by the Christmas Day ending.

It is mature in that it isn't some silly thing about removing the barriers to falling in love - by far the easiest part - but in how to move on after a divorce.  The actors are extremely fine, and their characters evolve throughout the entire film:  the left-over mom is angry, the stepmom is a rather hard-edged career woman, and the kids are expressing pain and hostility in their own way.  Happily, the husband is not a simple jerk, but a guy working very hard to help everyone along the way to whatever comes next.  The way that they all adapt is entirely believable, bringing a realism that you rarely see in love films, and this is surely about love.\n\nUnfortunately, there are certain scenes that don't quite ring true to me, in particular those involving the kids and their rock.  The siblings get on way too well, in particular the young son is way too accommodating and nice.  But overall, it is done with sensitivity, funny without being a comedy, and sad without being a melodrama.\n\nRecommended.  It is nice to see something this sophisticated coming out of the Hollywood mill.","summary":"very good tearjerker","unixReviewTime":1287014400,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

I'm not really a big Susan Sarandon fan but she was good in this movie.  It revolves around the lives of the step mother conflcting with the mother from the previous marriage.  The kids in this movie help liven up the movie and unfortunately haven't been in any big name future films since.  Jackie ends up getting cancer later in the movie which will bring tears to your eyes in some scenes.  Isabel (Julia Roberts) is pretty much an artsy photographer who is considered \"hip\" by Jackie, the mother of the children.  They have to put up with Isabel's poor motherhood instincts like accidentally \"losing\" one of the children in one scene.  Later in the movie you grow to like both mothers.  Even the father Luke gets likeable later in the movie as his character becomes more real.  The cast of the movie is pretty talented.  This is one of the better films Julia Roberts has been in.  While \"The Pelican Brief\" is my all-time favorite of hers, \"Stepmom\" is still worth watching even though it's an older movie.

He has two children, a young boy named Ben (Liam Aiken) and a teenage girl named Anna (Jena Malone), with his ex-wife Jackie (Susan Surandon).\n\nJackie does everything she can to undermine the kids relationship with Isabel short of coming out and telling them to hate her.

This film is a roller coaster of emotions: love, jealousy, hate, anger, regret, loss and so much more is portrayed within a few hours.\n\nThis is one of my favorite dramatic comedy films starring two of my favorite female lead actresses.

When watching this film, I will agree that many, if not most, of the plot is totally predictable.  You might see things coming from early on.  But this doesn't steal from the fact that Julia and Susan are wonderful actresses, with a wealth of facial expressions and sublties that make them all the more captivating to watch.  Ed Harris doesn't do much more than stand around here, unfortunately.

Then of course, Step Mom was directed by Chris Columbus and when I see his name on a film I know I'm going to enjoy it...Harry Potter, Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, Nine Months, and the list goes on.  I wouldn't choose this 5 tissue film over, let's say, Terms of Endearment, or Beaches, but for me it wins in the category of Real Life Situations played with true talent by well known popular actors.","summary":"Worth watching","unixReviewTime":1128816000,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

Though I found this movie moving, emotional and at times fun, it lacks in truth.  Considering I've been through a divorce with my parents and my father remarried, I know how it is, somewhat.  I know it isn't the same for everyone but I get the jist of it.  As always, Susan Sarandon is infectious (no pun intended), she's one of the most brilliant actresses alive, maybe ever.  Julia Roberts is tough and upfront while Ed Harris shows an emotional, quieter character who doesn't have as much film time as he should.\n\nThe two children, Sarandon's and Harris' children are played extremely well.  For their ages, they act similar to what would happen.  The younger boy doesn't feel much different except asks 'mommy, if you want me to hate her [meaning Julia Roberts], I will' - typical for a young boy to side with his mother but also not be angry at the other woman in his fathers life only because he doesn't quite understand yet.  The daughter however is like pin point.  She's angry and doesn't seem to give Isabelle [Roberts] a chance.  When Isabelle brings home a puppy to try and win her love, she exclaims she's allergic to dogs but is actually lying.  She doesn't want Isabelle to think she is giving her any part of her.  She \"hates\" her.  The movie is mainly focused on how Anna hates Isabelle and how they bond.  The unrealistic part is how Roberts character and Sarandon's character coexist towards the end.  I'm not saying it could never happen but it's a little over the top.  In all, this is a good family film, a good movie for people going through that type of situation, I somewhat wished I had seen it before or while I was going through the same thing.","summary":"Good but somewhat unrealistic","unixReviewTime":1094256000,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

But let's face it. Home Alone was pure unadulterated emotionally manipulative schlock. The guy's made his mark directing the kinds of teen comedies John Hughes wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole (and Hughes even wrote Home Alone. One wonders why he didn't direct...). With Stepmom, Columbus has all the schlock with none of the cuteness of the child actors. Not that said cuteness ever made his films watchable previously.\nThere is only one actress in Hollywood who can make Julia Roberts look like she can act, and that is the detestable Susan Sarandon. While Sarandon has been nausea-inducing in a number of roles, this one goes above and beyond the call of duty. Sarandon's character, Jackie Harrison, is the ex-wife of hapless Luke (Ed Harris, showing once and for all that no matter how good an actor you are, if the script makes you look like an idiot, you will look like an idiot). She can't stand Luke's new girlfriend, Isabel (Roberts), and for that matter can't seem to stand much of anyone, including her own kids. Jackie is as loathsome a creature as the average viewer, and most non-average viewers, will ever want to meet. Were she male, she'd be on the Lifetime Movie network in a wifebeater T-shirt, throwing beer cans at the football game and smacking the kids around, and everyone would hate her. But she's female, and she's in a Chris Columbus movie, and so we're supposed to sympathize. (Oh, and to make sure we do, not far into the film she's diagnosed with cancer. Because that's an excuse to be [a jerk].)\nJulia Roberts has only managed one decent role in her career, and that (Flatliners) lay in the strength of the rest of the cast. The fact that she can be singled out here because of the weakness of the cast around her says volumes. I could easily go on for another half-hour about the painfully overdramatized script, the shameless attempts at emotional manipulation throughout, the pedestrian camerawork, and the fact that, even though he's working with adults, Chris Columbus is still directing teen feel-good-because-everyone-bonds movies. But there are so many more deserving things to give bad reviews to out there I can't justify spending any more time on this painfully bad piece of dreck.

Director Chris Columbus (Harry Potter, Mrs. Doubtfire) superbly directs the well-defined script that not once questions its ability to work. Though an intelligent group of screenwriters and a good director are behind the film, it definitely reflects the typical Hollywood-tear jerker, but with quality.\nThe film focuses on the Harrison family: Luke (Ed Harris), Jackie (Susan Sarandon), and their two children Anna (Jena Malone) and Ben (Liam Aiken). The wealthy New York family has all of the love, but all of the fights, especially those which have come from Luke and Jackie's past divorce. Luke's new love interest, and fianc, is Isabel (Julia Roberts), a stylish, young, New York City photographer. She has absolutely no motherly experience, and is really not ready to be a stepmom, especially since the two children are indisputably close to their very maternal mother Jackie. From this, a slight feud between Jackie and Isabel comes about. Isabel is unhappy of how Jackie sees her as so irresponsible and careless, while Jackie is not ready to be replaced by someone with no parental experience. But after the family learns devastating news concerning Jackie's health, Isabel and Jackie must learn to get along, whether they are going to share motherhood or not.\nThough there are some smiles and heart-filled scenes, the emotional and dramatic script offers a typical family drama story, in which a family is sometimes torn apart by the horrible consequences that life brings sometimes, and the difficulty of changes. Fortunately, the story plays out well with great direction, two amazing lead-female stars (also with executive producer spots), and a plot that keeps the audience emotionally attached throughout the film.\nMalone and Aiken impress, as the emotionally hurt children that are suffering from their parents past divorce, while they must cope with Isabel, their soon to be stepmom. And despite some mild film-making don'ts, STEPMOM has few flaws, and truly shows us how \"family\" is more than just a word. The DVD features a \"making of featurette,\" film trailer, and both Widescreen \/ Full-Screen versions.","summary":"Roberts and Sarandon Make 'Stepmom' Moving and Emotional","unixReviewTime":1038009600,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon were outstanding choices for the lead roles because they truly knew how to fit the types of characters they were playing. Susan Sarandon is Jackie Harrison, a highly devoted mother who is an outstanding example of a woman who loves and places her children above herself. Her ex-husband Luke (Ed Harris) finds a new love, Isabel (Julia Roberts). The whole situation is difficult for Jackie and both of her young children, especially her 12-year-old daughter Anna, who resents Isabel. When Susan is diagnosed with fatal cancer, it becomes absolutely necessary for the two kids to learn to accept Isabel. Many, many hardships and challenges rise between Susan and Isabel before they are finally able to put aside their differences, become friends, and figure out how to handle the future of their family--a future that they can no longer deny. I especially liked this movie because it deals with such serious and complex issues that many of us can at least appreciate if we have not experienced it ourselves. You really feel the tone of the issue through Anna, Susan's oldest child. She is such a horrible brat, you want to kick her, but then you soften when you realize that she is just scared and upset because she loves both of her parents, and it is hard for her to get through all of the changes. Any of us can understand or even relate to that. Although I enjoyed most aspects of this movie, I really loved the way Susan taught her children not to be afraid of her death, especially her very young son. There's no greater way to show your love for your child than by putting on a brave face during the scariest moment of your life in order to spare them the fear that you feel yourself. It truly is touching the way Susan loves her kids so selflessly in this movie. It's very deep, very moving, and worth the money to buy.

It sat around my house for a few months before I finally opened it and played it.  I had been a little reluctant to see it because, even though it stars one of my favorite actresses--Susan Sarandon, it looked like a stereotypical oversentimentalized \"chick flick.\" I was pleasantly surprised.\nThere is not one false note in this movie.  The screenplay, courtesy of a whopping FIVE writers (which usually spells disaster for most movies), sticks very close to reality.  We get a sense that these characters are three-dimensional and REAL, and not merely functions of the plot.  The tension between the estranged wife (played by Sarandon) and the title character (played by Julia Roberts) is palpable and believable, with no one being made the saint nor the villian.  These characters have virtues and faults just like anybody else. They also have clear reasons and MOTIVATIONS for the way they feel, and for the things they do.  Ed Harris, as the man standing between the woman he loves and the woman he once loved (and still cares very much for), also rings true in his performance and makes us feel the inner tensions felt by his character.  I even liked the two young actors playing the kids, and the way their parts were written: these are real kids with real feelings and emotions, and are not just there to look and act cute.  They are caught in an uncomfortable situation not of their making, and we really feel for them.\nAlthough the last half-hour does reflect certain conventions of Hollywood dramas (\"Terms of Endearment\" comes to mind, a little bit anyway), STEPMOM never falls into cliche` territory.  It deals with the situation bravely, and doesn't lose its step.  By the end of the film, I felt like I knew these characters and cared about them, because they contained aspects of real people I have known.\nBasically, if you like to watch a good family-centered drama every once in a while, then I definitely recommend this movie.

The movie has it laughs, tears, and an upbeat attitude that keeps going throughout, telling its story in an appealing fashion with the help of its brilliant cast and director Chris Columbus. You can enjoy this movie for everything it has to offer and feel satisfied in the end with how you spent your time; I did.\nJackie and Luke are divorced, which is emotionally taxing on their two children, Anna and Ben, Anna refusing to accept the fact that her parents are never getting back together again. Ben is too young to understand much of what is going on; he merely aides Anna in making Luke's girlfriend, Isabel, completely miserable. This includes hounding her for unwashed laundry, putting down her lunches, and just about anything they can to make it look like they have been treated with less care than they would under their mother. The movie's setup of these relationships between different characters is well-done, keeping its focus on the children's actions and their feelings on the situations they are put into.\nAs most ex-wives will do, Jackie is condescending of Isabel, looking down on her as a self-centered woman who cares more for her work and personal life than for the children under her care. They have many sparring sessions and heated arguments, but it's clear that they cannot argue forever, and as the children begin to warm to Isabel, so does the friendship between Jackie and Isabel begin to form. Soon, they are helping each other through tough times, trading tips on caring for the children, but still maintaining that small spark of conflict which will surface time and again as Jackie realizes her children are no longer solely under her influence.\nThe movie deals with a lot of real-to-life family issues that will hit home with most viewers and is sure to strike an emotional chord in audiences everywhere. One of those issues is the fact that a divorce is more about how to deal with the children than about getting on with life. The movie does not take away the focus from the childrens' feelings towards their situation. At one point, Anna stands up and shouts, \"You didn't ask me if I wanted a new mother!\" The story is still about the feud between Jackie and Isabel, but this feud centers around what each of them feels is best for the children, keeping with the fact that in a divorce, they are the ones who are most affected.\nActors Jena Malone and Liam Aiken, Anna and Ben, do a terrific job in bringing out all of that emotion and feeling in their characters. Aiken's character is not required to be as emotional as Malone's: he is only eight years old in the movie, and does not clearly understand what his parents are going through. He is merely along for the ride, going with what his parents say and what his sister wants, and Aiken brings all of that childhood innocence out perfectly and with believability. Malone must provide a much more involved role: her character is older, and lashes out against her father for leaving his mother and preparing to be with a woman half his age. Malone is full of tears, anger, and laughs, and her performance is heartwrenching and convincing.\nAnother issue is embedded in the relationship between Jackie and Isabel. Jackie has the maternal instinct where Isabel is trying her best, and the story is intensified emotionally by the clashes in how they feel the children should be raised. When Jackie realizes that Isabel is going to be a permanent part of her children's lives, she also comes to the realization that she cannot keep arguing with her about how to raise the children. As they come to an understanding of one another, it's intriguing to watch the two actresses interact onscreen.\nSusan Sarandon is plays Jackie, who is stubborn and becomes quite disturbed when Isabel steps onto her turf. She brings out all this emotion and feeling, as well as her actions and reactions, convincingly, matching the performance of Roberts, her opposite. Roberts is Isabel, and she brings all the brightness and charm of her own person into the role while also maintaining a short emotional fuse. It is easy to see that the two actresses are having fun in their roles, and their pairing for this movie is outstanding. Their performances make this one of the best movies of the year. Ed Harris plays the part of Luke, who knows how Jackie feels but wishes that she and Isabel would be able to come to an understanding of one another. His performance is earnest and warming, and like his costars, he makes his role believable and interesting.\n\"Stepmom\" is one of those feel-good movies that was able to keep my interest throughout. There is a twist in the plot that I dare not even mention, because the filmmakers and producers have done a pretty good job of not giving it away in the promotional material. There is a lot of love between the characters, brought out by the stellar cast and a director whose films in this field have excelled. Based on emotional depth and connectivity, \"Stepmom\" is a nice piece of heart that is filled with true human feeling.","summary":"Focuses on family and children.","unixReviewTime":985996800,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

Isabel spends a large part of this movie trying to find a way into the two children's lives and to have them accept her as part of theirs.  And of course this is never easy.  The role of Mom(Susan Sarandon) is built as a strong character who has endured her husband leaving her and is trying to raise her kids with shared custody.  She is often characterized as the one who can do no wrong.  The plot thickens as the children and the audience sees Luke wanting to marry Isabel and then their mother falling sick with cancer.\n  This was a truly outstanding film both because of the actors themselves, but also because it brought the audience so close to the heart of the film.\n  I would definately recommend that anyone see this movie, especially if you need a good cry or if you are a parent going through a divorce and\/or remarriage.  It may encourage people to be a little nicer to each other and see what a difference it may make to the children who too often get stuck in the middle.","summary":"Have your Kleenex ready!","unixReviewTime":980035200,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

It features a mostly terrific -- and consciously sentimental -- screenplay that allows its two stars, Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon, to cover new territory as actresses.  The biting, realistic dialog between two strong, competitive women resonates with the ring of truth.  The children in the movie shine throughout, and Ed Harris is, as usual, appealing, masculine, bringing gravity to his role as the man in the middle.  The Christmas settings, the snowfalls, the terminal illness, and the classic song \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" all combine to produce more than a few well-earned tears, none more so than in the final ten minutes. Chris Columbus, the director, allows delicate, and sometimes not so delicate, humor, to ease the real pain of many of these well-wraught scenes.  The Hollywood gloss notwithstanding, this is one of those human, heartfelt explorations into some unchartered territory.

It was a film that required him to open with the comedic chops he's honed so well but then, because of the deepening of the film's story from comedy to drama, requested so much more of him. He ultimately delivers in spades.\n\nThis is really a story about a son moving very fast in the fast lane of advertising. He's a pro and he loves what he does. He's also a personality that lives on charm and in the moment.  But when his parents separate after years of marriage, his life changes rapidly from no personal responsibilities to a multitude of them. It's also begs a question that rarely gets told well- how do sons and daughters deal with parents as life turns the tables and we suddenly start having to deal with listening to and taking care of them? The changing of roles and responsibilities. As the film unfolds, it presents those concerns with proper weight, depth, sadness, growth and understanding.\n\nGary Marshall directed the film prior to his mega hit with Pretty Woman but I really think this is the better film of the two. He draws the best from Jackie Gleason, Eva Marie Saint and Beth Armstrong and Hector Alonzo- each lending a real ensemble cast feeling to the piece and although Tom Hanks shines- so do they.\n\nJackie Gleason deserves special mention because he really plays a rather hard, sad man at the end of the road as a clothing salesman, and he digs deep, never lending anything false to how this man thinks, feels and operates. The exchanges between him and Hanks about how he was raised lend a real truth to the role.\n\nIf you're looking for a film that has some humor and some depth of feeling in the same breath, this is an interesting evening's viewing.\n\nAn underrated film that deserves a second look and a larger audience.","summary":"Cats in the Cradle Revised","unixReviewTime":1155600000,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

Both do a fine job as a father and son who really have no use and less understanding of each other.  Of course, there is a crisis (actually a series of crises) that forces them to choose further alienation or reconciliation.  You will have to watch the movie to find out - and I encourage you to do so.\n\nTom Hanks plays David Basner, a young and talented up-and-coming ad executive.  He is in all ways the flower of the YUPPIE ethos including the pre-AIDS casual attitude towards sex and relationships.  Gleason plays Max Basner who is a way past his prime manufacturers rep for a children's clothes manufacturer.  Max is by all accounts a difficult and angry man who used to be quite a charmer and ladies man.\n\nEva Marie Saint plays Lorraine Basner.  Lorraine was trapped into a marriage some would call loveless, but it is much more complicated than that.  Again, you will have to watch the movie to learn all the subtleties, but during the film she decides to break free and \"find herself\" by walking out of her home and marriage to file for divorce and get the first job of her life.  Both Max and Lorraine begin relying on David in ways that reverse the parent - child relationship and put a real strain and the solo life and upward career path David is enjoying.\n\nTo complete the sea of troubles, David is in the middle of trying to land a huge airline deal for his firm that would likely make him a partner and has also developed a mutual attachment with Cheryl Ann Wayne (played by the amazing Sela Ward) who is important on the airline account for multiple reasons.  Plus, there is the old friend who really needs to be more, Donna Martin, played wonderfully by Bess Armstrong.\n\nSome have criticized the movie as having two minds.  The stuff at the office is fun, raucous, aggressive, and often very funny.  The Basner family saga is often very painful.  I actually found the clash of these two stories more or less realistic.  Many young professionals experience a much different life at work than at home and that leads to a lot of stress, broken marriages, and lots of counseling hours.\n\nWhile I am not thrilled with all the choices the characters make along the way, I do think the movie ends in a good place - though some might find it maudlin.  In my view, the character that comes off best is Charlie Gargas, David's Boss, played by the always effective Hector Elizondo.\n\nOther reasons to view the film again are the very young and pre- Homer Simpson Dan Castellaneta, the now strange 80's fashions, and the wonderful exchanges between David Basner and the deadpan secretary, and Conrad Janis on trombone with his jazz band (however briefly).\n\nI think the best reason to see the film is the performance delivered by Jackie Gleason.  It is a tour de force of how to provide humanity to such an unsympathetic character.  There is much subtlety and skill in his portrayal of Max Basner and it is very memorable.","summary":"More serious than you might expect for a film this funny","unixReviewTime":1101859200,"vote":9.0,"image":null}

Sela Ward also appears as a love interest, along with Hector Elizondo as his boss, and Eva Marie Saint as Hanks' mom.\n\nThe only thing that gets on my nerves just a little is the soundtrack.  I think it's Christopher Cross, surely one of the most annoying alleged musicians ever to hit the big time.\n\nThe transfer to disk is good.  The cast is excellent.  The plot makes sense, and the script is near perfect.  The story is about the relationship between Tom Hanks' character, David Basner, and his father, Max Basner.  Its a wonder that anyone comes out right as an adult, and Hanks had no idea how screwed up his childhood had been until the night his father told him his mother had split.  And soon thereafter his secretary gave him a message that his mother had called, and added \"I had no idea you had parents.\"\n\nWonderful.  Buy it, enjoy it.","summary":"Donna Mildred Martin","unixReviewTime":1046995200,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

The film has a bunch of good laughs (especially by Jackie Gleason and Tom Hanks.) I don't have any problems with the film. But, the topic of having to put one's job on hold, divorce, and having a family member with a severe illness is very stressful. Since the film talks about diabetes, Jackie Gleason had diabetes in real life and didn't take good care of himself. But, I'm not going to go on about that. The film is just nicely done and a good closing film for an iconic figure (Jackie Gleason). The moral that I learned from this hilariously underrated comedy of the 1980s is that even though someone has an important job to do at work, that certain person has to look after members of their own family since that's an important responsibility and Tom Hanks was smart enough to do just that.","summary":"Good film with good moral value","unixReviewTime":1420070400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Both are very talented in their own ways.  I had not seen this film till today.  Not even sure why I suddenly wanted to watch it.  This is early in Hanks career and the semi-manic, rapid fire manner in which he juggles his way through a scene is already firmly in his grasp.  He is fun to watch.  The script is where I would prefer to focus my criticism because the actors were all quite fine.\n\nThere are other write-ups that will identify this as one of the best father - son relationship movies, ever.  I would hardly cast my vote that way.  For example, one of the most scorched earth movies that is everything that this film is not, \"Affliction\" with Nick Nolte and the late James Coburn is a smouldering, simmering volcanic dynamo.  \"Nothing in common\" by comparison is way too kosher, safe and aimed for middle America, taking very few risks and staying rather formulaic.  The comparison I draw might be unfair because there are many other father son movies and plays that far outshine this film.  For example \"Death of a salesman\", perhaps the greatest of them all, is an invitation to examine the dark side of family traffic.  Nothing in Common, watched now in 2014, seems by comparison to be a product of its time.  It suffers from not taking the emotional risks that real families in deep distress actually live through.\n\nGleason was robbed all his life of enough dramatic roles.  While a wonderful television icon he excelled in the very few really meaty dramatic roles and sadly we got to see too little of that.  In this film he is not given enough room to stretch his personality beyond the crabby old and sick man that he has become.  His character is not allowed to share the grief he continues to bottle up.  You spend a few minutes watching the interactions in \"Affliction\" and you can see what better scripts and raw gestalt can do for dramatic effect.\n\nI think that this film suffers from trying to be two things at once: a very light comedy and a light weight drama.  It would have been better served, in my view, by sticking with one version and strengthening the focus.  These were actors who could perform, all of them and its a shame that they were not allowed to show the pains of family stresses in a more forthright manner.\n\nI don't want to say that the film has aged badly.  It is a product of a Hollywood system that pushes product downstream into the market and cares much less about making bold statements.  By the reckoning of my own tastes, I enjoy a more visceral drama, one in which there is danger lurking beneath the rising blood pressure.  Will something suppressed, something urgent finally be said?  In fairness the strength of the film is in the last 20 minutes where the dramatic heat comes as close to a boil as the script allows.  I found myself sitting quietly and barely moved at all throughout the viewing.  It is a tepid affair and I would not recommend it too much, especially in light of what Tom Hanks went on to.  I needed to see something more substantial here;  perhaps I had nothing in common with the film?","summary":"Not hot, not cold; rather a room temperature family drama.","unixReviewTime":1409702400,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

He has just been promoted to a window office, and  everything seems to be going perfectly until his father, played by Jackie Gleason, announces that his mother, played by Eva Marie Saint, has moved out. Jackie Gleason plays himself - a cigar chewing, joking, clothing salesman who has lost his edge and can no longer adapt to new sales methods and is losing clients until the firm eventually fires him.\n\nDavid walks the tightrope between his grumpy, ailing father and his mother who wants to start a new life with someone who will love and pay attention to her. He finds out more about their relationship than he ever wanted to know in some rather emotional scenes.\n\nOut of a sense of responsibility, Hanks tries to take care of his father, urging him to go to the doctor for his failing eyesight. Meanwhile, Hanks is working on a campaign for a major airlines and wooing the sexy hard-working daughter of the chairman of the airlines. He is torn between the demands of his job and his family, though his dad is irascible and demanding and ungrateful and his mother can't forgive his father for a lifetime of neglect and antipathy.\n\nDavid learns a lot from his parents' marriage and from the other relationships in his life and matures considerably throughout the film. By the end, he's more than just a womanizing, hard-charging prankster ad executive. The ensemble cast (Eva Marie Saint,  Hector Elizondo,  Barry Corbin,  Bess Armstrong,  Sela Ward,) is quite impressive, ensuring that watching this nearly 30 year old film will be an enjoyable experience. However, I had to wince at the hair and make-up and clothing styles of the 80's - did I really wear such huge shoulder pads?  I'm sure I did !","summary":"Fun Flashback with an Emotional Message","unixReviewTime":1406246400,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

There's a good message at the core of this one, about the impenetrable veneer expected of men from his generation and the dire effects it bore on those around him. Hanks, a smooth-talking corporate '80s ad exec, and Gleason, a foot-to-pavement salesman struggling to deal with the end of his career, manage well with the heavy stuff while occasionally injecting a few welcome dashes of humor and sarcasm to the mix. The film is flawed, though, in its unbridled lack of restraint. Every last supporting character hints at a big, convoluted back story and many of them are halfheartedly explored. That diverts attention away from the key players and leaves us with what seems like one big, fuzzy, unfocused batch of incomplete or unfulfilling arcs. There's simply too much to keep track of, and too much time wasted with characters we don't care about. Noteworthy as the stage where Hanks showed he could be more than just a comic player, but otherwise it's too overstuffed and vague to recommend.","summary":"Muddy but Well-Intentioned, This is More Drama Than Comedy","unixReviewTime":1404172800,"vote":null,"image":null}

I seem to be a VERY picky person when it comes to Tom Hank films.  Besides Forest Gump, I mostly only like his ultra serious films, such as Saving Private Ryan and a few others that escape my mind at the moment.\n\nI still believe Tom Hanks hit the high point in his career around 10 years ago.  He didn't exactly start out as an incredible movie star.  It took him a long time to get going and win over movie watchers.\n\nHowever, Nothing In Common turned out to be good.  Not GREAT by any stretch of the imagination- just barely good enough that I recommend sticking through the first hour of useless storytelling in order to get to the good stuff (the good being Tom Hanks' characters relationship with his father).\n\nThe first hour of Nothing In Comming features nothing but Hanks' character trying to sleep with a few different women, and he ends up succeeding.  I guess these moments are supposed to qualify as humor, or romantic-style humor, but for me it doesn't exactly work because there's no interesting storyline development while this is going on.  Some of the other characters he communicates with is rather unexceptional and pointless to include in the story as well.  Makes me wonder what movie writers were thinking back then.\n\nThe film is also SEVERELY dated.  It's definitely stuck in the mid 80's, right down to the ugly predictable pacing and the wimpy music that's supposed to pass the test as \"beautiful\" and \"fitting the mood\".  Prepare yourself for a huge smack of the 80's right in your face as far as the soundtrack and presentation is concerned.\n\nAt least the relationship between Tom Hanks' character and his father actually got good starting around the halfway point, otherwise this would have easily been a 1-star forgettable (and laughable) movie for Tom Hanks.  He moved on to *much* better things later on.","summary":"improves later","unixReviewTime":1269993600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Before he made the ill-advised \"Philadelphia\" and then the cleverer \"Forrest Gump\", Hanks was actually a fairly broad comic actor. Some of his movies hit the mark, like \"Splash\" and \"The Money Pit\", and others bombed badly, like \"The Man With One Red Shoe\" and \"Bachelor Party\". He was great at playing overly-confident, affable yuppies that were almost always put-upon in the extreme or finding themselves in odd situations, like he did in this one.\n\nIn this movie, Hanks plays David Basner, a hotshot adman in Chicago, with comical co-workers and upper-middle-aged parents that are breaking up. While he tries romancing the daughter of a major client, (Sela Ward, hubba-hubba!) he also has to deal with his poor father (Jackie Gleason) losing his wife of 40 years and his job, all within the same month! The \"tough love\" tenderness Basner uses with his dad is offset by the kid gloves he uses with his mother, played by Eva Marie Saint. There are some ingenious comic scenes in this film, such as the ad company presentation to the Texan airline owner client, father of the Sela Ward character, (the woman with the guitar voicing the old lady on the plane is priceless,) and some other ad proposals are done well too. However, it is the later scenes with Max, his father, that will probably get to you the most. This was Jackie Gleason's last movie, and it is LIGHT YEARS better than most of the stuff he starred in late in his career, specifically the \"Smokey & The Bandit\" movies and \"The Sting II\". Hanks would go on to make \"Joe Versus The Volcano\", which was really Meg Ryan's movie more than his, his last broad comedy, and then made \"A League of Their Own\", which changed his career as well as saved it. There was no looking back after \"Philadelphia\", which was actually his first totally dramatic role.\n\nFrankly, I kinda miss the affable yuppy Hanks and would love to see him in another \"Money Pit\".\n\nWhaddya say, Tom....huh?","summary":"One of Hanks better movies....","unixReviewTime":1171065600,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

I admit I loved watching this because her performance is so spectacular.  Probably one of the best I've seen her do.  It's unfortunate that her performance wasn't in a better film, but this film is good.  You can't compare it to the book which so many are doing.  I think by this time we all know a movie will never be as good as a book.  This could've been a lifetime made for movie, but instead it was a feature film.\n\nMichelle plays Beth Cappadora who heads to her high school reunion with her kids only to have her youngest child abducted.  We're taken into the whole gritty scenario of what would you do if this happened to you?  How would you react if your child is missing for 15 minutes and then two hours later and no sign of him and the police are there.  You would be a mess!  How would you be each day thereafter with no sign of him.  Imagine it.  Nine years goes by and the kid is more grown up and shows up at her front door to mow her lawn.  He matches the description of the projected images that the FBI made him out to look as he got older.  I won't tell you what happens, but you get the drift of the turmoil this poor family goes through.  Michelle falls into the rabbit hole of emotions giving us some of her most brilliant acting work on screen.  The movie is tragic and even more tragic that it wasn't more seen.  I personally enjoyed it and found it to be a nice dramatic family film.","summary":"Michelle Pfeiffer is brilliant in this","unixReviewTime":1353283200,"vote":null,"image":null}

The writing is mostly good with a few exceptions, and the way the story keeps you attached to the TV screen is definitely one of the positives.  I seriously wasn't expecting such a phenomenal performance by all the actors and actresses involved.  Putting into words what makes this movie so great is very difficult since there's so much attention to emotions and specifically, crying (not exactly tears of sadness either, which is what's so surprising).\n\nWith all that said, I can't help but think Michelle Pfieffer's character was slightly and oddly out of whack when she first reacted to her young son getting kidnapped in a crowded area.  Her immediate reaction was confusion and only a slight bit of worry.  Considering how many people were around, and given the fact her son was only 4 years old, it's hard to believe she wouldn't freak out more.  As harsh as this might sound, I'm almost glad she eventually responded with a nervous breakdown when the reality set in that her son is actually missing.  This scene saves the whole segment.\n\nI suppose as the weeks turn into months and the months turn into years, it's somewhat normal for a mother (and father) to move on by removing pictures of their child and pretending the child was never in their lives (or that the child was in their lives at one point, but recognize they are now a distant memory).  Then again... I've never been in such a situation (kidnapped son or daughter) so I can't say I would have responded the same way.  Given how I usually keep pictures on the living room hutch and never take them down, I suppose I'd have kept the pictures if he were my child.  I wasn't sure if Michelle's character was throwing away pictures of her son in the trashcan or, since she was a photographer, throwing away pictures of the things she used to find meaningful (since she's now depressed and her perception has faded).  This is where it gets confusing- Michelle's character was secluded and depressed... I think.  I'm not 100% sure she was.  Her character felt off some of the time so her behavior was hard to understand.\n\nEven more unusual is the father who was more than ready to move on with business related stuff.  The oldest son -who was standing directly beside his younger brother in that crowded area during the kidnapping- was reacting even more unusually by not showing even the least bit of concern (as evident by the way he was playing his Game Boy at the breakfast table and showing signs of happiness or rather expressing feelings that \"It's no big deal\").  This is more the result of bad writing I believe.  The kid probably should have felt *somewhat* responsible for his brothers disappearance despite his young age.  We *do* find out later he was more than old enough to understand what he'd done wrong however.  Of course it could be argued that what Michelle did was wrong too- leaving two young boys alone for a moment and not being confident enough to know exactly where they were standing amongst the chaotic crowd.  That's not a smart parenting decision.  Then again, leaving kids alone and assuming no harm will be done is a common feeling among many people so I can't really blame her there.\n\nMichelle's character eventually settles into a \"Oh that makes sense- that's how a mother should react to such a traumatic situation\" but the father and oldest son were never really given the same kind of believable treatment, which makes me think the writers intended to focus the film around Michell Pfieffer's character and reactions all along.  Hey, she was the most popular actor\/actress the time it was released after all.\n\nAnyway, when the kidnapped son miraculously comes home under the most hard to believe circumstances (he was living 2 blocks away the whole time?) this is when I'm certainly confident in giving this film a solid 5-star rating.  The kidnapped son was the best actor in the entire movie.  Whether it be his reaction to having to move away from the man he once called his father and suddenly having to radically change his lifestyle with his real family (that he barely remembers and therefore feels out of place) or the way his upbeat personality has a knack for bringing out the raw emotions in his older brother and mother, he definitely steals the show here.  No doubt about it.\n\nOh and what's up with that scene where the parents were fighting and the oldest boy walks up to his baby sisters crib and smuggles her mouth?  I THINK the reason is because he wanted her to cry so their parents would stop fighting and quickly run to the bedroom, but the boy could have found a better way of ending that argument than putting his sisters health in danger.  I guess it can be chalked up to \"Kids will be kids\" and do silly irrational things.\n\nOverall, an emotionally award-winning performance all around.","summary":"wow, surprisingly awesome","unixReviewTime":1346630400,"vote":null,"image":null}

It's the story of a busy mother, Beth Cappadora (Michelle Pfeiffer), whose son Ben is kidnapped at the age of three. Nine years later, Ben is found and is reunited with his family, but he doesn't have much interest in getting to know them and is resentful about being yanked out of his old life.\n\nI enjoyed this movie. It's pretty true to the novel, and the few things that were changed for the film aren't all that important. I think the biggest difference between the book and the movie is that the character of Beth is much more toned-down and sympathetic on the big screen than she is on paper. Mitchard's version of the character is more interesting and complex, but I can see why the producers probably thought it wouldn't do well on the big screen. Pfeiffer delivers a strong performance, as does Jonathan Jackson, who plays the oldest Cappadora son, Vincent. The only casting decision that left me puzzled is Whoopi Goldberg, who is probably the last person on earth I would have picked to play Detective Candy Bliss, but oh well.\n\nBottom line: This is a good, solid film. Not great, but very good. The story is about as unrealistic as you can get and I think the ending is way too optimistic, but stranger things have been known to happen in this world.","summary":"A decent adaptation of an okay book","unixReviewTime":1192752000,"vote":null,"image":null}

I've been taking advantage of the VHS sales in local video stores for quite a while now.  Many of them are dirt cheap, and if you still have a functional VCR and don't demand all the \"extras\" of the DVD format, you can find all kinds of bargains.\n\nAnd all kinds of dross too, unfortunately.  I purchased this movie recently, along with several other films starring Michelle Pfeiffer and was contemplating holding my own personal \"Pfeiffer Film Festival,\" but for better or for worse, I started out with DEEP END OF THE OCEAN and that pretty much nipped those plans in the bud.  I wound up shelving the other entries in the Pfeiffer filmography for another rainy day.  This one was just too depressing.  And I don't mean the content.\n\nI think most people recognize that Michelle Pfeiffer is a talented actress as well as being a very beautiful woman.  But like many good actresses, she seems to wind up in mediocre film after mediocre film.  Maybe it was ever thus.  How many truly great films did a Katharine Hepburn or a Bette Davis really do in their day.  And Liz Taylor did clunker after clunker in the late 60s and early 70s.  But there was a significant change in recent decades.  Even our biggest stars of today don't carry films the way they once did.  No one goes to see a Michelle Pfeiffer film just because Michelle Pfeiffer is in it these days.  The pressure is on, then, for an actor to pick vehicles worthy of his or her talents.\n\nA number of the reviews I've seen posted here and elsewhere have elaborated on THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN's storyline, so I won't belabor that here.  Suffice to say that the story of a child's kidnapping and the subsequent emotional trauma it inflicts on an entire family is a potentially powerful one.  Pfeiffer heads a strong cast, including Treat Williams as her equally grieving but more resilient husband.  They all have good moments and make the most of their screentime, but the story never quite gels.  And it doesn't get much better when after ten years, the family is abruptly reunited with their lost son.\n\nThe fact that the reunion is highly unlikely is not so much the problem.  I'm not out to revoke anyone's dramatic license here.  What makes no dramatic sense or even common sense is the family's handling of the situation.  In the Age of Oprah, how come no one even considers any kind of counseling for ANYONE in the family.  Many people (and many entire families, of course) are resistant to seeking psychological help, but under such extraordinary circumstances, it's hard to imagine this family not even considering the option.  If not for themselves, how about for the boy?  After all he's been through, even the proudest of families should feel little compunction about his receiving professional help.\n\nLike many other reviewers who have not read Jacquelyn Michaud's acclaimed novel upon which this film is based, I am guessing that this is likely one more case in which the \"book was better.\"  A novel, of course, can indulge in more leisurely pacing, and provide more background and, most importantly, can utilize techniques like interior monologue which contemporary cinema rightly eschews.  (Voiceovers don't cut it--and never did).  I wonder too if the book might not have provided us with some kind of explanation for the evocative title.  There seems to be a trend toward a kind of emotional topography in recent fiction and cinema (not only \"deep ends of the ocean\" but also \"maps of the world\" and of \"the human heart\").  Apparently, they mean something.  The book may make it clear.  The movie doesn't really bother.","summary":"So Much For My \"Pfeiffer Festival\"","unixReviewTime":1127520000,"vote":7.0,"image":null}

It really shows how it only takes a minute for a child to be kidnapped and his family to be permanently affected because of it. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as Beth Cappadora, the loving but somewhat ditzy young mother who takes her two small sons and her infant daughter with her to a high school reunion at a hotel. There, Beth makes perhaps the biggest mistake of her life when she leaves the two boys alone right smack in the middle of a very crowded lobby while she pays at the front desk. As can only be expected when two young children are left unsupervised, something happens. The younger son--3-year-old Ben--disappears and is not found. After a series of breakdowns and withdrawals, Beth is finally able to start putting her life back together with the help of Pat, her extremely loving and supportive husband. Just when things are finally getting better for Beth and her family, a 12-year-old Ben randomly shows up at the Cappadoras' doorstep, so beginning another long period of confusion, fear, discomfort, and pain for everyone involved. It really is a very moving film; much like \"The Face on the Milk Carton,\" but with a very different conclusion. \"The Deep End of The Ocean\" really grasps the issues of child abduction, the effects that it has on the other children in the family, and everything a mother goes through when she realizes that her child is lost and may never be seen again. I was personally touched by Jonathan Jackson's character--Vincent, the oldest Cappadora son. Only seven years old at the beginning of the movie, he ends up holding his family together when Ben disappears, and he is clearly overlooked throughout it all. Obviously, this plays a big part in the behavioral issues and problems that Vincent develops as he grows older. The character he plays is very realistic, and you come to understand how much he truly was overshadowed when Ben disappeared and how much he needs to know that his parents still love him and have forgiven him for what happened. (I won't say what he needs forgiveness for, but it all ties together in the movie.) Treat Williams was masterful as the loving husband. To me, he was the strongest part of the movie. He loved his wife unconditionally, he was a very caring father, and all he wanted was to help make his family whole again. Although he is sometimes a little unrealistic through his opinion that everything will fall right into place, it is very nice to know that there is a character in the movie with a very optimistic viewpoint and a belief that things will be all right in the end.\nThis is a movie that may move you to tears and may disturb you at some parts, but it is definitely worth seeing. The plot and the characters are presented in such a way that you can really see, know, and understand the ordinary life that they are forced to leave behind and the family issues which they don't choose but must take. Recommended viewing...very effective and poignant with a very strong message.","summary":"moving, emotional, incredible movie","unixReviewTime":1025308800,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

I felt that the movie was supposed to have been very compelling on an emotional, almost primal, level, but it was not compelling at all. I imagine that the book did a better job of conveying the terror of losing your child and realizing that your child may be gone forever. The people in the film all seemed to be too obsessed with themselves. Naturally this kind of tragedy will cause introspection and times of real doubt and soul searching, but I did not get the sense that the people here had any level of depth or sincerity.","summary":"CHARACTER FLAWS FLAW FILM","unixReviewTime":985564800,"vote":10.0,"image":null}

Litton","reviewText":"\"The Deep End of the Ocean\" is one of the best movies of 1999, complex and moving, with truly emotional characters played by actors who carry the weight of the story on their shoulders with incredible ease and make it heartwarming and believable. The movie is actually two different stories, one being a family's emotional coming-to-terms with a missing child, and then the pain and stress they must endure when he shows up nine years later.\nOn her way to her high school reunion, Beth Cappadora is told by her husband that if her head wasn't attached to her, she would lose it quickly. This provides a short laugh, while also setting up what is to come. At the reunion, she leaves her three-year-old son Ben in the care of his older brother Vincent, only to come back moments later and realize that he is gone. Hysterics grow, and after a thorough search of the building, he is nowhere to be found. Surrounded by family and friends, Beth begins to cope with her mistake as the community gets involved in the search for Ben, without success. Resigned to the fact that he will never be found, she returns home, and while the first steps to coping with what has happened are rocky, the family seems to be getting along well after the passage of nine years. They have moved to a new house in a new town, her husband has the restaurant he always wanted... A knock on the door turns everything upside down. Beth immediately recognizes the boy as her son, and is relieved and confused that he lives only two blocks away from their new residence. The authorities get involved, and soon Ben is taken from the only home he can remember and placed in a new and somewhat emotionally frightening setting where he is called by a name he does not know and lives with people he does not remember or feel much for.\nWhat makes this movie work for me is the complexity of the story as well as the characters, and the magnificence in which the two blend together. The first part of the story admittedly is the more believable of the two, diving into the emotions of the family as they must cope with the grief of the missing Ben. Beth's reaction to her son's disappearance is superbly acted out by Michelle Pheiffer, who carries it like she's been through it in reality. The first half of the movie shows her dealing with the pain in the only way she knows how: shutting everyone else out, ignoring the optimism of life that is to be explored. This causes her to become somewhat distanced from her husband, played by Treat Williams, and her oldest son, who feels the great weight of responsibility set in when he must take care of his little sister while his parents argue.\nThe second half of the movie is the more emotional of the two, however, as the family, who is just beginning to enjoy life, find their son and bring him back home. There is an unmistakable truth in what occurs emotionally between the two brothers, Vincent and Ben, who goes by Sam. Vincent, who has just begun to gain the attention he never got from his parents, feels threatened by the presence of Ben, and does everything he can to make his long-lost sibling feel unwelcome. This, accompanied by the emotional baggage toted by the family in their struggle to be happy together all conspire to make the movie more heartfelt, warming and true.\nSome of the best acting talent ever has gone into the making of this movie, which is heavily called for considering the amount of emotion that needs to be conveyed to the audience. Michelle Pheiffer is Beth Cappadora, and in this role, she is literally required to become her character. She does this with superb talent, playing Beth as an overall emotional person with a strong will hidden beneath her sorrows. Treat Williams makes the perfect supportive husband, as well as a father who just wants things to be like he always imagined for his family. Ben's return has a big effect on him, and when he puts his foot down about what the family does together, the acting is nothing short of amazing. Jackson does a great job in playing the older brother Vincent, as well as the wild-child teenager who gets into a lot of trouble. Whoopi Goldberg seems like a stretch as the detective working the case, but she works the camera as well with her serious demeanor.\nComplexity and integrity are what make a movie worth watching, and \"The Deep End of the Ocean\" has all of this and more. The fact that the plot is basically two parts should not be a deference from the film; believe me, the story rolls right along. Dynamic performances and highly likeable characters also add to the film's appeal. What more can you ask for?","summary":"A heartwarming movie!","unixReviewTime":980294400,"vote":19.0,"image":null}

Treat Williams gives a credible performance as her bewildered husband and Jonathan Jackson who plays Vincent, the Cappadora's oldest son at 16, is quietly believeable as a boy with a troubled conscience.

For some reason, she brings all her kids and leaves her husband  behind.  However, a tragedy strikes when she leaves the older boy (Vincent)  to watch the younger one (Ben) and he goes missing.  He goes missing for 10  years.\nMuch of the movie involves the consequences of such an action  immediately after the abduction as well as the scars that it leaves even 10  years later.  Vincent, who is not like 17, has become a hardened teen,  partly because of his guilt for letting Ben go and partly because his  mother stopped doing her job as a parent for so many years.  The  wife\/husband relationship is also strained but is on the mend as Ben (now  called Sam) comes back into their lives.\nHowever, Ben\/Sam is not happy  to be back.

The Cappadora who raised him to age 3 and are the biological  parents or George Karras who raised Ben\/Sam for the remaining 10 years and  is the only parent that Ben\/Sam ever knew?\nWell these questions are not  really answered in this melodrama because Ben\/Sam becomes less the focus of  the story.  Actually the director goes all over the place patching up story  leaks with quaint little fixes that are reminiscent of Sit coms.

Zwick","reviewText":"Like far too many films these days, \"The Deep End of the Ocean\" begins promisingly then collapses midway under the crushing weight of heavyhanded plot mechanics, incredibility and sentimentality. The premise  of the story is so compelling that the audience can't help but be drawn  emotionally into the intense plight facing this family.\nMichelle  Pfeiffer portrays a young photographer, living an idyllic life in Madison,  Wisconsin with a loving and devoted husband (Treat Williams) and three  adorable young children. While in Chicago for a class reunion, every  parent's ultimate nightmare becomes a reality: her middle child  unaccountably disappears in the middle of a crowded hotel lobby. These  scenes, in which she undergoes a sense of mounting panic as well as a  crushing sense of guilt and personal self-doubt, are more terrifying than  anything contained in a conventional \"horror\" film. We cringe too  as the investigators come up against one blank wall after another,  empathizing fully with a mother driven to desperation in the face of the  unspeakable.\nAs months pass, the family attempts to cope with the  horrific reality of their situation and the film promises to become an  insightful study of the effects of the loss, fear and guilt that  accompanies the disappearance of a child. But then the film goes agley as  it moves ahead a decade and the child is miraculously discovered living a  mere few blocks away, happily ensconced with a man first thought to be a  kidnapper then revealed as an innocent pawn in an abduction scheme gone  awry. As the child moves in with his \"true\" parents, the  screenplay settles into a bland T.V. movie formula, in which each character  must act out his or her customary little drama with little heed given to  believability or originality. Instead of exploring the various stages a  family goes through in the wake of a devastating loss, the film cheats us  by coming through with an unconvincingly upbeat resolution. It becomes  quite clear that the filmmakers are far more concerned with jerking out  tears than with providing a truly thoughtprovoking exploration of its  theme. This is a shame because the actors (especially Pfeiffer) handle  their roles admirably. Only Whoopi Goldberg, in a totally thankless role as  a compassionate investigator of missing children, seems hopelessly miscast.  This film might well have been a labor of love for her (and indeed for  everyone involved), but for the audience, it only makes one sigh over how  much better it might have been.","summary":"film with potential falls apart","unixReviewTime":964396800,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

By this time, I was very sad as I just wanted it  to come together nicely for the family. For awhile the movie seeed to drag,  but it was still watchable.  Fine performances from Treat Williams as the  father who expects everything to fall into place, and as mentioned above, a  great performance from Michelle Pfeiffer as the mother who has to endure so  much pain. I agree with others, it seems like a telemovie only because many  telemovies focus on similar family themes. The movie will promise you this  though: in the blink of an eye, your whole life can change.","summary":"Seemed long ... but still worthwhile","unixReviewTime":958867200,"vote":null,"image":null}

It may have been because my expectation were for a shoot-'em up action flick, and as the film played out, I realized it was a comedy taking jabs at what was then my teenage self's favorite genre, I was irritated. More likely, it was because my brother and I went to see this at it's Midnight opening, and I was simply tired and cranky by the time the film started playing?! Either way, it wasn't a movie I revisited for quite some time. Flash ahead a few years, and I see it on the shelf at Blockbuster (remember those?...there's one in this movie even!) and decide to give it another viewing. Upon second viewing, I enjoyed the movie much more, and now it stands right up there with some of Schwarzenegger's best films.\n\nThe basic story is that a young boy is given a magic ticket, the ticket allows the boy to enter the latest film of his favorite action star Jack Slater. While helping Jack thwart crime in LA, he's also trying to convince Slater that they are both in a movie by pointing out things like one cop being an animated cat, or guns that never run out of bullets. Slater doesn't buy it, but when an evil henchman steals the ticket to come into the real world, it's up to Slater to stop him and get the ticket back.\n\nFull of lots of inside jokes, a great soundtrack, and some pretty fun action sequences, a ton of cameos, \"Last Action Hero\" has a bit of something for everyone. Definitely worth revisiting.","summary":"Worth a Re-Visit","unixReviewTime":1441929600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Maybe not. Although it uses familiar action movie tropes in a satire-like way, I think if none if it is noticed, letting it be more \"wink-wink\" fun than a more serious statement (about how unrealistic movies are), it a great movie.\n\nSure, there are plenty of action movie cliches, like guns which never require reloading, heroes who are never seriously hurt, and characters who can do amazing physical things. And every bad line you can get into a movie is here. But it works.\n\nThe short synopsis:\nBoy gets magic movie ticket and is unexpectedly pulled into a movie something like a modern Dirty Harry, landing in the car of the hero (Arnold). He knows parts of the plot other characters do not because he saw the first 10 minutes in third person objective. The movie characters believe they are real, but the boy knows otherwise. Eventually, the good and bad guys arrive in the real world.\n\nSo much of it is intentionally predictable. You don't mind. Arnold pokes fun at himself and other stars of the genre, drawing from plenty of cheesy motifs, puns and plot lines.\n\nIt is an older movie, but hasn't aged a bit. I fully recommend, \"Last Action Hero.\"\n\nAnthony Trendl\nanthonytrendl.com","summary":"Remarkable, Fun Satire","unixReviewTime":1432166400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Perhaps because it didn't take itself seriously - it is, after all, an Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie mocking Arnold Schwarzenegger action movies - so maybe we feel like we shouldn't take it seriously either.\n\nArnold by this time had well established himself as an action hero, indeed THE action hero to many.  But he had also starred in several successful comedies, such as Twins and Kindergarten Cop.  And while there is plenty of action in this movie, it is more a comedy than an action movie.  It is surprisingly (and refreshingly) self-aware in its analysis of the fictional reflection of our real world that exists only in the movies - sort of a modern-day Alice Through the Looking Glass.  Whether mocking that there are no ordinary-looking women in the movies, only gorgeous models; or the impossibility that all phone numbers begin with \"555\", this movie asks us to examine the holes in the fictional reality we are fed in the movie theater, rather than overlook them.  It is not often that we get a refreshingly honest script as this.\n\nUnfortunately, this Blu-ray presentation leaves something to be desired.  The transfer is a bit soft, with weak blacks, and even some fuzzy blurring to the edge of the image in at least one scene (the last projection booth scene).  There are ZERO extras, (not even a trailer), and the menu consists of one choice - \"Play Movie\".  No soundtrack or subtitle options.  Obviously Columbia has not shown the love to this movie.  So, much as I regret it, this Blu-ray only gets 3 stars, due to the quality of the transfer.  However, don't let that dissuade you.  This really is a gem of a movie.","summary":"Blurring the line","unixReviewTime":1417132800,"vote":13.0,"image":null}

This is mostly because Columbia's DVD is in full screen, which makes it undesirable. Mill Creek's DVD is in widescreen, the transfer is good, and the artwork is the original artwork (Columbia's wasn't). The only draw is the the DVD is even more bare-bones than Columbia, a fact I didn't think was possible. The menu has nothing but a play option.

Studio bosses at Columbia Pictures were convinced that Arnold Schwarzenegger would clobber the dinosaurs, and played up this battle of the box office behemoths in their promotion for the film. They were gravely mistaken. Arnold Schwarzenegger got stomped like Bambi under Godzilla's foot. I can recall going to a big multiplex with Steven Spielberg's film on five screens. Even in its second week, lines to see it went through the theatre lobby and out the door. In comparison, 'Last Action Hero' opened there on just a single screen with a half-empty auditorium. After a string of mega-hits including 'Total Recall' and 'Terminator 2,' the actor had his first outright flop. As a potential contender for the big summer blockbuster of the year, 'Last Action Hero' was simply not to be.\n\nIn hindsight, there was simply no way that any picture in its position could have ever succeeded. Not even the biggest film star in the world, which Arnold Schwarzenegger was at the time, could face off against the defining cultural moment for a generation of moviegoers and survive unscathed. However, bad timing was certainly not the film's only problem. Even if not for its box office competition, the movie's poor screenplay, inconsistent tone, and the irritating performance from one of its lead stars would have likely done it in anyway.\n\nSomewhere during its development, 'Last Action Hero' started off as a [supposedly] clever idea, even metaphysical, high-concept pitch. The story works as a sort of reverse spin on Woody Allen's 'The Purple Rose of Cairo.' Life in the big city slums of New York hasn't been easy for young Danny Madigan [Austin O'Brien]. In between home invasions and muggings, the boy's only form of entertainment is to watch films at the run-down old theatre where he's befriended the doddering projectionist Nick [Robert Prosky] who owns his personal Cinema. Like most 12 year-olds, he has an enthusiasm for films but hasn't yet developed taste in them. His favourites are the mindless shoot-'em-ups starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, yes, the actor name-checks himself, as loose cannon cop Jack Slater. After one particularly bad day, his projectionist friend offers Danny Madigan a special advance screening of 'Jack Slater IV', all by himself at midnight. The boy jumps at the chance. When he arrives, he's also given a magic ticket said to be passed down from Harry Houdini. Danny Madigan is in hog heaven as he settles down to watch Jack Slater take revenge on the Mafioso, who killed his second-cousin.\n\nWell, it turns out that the magic ticket really is magical. At a key moment, Danny Madigan is sucked into the theatre screen and passes right through into the world of the film itself. Against his disbelief, he's living in his favourite film, paired up as Jack Slater's newest partner. His attempts to explain the predicament to anyone and everyone in earshot are met with indifference. Now, Danny Madigan must find a way to get back to the real world. In the process, he'll have to help Jack Slater foil the Mob's latest scheme to take over Los Angeles.\n\nIt's [supposedly] a neat idea, and 'Last Action Hero' has a handful of funny scenes to support it. Early on, bored at school, Danny Madigan fantasises about Arnold Schwarzenegger taking over for Laurence Olivier in 'Hamlet' and blowing the hell out of Denmark. In Jack Slater's crazy celluloid universe, the L.A.P.D. is populated by all sorts of wacko cops in outlandish uniforms. Blink-and-you'll-miss-'em celebrity cameos pop up all over, like Sharon Stone as Catherine Trammel, Robert Patrick as the T-1000, and Danny DeVito as the voice of an animated cat detective, to name but a few. The film takes pot-shots at action film clichs like the crusty police captain, the hero's bad puns, the overly-talky killer, the cop killed with only two days to retirement, a chase through the oft-used L.A. River, and many ridiculous stunts and explosions. Arnold Schwarzenegger is plenty game to send-up his own persona and career. And the meta-filmic twists go into overdrive when the main villain Benedict [Charles Dance] who is delightfully creepy, escapes into the real world with a plot to disrupt the 'Jack Slater IV' premiere and kill the true Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nTowards the end of the film, Arnold Schwarzenegger appears as himself, attending the New York opening of his latest Jack Slater film, accompanied by his wife, Maria Shriver, and blithely unaware that Jack Slater is fighting for his life in another part of the theatre. Instead, Arnold Schwarzenegger is seen hustling the Jack Slater merchandise that, like the \"Last Action Hero\" T-shirts, caps and poster are being sold to promote the film.\n\nUnfortunately, these things take up maybe 15 to 20 minutes of screen time in a 131-minute film. Whatever good ideas the original script may have held were eventually watered down through countless rewrites, studio interference, test screening feedback, and last-minute reshoots. Danny Madigan is an incredibly whiny and annoying lead character that engenders no audience sympathy at all. I can't blame poor Austin O'Brien too much; I'm sure the kid did exactly what everyone asked of him. The hiring of John McTiernan as the director, especially where he made his mark with 'Predator' and 'Die Hard,' also turned out to be a much bigger mistake than anyone realised. The director may be deft with the action stuff, but has no sense of comedy whatsoever. Far too many of the gags in the film are thudding unfunny. For long stretches of the film, everyone seems to forget that they're making a spoof of dumb action films, and instead just proceeds to make a dumb action film.\n\n'Last Action Hero' is slightly overlong, and not nearly as funny, smart, or entertaining as it thinks it is. Sadly, everyone realised it. At $85 million, the film was quite expensive for its day and it cost more than 'Jurassic Park' did, and yet grossed a paltry $50 million domestically. It did better overseas, and I'm sure turned a profit eventually. But the vanity project is still remembered as a black mark in its star's career. On the other hand, 'Last Action Hero' is not quite the worthless disaster that it was made out to be at the time either. If you can go into it with low expectations, the picture is just moderately clever enough to be watchable. Just barely, though and set those expectations really low.\n\nWith his lantern jaw and square-cut, comic-book looks, Arnold Schwarzenegger handles his various roles with good humour: it is fun being the boss. Young Austin O'Brien is also a very slick performer. Note should be made of the contributions of Dean Semler, the director of photography; Eugenio Zanetti, the production designer, and Richard Greenberg, the visual effects consultant.\n\nBlu-ray Video Quality  Considering its history on the very inferior DVD, 'Last Action Hero' looks surprisingly respectable on Blu-ray. The 1080p transfer is presented in the films correct 2.40:1 theatrical aspect ratio. The image is at least reasonably sharp enough that the small engraving on Arnold's belt buckle is legible. Black levels are solid and the contrast range appears to be properly rendered without artificial boosting. Colours are well saturated and sometimes striking. In another pleasant surprise, I didn't spot any edge enhancement artefacts. My initial expectation was that Sony would merely recycle their DVD master from 2001, and the studio's DVDs of the era were almost all plagued with edge ringing problems. Countering that, however, is some moderate but noticeable Digital Noise Reduction filtering that does give the transfer a dated appearance. This causes occasional smearing during motion, and frozen grain patterns. Grain representation in general is a problem with the disc. The movie's photography is fairly grainy in spots, especially during special effects shots. The high-definition transfer doesn't handle the grain very well. It looks very noisy and even blocky at times, which suggests either poor digitalisation during the telecine transfer or poor compression during the disc encoding.\n\nBlu-ray Audio Quality  In similar respects, the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack is decent all around, but not quite exceptional. 'Last Action Hero' had the distinction of being the first movie released theatrically in the SDDS 7.1 audio format, Sony's competition for Dolby Digital and DTS. The latter debuted a week earlier with 'Jurassic Park' and stole most of Sony's thunder. Many of the theatres equipped with SDDS experienced technical problems; for several years, and the format was referred to as a complete failure. In order to show off their 7.1 channels, the film's mixers loaded up the soundtrack with lots of zinging directional and surround activity. Bullets whiz all through the soundstage repeatedly. Even as mixed down to 5.1 channels here, the track is still very aggressive. It also matrixes well into 7.1 configuration with Dolby ProLogic IIx processing. Overall fidelity is pretty good. The rockin' score and songs on the soundtrack are satisfyingly broad across the front channels. Sound effects such as knives are quite sharp and piercing. Gun fire has a nice kick. Dynamic range is a little on the shallow side. The movie has plenty of explosions, but few of them dig particularly deep. In baseball terms, this would be a solid double.\n\nBlu-ray Special Features and Extras: Just like earlier DVD editions of this film, the Blu-ray has no bonus features. Unless you count a bunch of trailers that are not very relevant, which is to my mind, a complete waste of a Blu-ray disc.\n\nFinally, film for film and despite a couple of misfires in an otherwise exemplary rsum, there was at one point nobody better in the Action movie business than John McTiernan, and after a string of cranking out three of the most successful Action films of all time, the Director proved himself abundantly capable of delivering what was and still arguably is the quintessential Action spoof film in Last Action Hero. Starring history's biggest Action hero and delivering a fun and magical plot that perfectly intermixes general parody of the Action movie business, Last Action Hero makes for an infinitely re-watchable picture for Action and Arnold Schwarzenegger fans alike. Sony's Blu-ray release, however, is rather tepid, featuring a fairly decent 1080p picture quality, a booming lossless soundtrack, and next to no extras. Recommended for diehard fans of the film, but for more casual viewers should wait for, hopefully a special edition at some point in the future will be released, I hope so. Despite it being slightly a disappointing film, that should have been better, I am still glad I have got this in my Blu-ray Collection, as I am really keen to build up an extensive Arnold Schwarzenegger Blu-ray Collection.\n\nAndrew C.

Right from the start, I wish that there had been more of Danny Devito as the cartoon cat, but that may just be because I'm a Danny Devito fan...Arnold just doesn't do it for me.  The ridiculous nature of the \"action movie\" was quite enjoyable (sadly, action movies in our world aren't that far off) and the villain, played by Charles Dance, didn't quite stray into an area that I like to refer to as \"stereotypical creepy\".  I enjoyed the satirical elements of this film, though I stop and wonder how the makers of real action films come up with some of their stuff.  I mean, I thought all the satire was right on the money, so have action movies really strayed so much?  Anyway, I found the leading lad, Austin O'Brien, okay, though he seemed to stray from whining to annoyingly over-confident the whole time, neither of which are appealing traits for me.  I actually found Robert Prosky as the theatre attendant more interesting...Danny Devito still wins though.  Overall, this was the perfect film for Arnold Schwarzenegger as it basically poked fun at what he did best while allowing him to continue doing it.

Full of explosions, cheesy one liners, and over the top characterizations, this genre was just BEGGING for a parody. While \"Hot Shots! Part Deux\" did an admirable job, Last Action Hero is the absolute \"last word\" on the subject of \"action movie parodies\" as it takes an already takes an established \"beefcake\" action star like good ol' Arnie and thrusts him into the spotlight as the mega-hit cop hero, Jack Slater.\n\nThe film centers around a delinquent kid named Danny who skips school constantly so he can watch movies (namely Jack Slater Films) in a rundown theater run by a kindly old man. The old timer offers to show Danny an advance screening of the latest Jack Slater film provided he attends school. And he does so after being mugged in his own home and having day dreams of Arnold (who also plays himself along with Jack Slater) starring in a much more action oriented version of the film adaptation of Hamlet during class. When Danny arrives at the cineplex, he's given a magical ticket by the old man who says that it was given to him by Harry Houdini. Later on, while Danny is enjoying the movie, the ticket sparkles and he's instantly thrust into the celluloid world of Jack Slater who's hot on the case of Tony Vivaldi. And jesus, this film plays \"homage\" to so many action film tropes that it is quite honestly INSANE. Cops dying three days before retirement, the henchmen double crossing his incompetent boss. the hero getting his badge revoked during an important case, etc, etc, etc\n\nThe tropes are openly mocked as well as celebrated and I feel is the biggest underlying theme of this movie: the celebration, not mockery, of action movies. And what's strange is how many people see Arnold's other film \"Commando\" (1985) as a parody movie (namely Doug Walker, alias \"The Nostalgia Critic\") and view \"Last Action Hero\" as some shlocky mess of a film that can only be laughed at \"ironically\".\n\nBottom line: If you like Action Movies and a good bit of satire, get Last Action Hero","summary":"The Parody To End All Parodies","unixReviewTime":1395878400,"vote":null,"image":null}

I'm one of this film's loyal fans.\n\nAt the time it was making the theatrical rounds I worked at Sears Brand Central in their electronics division. We had a dedicated laser disc player that repeated every 30 minutes a selection of movie promos, plus Sears and other commercials. These discs were changed monthly.\n\nFor a couple of cycles, \"Last Action Hero\" was a featured item. The ad included some fine concert footage of AC\/DC's \"Big Gun.\" A portion of this track opens the picture's final credit scroll. Arnold appears in character during the Sears video while Angus Young does his famous schoolboy prance on stage.\n\nThe soundtrack of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/LAST-ACTION-HERO\/dp\/B00000297D\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">LAST ACTION HERO<\/a>&nbsp;is a metal or rocker fan's delight. It includes cuts by Alice in Chains, Megadeath, Fishbone, Def Leppard, Anthrax, Cypress Hill, Queensryche and Aerosmith. Tesla has the title track.\n\nThe reason I'm particularly fond of this one is its references to classic movies, including Hamlet, in a fab b&w scene where Arnold as a grungy machine gun packing Dane says, \"To be or not to be\" and lights a bomb off his stogie. He tosses the TNT. Big explosion behind him and then a drolly given, \"Not to be\" ends the sequence.\n\nBest of all is Ian McKellen's take on the Grim Reaper from Ingmar Bergman's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/THE-SEVENTH-SEAL\/dp\/B001WLMOL4\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">THE SEVENTH SEAL<\/a>&nbsp;(1957). Honorable mention to Tom Noonan's horribly scarred axe-wielding villain. He and Arnold play dual roles: themselves the actors and their action film characters.\n\nIt's a great concept: young Austin O'Brien (as Danny Madigan) steps into a movie and then he and other fictional characters cross back into the real world. That L.A. police station on the other side of the screen is great. We also get a holographic glimpse here of Arnold's Terminator foe in cop drag, and Danny DeVito provides the voice of 'Whiskers,' a cartoon cat detective. Also here, Austin\/Danny I.D.s a confused F. Murray Abraham as Mozart's killer (remember&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/AMADEUS\/dp\/B00006DEFA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">AMADEUS<\/a>?).\n\nAt the video store, Sylvester Stallone is seen on a lifesize cardboard stand up display as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/THE-TERMINATOR\/dp\/B00005N5S5\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">THE TERMINATOR<\/a>. Jack Slater (Arnold) raves about how good Sly is in the role to a shocked Danny. It's too funny!

Here's a thing to keep in mind though: this is actually a PARODY of the action genre that just happens to have Arnold Schwarzenegger in it. It's not trying to be a replica of the big names such as Terminator, Predator, or even Commando (which was unintentionally hilarious, by the way). Instead, it's an inside joke in the style of a sketch comedy skit, except it's drawn out much longer. While I personally don't think that Last Action Hero is terrible by any means, it doesn't mean that's it flawless.\n\nArnold manages to play two characters in this film: the far more present cinematic world character Jack Slater, and the real life version of himself. He is obviously the reason why you would want to see this movie, and throughout the film, he makes fun of his stereotypical character by using over-the-top one liners and using unorthodox methods of action scenes. There's some hilarious jokes that he says throughout, and along with him, we even manage to see other film icons playing some of their trademark parts, including Robert Patrick dressed up as the T-1000, Sharon Stone's role as Catherine Tramell, and one of my personal favorites, Sylvester Stallone as The Terminator on a cardboard cutout. While I do enjoy the comedic, over-the-top bits that obviously point out the Hollywood cliches, this film suffers from drawing these out too long amongst its script. Sometimes they tend to be unnecessary and at others rather boring.\n\nAlso, I found the child protagonist played by Austin O'Brien to be rather annoying. Part of me thinks that they used the idea of him teaming up with Schwarzy from T2, where Edward Furlong was the child protagonist. While Furlong was clever, funny and acted well, O'Brien tries too hard to be a mastermind behind the typical action film. I understand that the role of a child was necessary for this to work, seeing how he managed to magically appear in the movie with his favorite action hero, but it could have been done far better with someone that could pull it off in a far less annoying fashion.\n\nIn a way, I tend to find Last Action Hero to be an enjoyable popcorn flick that tried something new by being a hidden parody. It was a major risk for director John McTiernan, screenwriter Shane Black (who ironically rewrote the script despite Zak Penn and Adam Leff having it a tongue-in-cheek reference to Black's style), and Arnold, but as a parody, it works. It's just a far cry from what we would expect from a cast like aforementioned.","summary":"Arnold pokes fun at himself","unixReviewTime":1307232000,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

Audiences don't like smart movies. Or perhaps I should say audiences don't like to be OUTSMARTED by movies. In the summer of 1993 the world was going crazy for a certain dinosaur movie, almost everything else didn't stand a chance. LAH came out a week after Jurassic Park. The only people who really went to see it were those who were too late for sold-out screenings of Spielberg's movie. Bad word of mouth spread for many reasons.\n\nThose lucky enough to actually see it on the big screen walked away confused and disorientated. They thought they were in for a straight-up action movie, not an existential, meta-fictional parody of the genre they cherish. It was just too much and they weren't ready for it. Arnold had been riding the wave of Total Recall and Terminator 2 before the release of Last Action Hero, no one expected such a radical deviation from the norm.\n\nDanny Madigan is a lonely kid living in a tiny New York apartment with his single MILF. His only friend is Nick, an old-time projectionist at a run down theater (a REAL theater, no multiplex nonsense). Danny likes to escape into the world of action movies, his biggest hero, obviously, being Arnie himself. The latest Arnie blockbuster, the simply-titled Jack Slater IV, is a day away from its premiere, and old Nick has been tasked with checking the print. Before Danny sits down for his own personal pre-premiere midnight screening Nick gives him a magical ticket he's been saving since childhood. Five minutes after Jack Slater IV begins Danny is warped into the cinema screen and becomes part of the movie.\n\nIn the movie world Danny quickly learns that the laws of physics and simple logic don't apply (how often has THAT proven to be true?). He's partnered with Slater, a renegade L.A. cop and the absolute zenith of action hero stereotypes, to find who killed his favorite second-cousin Frank (BIG MISTAKE!). Danny and Slater smash their way into a hokey, James Bond-ish plot, though it's not long before suave English henchman Mr. Benedict discovers Danny's secret and plans to escape to the real world. Danny and Slater follow, but Slater's movie-world abilities are rendered useless in reality. Doubt begins seep in for the first time as he ends up questioning his powers as a good cop.\n\nLast Action Hero scores huge points all round. It's technically wonderful, with gorgeous anamorphic Panavision photography full of wide angles and lens flares. The writing is sharp is funny. Arnie is great as an infallible hero in crisis as well as making fun of his screen persona. And the action, both fictional and meta-fictional, is wild, overblown, and exciting. I just love Slater's huge fall from the elevator.\n\nIt's interesting to note that it has a lot in common with Loaded Weapon, which came out earlier that year. Both are send-ups of the 'L.A. cop movie' genre, both star F. Murray Abraham in supporting roles. Both feature Frank McRae as a screaming Lieutenant. Both have obvious Die Hard references (also directed by the infamous John McTiernan).\n\nThe bad reputation is unjustified. The financial loss was a mistake entirely on Sony's part and their lack of foresight into the 1993 summer season. Last Action Hero and Jurassic Park went head-to-head with their advertising but the dinosaur movie's marketing campaign was just too groundbreaking. They also competed with each other on a technical level. JP was the first film to feature DTS sound, while Last Action Hero was the first to feature SDDS (Sony Dynamic Digital Sound), an eight-channel system that delivers every decibel of Slater's big gun and the multiple explosions of his daily life.\n\nIt may be a satire, but Last Action Hero just may be one of the last true action films. Real stunts, real explosions, real destruction, reality gone twisted. It's Arnold's most subversive movie, and it's many things, but bad ain't one of them.\n\nThe Blu Ray features a great 2.35:1 1080p picture with a loud DTS HD-MA soundtrack. Zero extras are included. Sony seems to still be ashamed of the film. The hate is not deserved.","summary":"An intelligent, under-rated and over-looked satire","unixReviewTime":1296432000,"vote":83.0,"image":null}

John McTiernan's 1993 LAST ACTION HERO was roundly criticized at the time of its release for being overblown and not delivering the goods that were expected from a $70-90 million (a lot of money at the time) film.  It came in the wake of TERMINATOR II, a hard act to follow certainly, and also just after McTiernan's financially disappointing MEDICINE MAN - but with his big hit THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER still reasonably fresh.  More importantly, the director had gotten his big break with PREDATOR, which was an important step in Arnold's rise to superstardom; this was their first (and to date only) reteaming.  I suppose expectations were higher than any film could deliver, and when the film failed to ignite either critics or the box office (to be fair, it was always in the mighty shadow of JURASSIC PARK), the word \"flop\" started to get bandied about, and the cynics started to wonder of the star's decade of dominance was coming to an end.\n\nThe naysayers were partly right; this was the first sign of Arnold faltering, though it would take another five years before he really started to lose his lustre; and it wasn't his best film by a long shot, though it certainly looks pretty good now in comparison with some of his later, even more expensive and less successful outings like END OF DAYS.  Basically the idea here is that we start off watching \"Jack Slater III\", an Arnold Schwarzenegger cop film in a sort of alternate reality that's pretty close to ours, and then our eventual sidekick character, an adolescent kid named Danny (Austin O'Brien) is revealed as watching the flick in a crumbling and decrepit old NYC movie palace.  The early scenes here are very evocative - Danny is watching the film alone, friends with the old projectionist Nick (Robert Prosky), and his mother (Mercedes Ruehl) worries about him skipping school and only being interested in movies and hanging out with the weird old guy.  Very Zemeckis-Spielberg.  But soon we're in different territory as Nick gives Danny a \"magic ticket\" that he got from Houdini himself, tearing it and releasing the magic that allows Danny to be catapulted into the movie world of Jack Slater (now starring in the 4th installment of the franchise, brand-new and not even officially premiered yet).\n\nSo the \"real world\" kid falls in with the completely fake Slater, who is of course unaware that he's a movie character.  There are some pretty good jokes early on - Slater's boss, the blustery Lt Dekker (Frank McRae) gets so angry and abusive if his regular berating of Slater that he becomes completely incomprehensible; Slater never runs out of bullets and never hurts himself; there are cameos from several costars of Arnold's from previous films; cartoon characters work as cops; etc.  But the satire on action movie conventions is fitful and often seems to be used just to fill in the blanks between \"real\" action sequences, and the developing friendship between Danny and Jack, while sweet, just doesn't feel as significant as it should.  Perhaps a Spielberg would have made it too shmaltzy, but here you're left wondering just how Danny really feels about the whole experience once it's over.\n\nCharles Dance does a great one-eyed villain (with a different glass eye for every occasion) and Tom Noonan plays the other villain, something of a slasher-movie type monster called \"Ripper\".  Anthony Quinn is around as a bit as Dance's employer who stupidly keeps making idiomatic malapropisms in the manner of Biff in Back to the Future; we know his minutes are numbered from the get-go.  Art Carney has a nice little cameo as Slater's \"favorite second cousin\" and Bridgette Wilson is there to lend some serious hotness.  There are some nice little specific movie references - Olivier's Hamlet transformed into Jack Slater's (\"to be, or not to be...not to be\" as he blows up the castle behind him) and Ian McKellen doing Bergman's death - but overall the satire is outweighed by action setpieces, and the film has a rather slapped-together feel to it, unsure as to what to do other than lumber towards a big splashy finish.\n\nStill, it's mostly fun, and I have to say that I wasn't as bothered by O'Brien as I was on seeing it when new.  I think Arnie was fairly into it also, and that's important.  Probably average for his ouevre, and for all it's faults, another reminder as to why he really was not just the biggest but the best American action star of his era: he had the best talent around him, and he rarely seemed to take his image as seriously as people like Seagal, Stallone and Norris did.","summary":"Self-reflexive Arnold film isn't as good as it could have been - but even OK Arnie is still worth a look","unixReviewTime":1277510400,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

That's the question explored in the early '90s cult action flick, Last Action Hero.\n\nYoung Danny (Austin O'Brian) spends his time watching cheesy action flicks, particularly those by action star Jack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenegger). When an old projectionist gives Danny a magical ticket, Danny is transported into one of Jack's movies where the laws of physics (or reality) don't have much meaning. It seems like the perfect world for Danny until Jack's nemesis (Charles Dance) finds the magic ticket and enters into the real world. It's up to Danny and Jack to stop him, but without the luxury of movie magic.\n\nWhile many action movie fans (such as myself) will enjoy the cult nature of this movie, others will find it too corny and tongue-and-cheek. Last Action Hero, while expertly written and executed, is a parody of itself and of all (especially '80s) action movies, but in taking this route, has used too many \"in\" jokes. In fact, a few of the jokes even had to be explained to me, because I didn't understand all the little nuances of the screenplay. I can easily understand why some viewers won't enjoy the film's style of humor, but I can also see how it became a cult classic.\n\nThe picture quality is absolutely phenomenal. It's so crisp and clear that, quality-size, it feels like a modern movie. The colors are so vivid that the film feels like it's jumping off the screen (almost literally, making the nature of the movie itself even more interesting). I've never seen this film (okay, so I missed the DVD version and only saw the VHS version) ever presented in such a beautiful way before.\n\nThe sound has also been improved, and instead of having to turn the volume way up in order to hear anything outside of the action sequences, it was considerably more manageable. Between the picture and the sound, all of the over-the-top, corny action sequences really came to life here and made me feel like I was part of the action (which seems to be a key aspect of the movie's original intent). Presented in crystal-clear 1080p high definition in 2.40:1 widescreen, this is the best quality Last Action Hero can ever have. This edition also has Spanish, French, and Portuguese audio as well as English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese subtitles.\n\nHowever, I found the bonus material here (or lack thereof) very disappointing. Now, since I've only see this movie before on VHS, I don't know what was included on the original DVD release (if anything), but I was hoping for a little more in this version of the movie aside from just gorgeous sound and impeccable visuals. Instead, Last Action Hero on Blu-ray features Movie IQ, which allows for semi-annoying (if you haven't seen the movie a few times before) pop-ups that give interesting information about the film, and Blu Live, which seems to be a common feature among all Blu-ray movies meant to direct viewers to Sony's online store. There's no deleted scenes or outtakes (my personal favorite extras) or even interviews with cast and\/or crew. While I understand that since this an older movie and keeping up with extra features was very different then, you would think that they could have come up with something.\n\nIt's difficult to say whether or not the Blu-ray edition of Last Action Hero is worth it, especially with the serious lack of bonus features and the relatively high price tag associated with Blu-ray disks. If you are looking for flawless video and audio quality, then the Blu-ray is the perfect choice, but if you're looking for new material, then save your money and check out the DVD (or even VHS) version of the movie.","summary":"Last Action Hero Blu-ray","unixReviewTime":1265241600,"vote":9.0,"image":null}

Amith","reviewText":"A year after Arnold Schwarzenegger's \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\", in 1993, he followed up with the summer action film \"Last Action Hero\".\n\nThe film was directed by John McTiernan (\"Die Hard: With a Vengeance\", \"The 13th Warrior\", \"The Thomas Crown Affair\") and a screenplay by Shane Black (\"Lethal Weapon\" films, \"The Monster Squad\", \"The Last Boy Scout\") and David Arnot (\"The Adventures of Ford Fairlane\").  The film featured cinematography by Dean Semler (\"Bruce Almighty\", \"The Alamo\", \"The Longest Yard\", \"2012') and music by Michael Kamen (\"X-Men\", \"Band of Brothers\", \"Frequency)\".\n\nAn expensive film which cost around $85 million, the film was literally a spoof on action films and would feature cameos from many stars around that time.  From Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Ian McKellen, Tina Turner, Robert Patrick and many more.\n\nThe film revolves around a boy named Danny Madigan (played by Austin O'Brien) who is a big fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger action films, especially his character Jack Slater.\n\nThe problem with Danny is that he rarely goes to school and it's become a problem since he spends his time watching movies and his mother covers up for him.\n\nWith the release of \"Jack Slater IV\", his friend Nick (played by Robert Prosky) who runs a very old rundown movie theater that is not doing so well, Jack gives him a sneak preview to catch the movie.  Nick also talks about how he was given a gold-ticket by Harry Houdini but never used it.\n\nNick tears the ticket in half and gives Danny the other half and as Danny is getting involved and enjoying the film, the ticket starts to magically work and next thing you know, Danny is inside the film for \"Jack Slater IV\" and in this world, things work like the movies and not real life.\n\nAs the film progresses and Danny sticks with Jack Slater and the two take on the bad guys which include the evil Englishman Benedict (played by Charles Dance).  But somehow along the way, Benedict steals Danny's ticket and has now cross over to the real world where Danny has come from.\n\nIn the real world, Benedict starts to learn that bad guys can win and starts killing people and noticing that the police are not there to stop him.  So, Benedict comes up with an idea to stop Jack Slater and that is by killing off the real actor that plays him...Arnold Schwarznegger.\n\nCan Jack Slater and Danny stop Benedict in time?\n\nVIDEO & AUDIO:\n\n\"Last Action Hero\" is featured in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has given this film a pretty good treatment as they have with \"Cliffhanger\" and \"Air Force One\" in which they kept the film as close to what we see on the big screen, including the fine layer of grain.\n\nFor a film that is 17-years-old, the film looks good for its age and because there is so much happening throughout the film.  For example, in Danny's world, you can see how run down the theater is, old-style seats and everything is dark and there aren't any vibrant colors.  Until he goes into Jack Slater's world, then colors are vibrant and much better visuals.  Definitely a major improvement from the 2003 DVD of \"Last Action Hero\".\n\nNow, where this film shines is with its lossless audio soundtrack.  Featured in English, French, Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1, one thing that \"Last Action Hero\" had when it was first released in theaters was the fact it was the first film to utilize Sony's Dynamic Digital Sound.  Granted, at that time, many theaters weren't equipped to play SDDS but there was concentration on the film's audio and that is where this Blu-ray shines.\n\nThe opening sequence alone shows you that the film is going to utilize all channels and thus bringing a more immersive soundscape as you hear gun shots, explosions, crashing metal, booms all through your front, surround and rear surround channels.  Subwoofer utilizes the booms and for the most part, this is the best I have ever heard from this film.  The lossless audio soundtrack for this 1993 film is very well-done!\n\nSubtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES:\n\n\"Last Action Hero\" comes with no major special features but is BD-Live enabled with movieIQ which allows people to obtain real-time information of the cast, music, trivia while watching the film.\n\nJUDGMENT CALL:\n\nWhen \"Last Action Hero\" first came out and when I watched in the theaters, I figured a pairing with director John McTiernan and Arnold Schwarznegger (known for their action films) would be a wonderful pairing.  But I can remember how impatient I was getting because the film seemed so long (especially at 131 minutes).  I felt that the arc where Danny is in Jack Slater's world tend to drag quite a bit.\n\nBut I admit that I enjoyed how it was a satire of action films and also featured cameos by many celebrities.  By the third and final arc, things started to get more interesting as Jack Slater is pulled out of his magical world and now having to deal with this new world that he is quite unaware of.  For the most part, \"Last Action Hero\" was a good popcorn flick but I do remember that since it came right after \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\", there was high expectations.\n\nNeedless to say, despite what the critics may have felt about the film, \"Last Action Hero\" did well in the worldwide box office and even some appreciating the film much more now than when it first came out in theaters back in 1993.\n\nFor those who purchased the 2003 DVD and are big fans of the film, you maybe wondering if the Blu-ray is worth buying.  The bad news is that there are no special features on this Blu-ray unless you have BD-Live and you can take advantage of the movieIQ function.  But other than that, I'm still amazed that for a film that was quite expensive, featured so many talent did not have any featurette created for it.  No commentary, no theatrical trailer, there is no special features and to me, that's surprising.  But the Blu-ray is a major step up in picture and audio quality and that is where fans of the film will appreciate its HD release on Blu-ray.\n\nOverall, \"Last Action Hero\" on Blu-ray is literally a barebones Blu-ray release but for Schwarzenegger or McTiernan fans and those who truly enjoyed this film will definitely enjoy it much more with its video and audio upgrade.","summary":"Blu-ray: Similar to its 2003 DVD counterpart, the Blu-ray is another barebones release...","unixReviewTime":1264464000,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

For years we have been blessed with so many laughs and enjoyment from our bulky headed California governor that we felt the need to get another one of his films in. At this point the pickings are very slim since we pounded away at the Arnold market for a year straight in 07. However we were reminded that Last Action Hero still lies in wait and luckily our friend on-demand just happened to have it available.\n\nOur film starts off with young Arnold movie obsessed Danny Madigan as he hangs around at his local movie theater. He's a regular and has befriended the boss from Mrs. Doubtfire who moonlights as the theater owner, who invites Danny to a secret midnight screening of the new Jack Slater movie. Sounds a bit to catch a predator sketchy but the old man checks out and was not just \"some old guy wanting to perv you out.\" Somehow the ticket Danny receives is magic and transports him into the back of Arnold caddie. From there he tags along everywhere in a world where the movies are a reality.\n\nFor us the film was worth of four star rating off the two simple facts that Eclipse is the first face you see on screen and Apache from the immortal&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Death-Ring\/dp\/B00069QD74\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Death Ring<\/a>&nbsp;makes an appearance. Yeah that's right Apache, awesome. That also lead us to believe Arnold is a big fan of Apache's work since he also had him play the exact same driver role in Predator. Yeah you have no idea what we're talking about but you'll just have to say \"well I'm not used to that but that's fine.\" Unfortunately Sid was on the cusp of quite a nerve racking situation thanks to the real life 40 year old virgin and couldn't enjoy Last Action Hero quite as much as we wanted. Despite that the movie was a laugh riot filled with soundboard lines and goofy dialogue. It's one worth checking out for the Arnold enthusiasts out there.","summary":"I'm the famous comedian..Arnold Brownswegger","unixReviewTime":1258416000,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

The humor hits(the outlandish stunts, shooting TNT away with bullets, the hackneyed catchphrases, a funeral filled with strapped mob families etc). My biggest gripe with the film is that it has to constantly explain itself through that craven kid. Its obvious that Daniel is the voice of reason in this movie and what an annoying voice that is! Plus he is a major wimp. You mean to tell me that somebody breaks into your house armed with a knife, dares you to stab them in the back with the knife and you do nothing? What a wuss! Besides these flaws, this movie is still underrated gem that is worth picking up. A noteworthy satire on ludicrous action flicks and compared to the rubbish that passes for parody now(Date Movie, Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, Meet The Spartans etc)it holds up well after all these years.\n\nI'll leave you on this note: Not every movie that bombs at the box office is bad and not every movie that succeeds in the box office is good. There are plenty of movies that failed at the box office that are good and there are some movies that succeeded at the box office that stink to high heaven.

My how things have changed since those carefree days when a million cameos and lots of explosions could make up for terrible writing and weak direction.\n\nThe Good: Tom Noonan as The Ripper is genuinely creepy and makes a great arch-foe for our Hero.  Jack Slater is a character with hilarious moments, especially when he calls himself, \"Arnold Groundschmuger, the famous comedian\". The spoof on the action genre is much funnier in retrospect than at the time of the film's release. Bridgette Wilson in cut-off jean shorts, 'nuff said.\n\nThe Bad: Danny Madigan goes from being cute to annoying so many times it makes you wish Benedict would just shoot him already.  Once the movie crosses over into the real world and Jack's \"crisis\" with being a fictional character the movie loses its focus and gets to wrapped up in whatever moral it failed to get across to the audience.\n\nI would be willing to own this movie for the first hours worth of fun and comedy if not for the terrible pan & scan work that was done on the transfer (and I'm not shelling out $27.00 for the widescreen version).

Take big star, add big action, add a bit of seriousness, then a bit of spoof then to finish it off add a interesting plot. You have Last Action Hero.\n\nI've always thought this movie was brillant. You have obvious gags - The glass eye seen at Slater's exwife's house. The cop rotates it completely blowing up the house. Then the next scene Slater and Danny at the police station smoking - literally. I Other scenes are subtle; Robert Patrick leaving the Police station as the T1000 or elsewhere the hubcaps on Slater's convertible change for no reason. Also, look for the E.T. and Lethal Weapon gags.  The gags really get going about 15 minutes in.\n\nMy favorite line these days when Slater punches the Leutenent Gov. in the face. \"Call me when the Governor gets here,\" hilarious stuff now that Schwarzenegger is the California Govenator.\n\nI can see why this movie failed. The average action fan doesn't like it when a movie is spoofing what it bills itself as. Action fans take their genre seriously.  You have have a specific style of humor you enjoy to get this. At points the movie almost has a cartoon style feel. That things happen for no reason. Personally, I think that adds to the charm of the whole thing. There is a comic book quality here.\n\nThe biggest outrage about this movie is the current DVD release. Full screen pan & scan? C'mon, other regions of world (R2, R4) have beautiful widescreen releases with some features and AC\/DC's video for Big Gun. Why do we not have this? Flabbergasts me. Sony\/Columbia Tri-Star should be embarrased for this terrible North American release.\n\nI hearby call on Sony\/Columbia Tri-Star to give us this title as Europe and Australia have. Thank goodness I have a region free DVD player. I have the R2 version of the movie. Looks sharp.\n\nAs for the movie is it deep and causes you to think about your place in the world? No, not even close. Is it a fun popcorn chomper that will have you veering to serious to spoof in a matter of seconds? Yes, absolutely. Is it worth seeing Ahnold spoof himself? Yes.

Wilson","reviewText":"WHAT IS HOLLYWOOD'S PROBLEM, ANYWAY? THIS IS THE GREATEST FILM EVER MADE. Okay, maybe I don't honestly believe that. Maybe \"The Cable Guy\" is a little bit better. Okay, maybe it's a toss-up. I can't decide. Oh, hell, never mind!\n\nI guess what I'm getting at is I am damn sick and tired of listening to people rag this movie. I'm so sick of it, in fact, that I will outright lie through my teeth to people who dislike it and tell them that it is my favorite film, even though it really isn't. It isn't my favorite films of Arnold's by a long shot, but I still rank it in the top-ten. It isn't even one tenth as bad as they say it is. There were avid Schwarzenegger fans who actually came to loathe Arnold after he made this movie. Why, I ask? WHY? I DEMAND TO KNOW! Is it the acting? Is it the script? Is it the story and the premise? Special effects, car-chases, what? Okay, the acting is corny. I give you that. The story is far-fetched and the action is over-the-top. I give you that, too. But guess what, you stupid sh*ts? IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY! This film was intended as a social commentary. It is satire. It was intended to make fun of movies by example. It points out the most inherent flaw in all of cinema. Fantasy! That's right! It exposes the film industry for what it is. That is, a circus, a mad house, a rabid dog, a wild beast, a monolithic volcano of glamour, pretense, vanity, and and... AND just... shrill-shrieking-FRAUDS.\n\nOkay, that's it then. I just answered my own question. The reason Hollywood holds such disdain for this film is simply because it does not like being the subject of such debates as morality and ethics. It's not like it is any big secret, though, that Hollywood is full of phonies, Satanists, (...)and demon worshipers. The world knew that years ago. It doesn't seem to hurt the grosses, though, does it? People keep seeing the movies. They keep watching television. They keep tuning into that political media circus that is the Oscars. Holly weird is clearly doing okay. So, why did this film scare them so? Don't ask me.\n\nAll I can tell you is that Arnold Schwarzeneger had to have a lot of balls to be in a movie like this. Especially when he was still a relative new comer to the acting profession and to America. But hey, it's just an action movie, and it's got a good plot.  Still, there seems to be no end to the contempt that film makers and critics have for Arnold. That isn't what pisses me off the most, though. What pisses me off the most is that the movie-going public could be so gullible and stupid as to accept whatever Hollywood tells them about a certain flick. Not critics, mind you. Nobody pays attention to critics anymore. Especially the stupid rich ones with their big thick books and their big thick mustaches. No, I'm talking about the entertainment industry, at large. Usually if every actor, every director, every producer, and every talk show personality gangs up on a certain individual, or a certain film and shouts at the top of their collective lungs \"THIS PERSON'S WORK IS TERRIBLE. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE,\" everyone believes them. What these people should be yelling is \"WE ARE FEARFUL. WE ARE JELOUS. WE WANT TO SEE THIS PERSON FAIL\"  That's all entertainment is about. It's about one artist stabbing another in the back. It's not about teamwork anymore. Usually if enough people in the profession denounce a certain person's work, the rest of the world will think \"Well, gee! Everybody in Hollywood thinks this movie sucks. It must be true. Well, I'm not going to waste my money\"\n\nThat is why this film bombed. Not because of its quality or lack thereof, but because of quantity. That is, quantity of people in the business who SAID it wasn't any good. And the so called fans just like the toadying bunch of impressionable troglodytes and knuckle-draggers that they are, fell for it. They stayed away from the film in masses. And what do you think happened? Well, the film flopped of course. It is Arnold Scwarzenegger's most daring attempt at artistic genius and nobody went to see the ****ing thing. Well, let me tell you something. I DID SEE THE FILM, AND I LIKED IT! AND I'M NOT ALONE! But I'm sick of being made to feel like a doofus any time I defend this flick. I am tired of people laughing at me when I tell them that I am an Arnold Schwarzenegger fan, or a Jim Carrey fan, or a Norm Macdonald fan, or a Stephen King fan. I'm sick of it, and I won't stand for it. If anybody here needs to feel ashamed it is YOU POEPLE! I don't care what anybody says. So, you can all kiss my a$$ and go to hell. I love this movie, and I'll KILL ANYBODY WHO TRIES TO CHANGE MY MIND.\n\nThat being said, buy this DVD. It's certainly cheap enough (unfortunately for Arnold).","summary":"Simply the best!","unixReviewTime":1097020800,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

I dare say that most folks who went to this film just didn't \"get it\". Too bad for them.\n\n The major flaw of the DVD is that the film is presented in the god-awful Pan and Scan format. Pan and Scan presentations of frenetically-shot widescreen films should be outlawed, it's just that simple. You almost get a headache watching this P&S version. The digital pan is so obtrusive and distracting that it can drive one to anger! It pulls you out of the film, to say the least.

Krug","reviewText":"You've probably read this film's plot description already, but let me sumerize it briefly just to comment on it: Austin O'Brian is a huge Swartzenagger fan. Arnie's latest films (acording to this film,) are the Jack Slater movies, which (presumably) came out right after Terminator 2. Danny idolizes the character Jack Slater, a fictional L.A. cop, in the same way that so many of us idolized Han Solo. Then one day Danny's personal friend Mick, an elderly theater projectionist, gives him a magic ticket that was given to him by Houdini, just before Danny gets to watch the latest Slater film all by himself, before anyone eles does. (Jack Slater 4). Danny watches as the film introduces the two bad guys, who've kidnapped Slaters cousin Frank. The scene shifts to two nameless cops (who of course are sure-fire dead meat) who come to Frank's house after getting a false call about a drug deal. Slater arrives and wonders why they're here, he goes in and finds Frank tied to a chair, Frank gives Slater one last message before dying, Slater sees a note that turns out to be a count down and gets out just before the house blows up, the two red shirt cops...well, need I even say? A car full of dynomite-weilding bad guys drive up, Slater gets in his car and the chase is on! Then something strange happens. A stick of dynomite comes out of the screen and lands in the theater! It blows up, and Danny finds himself in Slater's car, now a character in the film!\nI couldn't understand why so many critics and audiences hated this. Naturally I was upset when it bombed in the theatre. It was the most origonal film to come along in quite some time. I mean, really, who hasn't fantasized about being able to actually go into the world of their favorite movie or T.V. show and interact with the characters? Thankfully I see most people on Amazon have given this between four and five stars, so I'm not alone. I loved the action, the humor, (which is basically making fun of typical action films and just how absurd they are, even the ones that are meant to be taken seriously) and the one-liners.\nO.K., here's one thing I _didn't_ like: the animated cat. I mean, what the @#&%?! The film works when it spoofs typical action films and ridiculous they are, but not when it goes all the way into the realm of farce and becomes something like Airplane! or Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Everything eles was fine, but the cartoon cat...well, when's the last time you saw a conventional action film with living cartoon characters? Really, what were they thinking?\nAlso, there was the bit where (POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING) we learn about half way through the film that Slater's son Andy was killed. This presumably happened at the end of Jack Slater 3. So Jack Slater 3, it would seem, ends with Slater shooting the Ripper (the bad guy from the last moive), and then the Ripper pulls Andy over with him. Would a typical Hollywood light-hearted action escapest film really have such a dark ending? Well, then again, I guess Lethal Weapon 2 had a simular ending.\nAnyway, don't listen to anyone who's told you not to see this. This is not another dumb action movie, this is a film pokeing fun at dumb action films (including some of the ones Swartzenagger's made). Check it out for yourself.","summary":"Great under-appreciated movie, but gets a little too absurd.","unixReviewTime":1090195200,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

And it turned out to be quite good!\nThis was filmed before Austin O'Brien became truly cringeworthy, with a god-awful haircut in My Girl 2. He's exactly the same here, and there were times I wanted to take a pair of scissors to his hair! (I've just seen a more recent photo, and he looks totally different!)\nLast Action Hero has an almost Willy Wonka quality to it. There was a golden ticket that Charlie Bucket had to find and Danny Mannigan also had to find one - or actually got handed it. I was so waiting for Oompa Loompa's to come out! Now that would have been cool.\nThe whole story climaxes in Arnie being brought out of the movie, and getting to see the 'real' world, which is a very interesting concept, as it could be seen as we're not the ones in control. (I totally believe that) So his whole life was one big lie, and controlled by someone else - not the big man upstairs, but a film director. Arnie basically takes the p*ss out of his whole on screen persona in this, including lots of his trademark sayings, including: \"I'll be back!\", \"Trust me\" and \"Do it\". There's also a very funny scene where Jack Slater meets Arnold Schwarzeneggar - make sense of that!\nAlso look out for a whole host of cameos in this movie - ones which are easy, to spot, some which aren't! Some of these include: Chevy Chase, MC Hammer, Sharon Stone, Little Richard, Maria Shriver, Robert Patrick, and Jean-Claude Van Damme!\nThere are some great lines in this. Some of these are:\nDanny Madigan: You think you are funny, don't you?\nJack Slater: I know I am. I'm the famous comedian Arnold Braunschweiger.\nDanny Madigan: Schwarzenegger!\nJack Slater: Gesundheit.\nJack Slater: Kid! Who does the doctor treat?\nDanny Madigan: Patients?\nJack Slater: Look at the elbow of my jacket. What is it doing?\nDanny Madigan: Wearing thin?\nJack Slater: Bingo!\nBenedict: Gentlemen. Since you are about to die anyway, I may as well tell you the entire plot. Think of villains Jack. You want Dracula? Dra-cool-la? Hang on\n[takes out the ticket]\nBenedict: , I'll fetch him. Dracula? Huh. I can get King Kong! We'll have a nightmare with Freddy Krueger, have a surprize party for Adolf Hitler, Hannibal Lecter can do the catering, and then we'll have christening for Rosemary's Baby! All I have to do is snap my fingers and they'll be here. They're lining up to get here, and do you know why Jack? Should I tell you why? Hmm? Because here, in this world, the bad guys can win!\nSo if you're not keen on Austin O'Brien, see how many celebrities you can spot, and how much Arnie acts up in this movie!

It's funny, it's witty, with lots of those one-liners that Arnold became so popular with, and I loved the way he constantly poked fun at his fictional character as well as his \"real\" self. Some of my favorite dialogue in the movie is when the kid is trying to convince \"character Arnold (aka: Jack Slater)\" that he's actually just a character in a movie. The kid starts asking about phone numbers and how can they possibly all start with 555- in a city with several million phone numbers, when Jack Slater exasperatedly says, \"That's why we have Area Codes...\" Priceless. The movie is full of fun stuff like that, and I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is even remotely a Schwarzenegger fan, or who just like campy, yet intelligent, movies. The parody within a parody, and movie within a movie actually worked well in this one.\nI thought the movie had a lot of great character performances, and clever scripting, and I think this movie got a bum rap. It's really a great movie, I'm glad I bought the DVD. The transfer is a little sloppy in places on the one I bought, but since it's a \"Special Anniversary Edition\", I have a feeling that had something to do with it.

Big time movie fan, young Danny Madigan (Austin O'Brien) receives a magic ticket from his old pal Nick- the projectionist of the films.  After getting a chance to see the new JACK SLATER movie before it opens, Danny is enjoying the action packed-soon to be-blockbuster when the ticket starts glowing.  A stick of dynamite blasts through the screen and BOOM!  Danny is in the movie as Jack's comedic sidekick.  Then, when Danny becomes Slater's new partner, he must track down Tony Vavawldi and his henchman Mr. Benedict.  The adventure is on!\nMY REVIEW:\n\"This is obviously an underated SCHWARZENEGGER adventure flick!  It was sweet!  The action, the explosions, the humor, the one liners- all good.  Of course this isn't ARNOLD's best movie, but it does pretty well!  It may unbelievable, but what ARNOLD movie isn't?  Think- TERMINATOR 1 & 2, PREDATOR, THE RUNNING MAN, END OF DAYS, THE SIXTH DAY, JUNIOR, TOTAL RECALL, TWINS- all unbelievable ARNOLD films- but still entertaining!\nARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER and AUSTIN O'BRIEN make the best team!  LAST ACTION HERO rocks!  The opening scene says it all!  Have fun!  That's what fantasy movies are all about!  So enjoy this fun flick to catch with friends or just to watch with popcorn!\"- MJV & the Movies.","summary":"The bad guys are in there!","unixReviewTime":997660800,"vote":7.0,"image":null}

LAH is one of those films that thinks its a lot more hip and clever than what it really is.  It claims to be a spoof of the action movie genre when all it really does is shake its own hands.  The jokes are not funny and yet you get the feeling that the people responsible for this cinematic atrocity are sending a subliminal message that translates as, \" That skit was pretty cool, huh?\".  The action sequences, intended to be absurd, only elicit yawning.  The child, who was intended to be cute, is annoying.\nThe only saving grace, if you can call it that, LAH has is Arnold Schwarzeneggar's performance.  His (non)acting is just as good in this movie as it is in THE TERMINATOR or TRUE LIES.  If the only good thing about your movie is Schwarzeneggar's acting, then your movie is in serious trouble.\nI like a good spoof movie as much as anyone, as long as it is funny like BLAZING SADDLES or THE NAKED GUN movies.  But I think this movie was best described on an episode of THE SIMPSONS.  On that episode there was a fancy party in which all the beautiful people of Springfield attended.  There was a character at the party inspired by Arnold Schwarzeneggar named Rainier Wolfcastle.  Police Chief Wiggum walked up the Wolfcastle and said, \"Magic ticket, my a**!\".  My sentiments exactly.","summary":"Excessive on all counts except quality","unixReviewTime":996796800,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

The action is great and  the comedy is just right for an Arnold flick, although there's a bigger  focus on it than most of his other action flicks.

The truth is the film is a lot better than a lot of people are willing to admit.  In Woody Allen's  \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" a desperate women falls in love with a  character in a film she watches who just happens to jump out of the screen.  Well it is basically the same sort of formula only a kid gets in on the  action of the latest Schwarzenegger film, \"Jack Slater 4\" yet  befriends the character and not the actor who thinks all of it is real and  not a film.  True, it is not as bittersweet as Allen's movie but I don't  find that to be a flaw.  It is a very fun movie and it was very enjoyable  the whole way through.  Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great parody of  himself as Slater who spits out one liners during violent conflicts.  I  even found Austin O' Brien to be a fairly decent child actor in this film  and that is a rare suprise in this sort of a film.  The film is also backed  by a great score of hard rock music from AC\/DC, Alice in Chains, Megadeath  and more.  John McTiernan and Arnold Schwarzenegger suffered heavy blows  with this film.  True, it was not either of their best work but I think the  critics were way too cruel.  Its should not be viewed as a failure but as  an enjoyable action adventure that it is.","summary":"A very underated Schwarzenegger film.","unixReviewTime":958348800,"vote":17.0,"image":null}

This movie works beautifully on several different levels.  As an action spoof it is hilarious, with many in-jokes, gags and cameos.  As a fantasy it is ingenious with Austin O'Brien very  appealing as a kid with a \"magic ticket\" that can transport him  from the real world into the fake world of action films. And it works  splendidly as a send up of Schwarzenegger's movie image giving him a big  chance to do what he does best-poke fun at himself.  It also works as one  of the most original buddy movies ever.  There is a lot going on here and  it will take a few viewings to catch everything but that is what makes a  good movie good.  The action is wall-to-wall, no doubt, like many other  action films, good or bad.  The sequences are very well done but contrived,  just like many of those previously mentioned films. But they are contrived  for a reason-to spoof the genre.  Because a lot of people who originally  saw this didn't get it, it is, in this critic's humble opinion, one of the  most misunderstood films of all time.  That accounted for its bad reviews  and low box office.  But it is my belief that this was largely due to poor  marketing.  When Schwarzenegger (who served as executive producer) would  appear on television to plug it, he made a fatal mistake.  His description  of this as a family movie was wrong.  It is very violent, even though that  too is done for a purpose.  Imagine what a lot of parents thought when they  took their kids to see this and within the first fifteen minutes or so,  several people are killed or injured and there are gunshots and explosions  galore.  It is a mistake that to this day Arnold's career hasn't been able  to completely recover from. Be that as it may, you must see this film for  what it is and enjoy imagination and spoof at its finest.

But this one is not only their best, it's arguably their best production period, ever.\n\nFor the first and only time, Jim Henson brought together the creations from all his various Muppet universes--Sesame Street, The Muppet Show, and Fraggle Rock--into one prodution. The results are hilarious and magical.\n\nMy only complaint is that a few songs are cut out of the special for copyright issues, providing a somewhat disjointed feel to the presentation on the DVD.

Adults however will  be able to watch alongside without getting bored: it's the fact that the  Muppets are so watchable that reaps benefits for this movie.","summary":"Fun For Christmas","unixReviewTime":963705600,"vote":null,"image":null}

The body count is marginally higher.  Creatively speaking, it doesnt offer anything new to the genre.  But at least Jennifer Love Hewitt can add screaming to her list of talents.  The plot follows the two survivors of the first film.  At this point, Julie James (Hewitt) is prone to nightmares, providing false reality to add some much needed horror elements.  She is separated from boyfriend Ray (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) in distance and priorities.  Julie and her roommate Karla (Brandy) prove they have no knowledge of capitals and can't recognize a FAMILIAR voice that they are well acquainted with on a daily basis.  They think theyve won a FREE trip to a crappy resort in the Bahamas.  A resort almost barren of guests and staff.  Nothing suspicious there!  And its not the least bit worrisome when bloody bodies go missing, someone having cleaned up the crime scenes in an instant: spotless!  Blood is not that easy to clean up!  The rest of the movie requires a lot of running, screaming, hiding, dying..............\n\nLogic aside, this is standard fare, entertaining enough in its own right, but nothing special.  The extra, tacked on ending, is a bit of a cheat and doesnt really work.","summary":"Its our version of winter.","unixReviewTime":1478131200,"vote":null,"image":null}

While the 90s resurgence in the genre tried to change many things about the genre, the quick sequel was not one of them.  Thats why, a year after the first came out, we got I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.  It needed more time to iron out some serious plot issues (and considering this is a slasher, thats saying something).\n\nAs the movie opens, its been a year since fisherman Ben Willis (Muse Watson) stalked Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt) and Ray (Freddie Prinz, Jr.)  and their friends and two years since the four friends hit Ben with their car and left him for dead.  Julie is still struggling through all that has happened, which is why she finds herself struggling with grades while in summer school again and having recurring nightmares.\n\nThings are looking up when her friend and roommate Karla (Brandy) wins a trip for four to the Bahamas over the 4th of July.  When an invited Ray doesnt show, Julies friend Will (Matthew settle) joins Carla, Carlas boyfriend Tyrell (Mekhi Phifer), and Julie for this trip.  They arrive on the island just before the first storm of the season hits, leaving them stranded as the only guests on the island.  But a message for Julie leaves her convinced that they and the skeleton staff are in danger.  Is she right?  And what happened to Ray?\n\nThe film actually gets high marks right away for addressing the tag from the previous film and trying to give us some character development for Julie and Ray.  Unfortunately, in an effort to increase the tension, we get several painfully obvious false scares before we get to the island and the movie really begins.\n\nNow heres the part where Im going to be painfully stupid.  One of my problems with this film is all the people who are killed when Julie and Ray are the real targets.  I get that this is a slasher film.  I truly do.  That means lots of people have to die.  But I don't get why we are going after the people who do die.  In the first film, the collateral damage victims make a little bit of sense, but not quite as much here.  And this doesnt bother me in the Scream films like it does here, either.  Go figure.\n\nSo leaving my personal issues aside, we do get some decent stalk and kill sequences and a mix of sympathetic and annoying characters to be eliminated.  This part is all well done, and when the storm hits and the killing starts, its easy to feel the tension building.\n\nWhich brings me to the part that feels rushed.  In an effort to provide a twist to the story (required of all slashers, especially during the 90s), we learn a bit more about Ben, but none of that makes sense.  Even watching the movie knowing what will unfold, it feels like it is forced into the film.\n\nAnd, despite efforts to set things up earlier, the climax still feels a bit du ex machina for my tastes.  Then theres one characters fate, which makes no sense.  Plus don't get me started on the final scene.  What worked in the first film definitely doesnt work here.\n\nThe acting is still decent, and I don't find anything to pull me out of the film.  Thats impressive considering the script the cast had to work with.\n\nAnd Id be remiss if I didn't point out that the accident that started the whole rampage was actually two summers ago now, so the title really doesnt work either.\n\nThe thing with 90s slasher movies is they tried to be more intelligent than the ones that had come during the slasher mania of the 80s.  Sadly, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer fails in those efforts.  There are still some decent death and chase sequences, so die hards of the genre will want to check it out.  But be sure to turn off your brain before you start watching it.","summary":"All I Know is This Island Didnt Have a Murder Rate Until You People Showed Up.","unixReviewTime":1476748800,"vote":null,"image":null}

I recently re-watched them in honor of Independence Day, and I still love them. They might've even grown on me. I appreciate the suspense more, the kills, the great music as the Fisherman stalks his prey. I liked that you could see his face more in this one, now that we know who he is and why he continues to stalk Julie James.\n\nAnother year has passed, and Julie is still traumatized after the events of the first film. She constantly has nightmares about Ben Willis. Her new best friend, Carla tries to get her to be more outgoing. One day, Carla wins a trip to the Bahamas, and takes Julie, her boyfriend, Tyrell, and new guy, Will. Ray tries to come but he's hospitalized after a run-in with the Fisherman. Once they get to the island, they realize it's an off season and storms the whole time. Soon enough, Ben Willis shows up to stalk Julie and her friends and kills anyone who gets in his way. Ray is on a mission to make it to the Bahamas and stop Willis once and for all. I thought this was a great continuation and a nice conclusion, but it was ruined when I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer was made. It has absolutely nothing to do with this film or the original, so do yourself a favor and don't watch #3.

Julie James best friend wins tickets to the Bahamas and so they go down there with their boyfriends (Jennifer Love Hewitt, Brandy Norwood, Mekhi Phifer & Matthew Settle).

Suspense slowly builds as the cast is whittled down and the storm rages. It suddenly becomes clear that they're stuck on this vacant resort with a mad killer! Although the filmmakers couldve taken more advantage of the resort location they did a good enough job. Bottom line: This is a worthy sequel with its own appeal.\n\nThe film runs 100 minutes and was shot at El Tecuan Marina Resort, Costa Careyes, Jalisco, Mexico (standing in for the Bahamas), and USC, Los Angeles, California.\n\nGRADE: B- (a weak 4\/5 Stars or strong 3\/5 Stars)","summary":"A sequel set in the Bahamas during storm season","unixReviewTime":1446940800,"vote":null,"image":null}

I think it is human nature to be nostalgic about certain things. It's why the WWII generation hated rock & roll, and why baby boomers hate hip hop, because it's not from THEIR\ntime so somehow it's inferior. Because of this when the 90's came along and all of the great horror series of the bygone decade were running out of steam (Halloween, Friday the 13th, A nightmare on elm street) horror movies were still around just not being pumped out week after week at the cinemas. That's until scream arrived in '96 giving the horror genre much needed jolt in the arm.\n\nSeemingly overnight they were back again, one new film after the other and we as horror fans couldn't have been happier!\n\nOkay, okay, okay, I know what your thinking, this is suppose to be a customer review of I still know...and this guy is giving us a history lesson on the genre as a whole, but there's a method to my madness, you see I remember being excited when I saw the first I know what you did...I remember enjoying it, and of coarse when I heard of a sequel I was more than sold on going to see it, which I did, and enjoyed it! Enjoyed it when it came out on video, hec, I even bought the DVD which I still have to this day, but all of those years I watched the actually thinking it was a quality film, it ISN'T! What changed my mind you ask well a little thing called growing up, and when you grow up hindsight is 20\\20.\n\nYou see I know now why I really thought this film was good when I was a kid, HORROR was back back in a big way so I would, and did go to see any and everything back then and usually enjoyed the movies, but know as an adult I realize this movie is goofy at best.\n\nI think I first realized it one night a few years ago when I caught it on tv. Nothing else was one so I decided to watch\nit. It was like I was seeing it for the first time with new adult eyes and I realized how ridiculous it was.\n\nI could go into the plot in more detail but if you guys are reading this you probably already know the deal. Let's just say JLH survived \"slicker guy\" in the first film and now his back to finish the job, but this time there on an island with a scary old guy, someone who I think may be Jack Black in a bad wig, and POP STAR BRANDY! It's ridiculous from start to finish, from how they are lured to the island, why they are lured to the island and the goofy kills that happen throughout.\n\nThere are things that happen that are so ridiculous(Freddie Prinze Jr's character hijacking a boat at gunpoint and sailing through a storm, at NIGHT no less to save his ladylove but I mean it's JENNIFER LOVE HEWITT after all, you wouldn't do the same?\n\nDespite realizing now as an adult that this movie was simply just a way to cash-in further on the who's the killer genre before the public lost interest it still is entertaining and fun to watch!\n\nIf you've been living under a rock and somehow have never seen the I know what you did...films watch the first one first (a much better, well made film) than watch this one next, but when watching the sequel forget about LOGIC, and good storytelling, just seat back and enjoy a bunch of pretty actors running around an island being chased by a guy in a raincoat!\n\nIs this movie good? - Not in the slightest bit!\nIs this movie entertaining? - HELL YES!!!!!!\n\nP. S. Don't forget to checkout a certain character's death by hook that is quite possibly the WORST CGI ever in the history of CGI, it's hilarious!!!!!!","summary":"One of my Favorite \"It's so BAD it's GOOD\" movies!!","unixReviewTime":1436745600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Julie is now in college, taking Summer classes in Boston; trying to avoid Southport to put the past behind her. The past still haunts her on a regular basis however as she constantly has visions and dreams of the murderous, vengeful fisherman, Ben Willis coming after her.\n\nThat afternoon, Julie and her best friend, Karla win tickets for 4 for a getaway to the Bahamas for 4th of July weekend via radio station call-in after answering the question of the capital of Brazil correctly.....or incorrectly. While Karla brings her boyfriend, Tyrell along on the trip; Julie plans on asking Ray, her boyfriend from the previous film to come along, but he initially declines out of frustration of her refusing to visit him in Southport. With Ray's ticket now on the table, Karla brings along her best friend, Will, who has a crush on Julie---and off they go!\n\nOnce the 4 arrive in the Bahamas, they discover that others have left due to a tropical storm on the way. With it just being the 4 of them plus hotel staff, things seem to go great so far...until Julie begins receiving mysterious notes, reminding her of \"what she did\" and until the staff and crew begin getting gruesomely killed off one by one by a familiar hooded figure with a hook for a hand. What Julie hoped to be a peaceful and relaxing Summer has now turned into another hellacious nightmare. Some things you just can't bury.\n\nOverall: This was an okay sequel. I Still Know What You Did Last Summer moves away from the suspenseful thriller kind of movie that viewers witnessed in its predecessor and transitions to more of a slasher horror. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. reprise their roles from the first film as the couple of Julie and Ray. Logic doesn't seem to play much of a factor in this movie which definitely deducts stars from this rating. For example the entire radio call-in scene is questionable in terms of answering the question correctly. Also, Julie is constantly receiving reminders saying \"I know what you did last Summer\"; but in this case, shouldn't have been 2 Summers ago, considering that's when it all started? Or is the killer now mad about supposedly getting killed off last Summer? I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is one of those movies that have you asking too many questions throughout the duration of the film. The acting is subpar on certain levels as well. This would mark the last of the I Know What You Did films to feature any of the original cast and crew as a third sequel released in 2006 titled \"I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer (avoid at all costs) featured a fresh new cast.

The only difference was that Scream was actually creative and made fun of silly movies like this one.  Throw in every horror\/slasher movie cliche this one had it.  I am all for having to suspend disbelief when watching one of these movies, but things like the killer being able to movie bodies around in a short period of time, and leave no trace of blood is just stupid.  Unlike the plot twist revealing the killer in the first movie, this one was easy to spot a mile away.  Plus we are subjected to Jack Black as a dreadlocked stoner.\n\nThe two things that this one had going for it is that the dialog was not as schlocky and stupid as it was in the first one.  And, despite the tease at the end of the movie, they thought better of making any more of these.  Like the predecessor I do not think this is a must see or must own.

You can see the twist the second you meet the character and everyone plays their crappy cardboard cut-out roles like a factory produced them. Really it's so unremarkable, so what's the appeal? Well the first one was a big success, so obviously it's riding on the coat tails, but what is it about dumb kids being underwhelmingly picked off by some guy in a raincoat.\n\nReally it was entertaining to me though just because how stupid and typical it was, from the opening 'jump scare' where the white virgin wakes up in the middle of highschool class, I knew I was in for a craptacular 90's slasher. So white virgin wants to work on school like a good girl until her evil fun-loving black friends have her reluctantly come out and meet up with THE MOST OBVIOUS F***ING MURDERE-I mean sweet awkward innocent JC Penny Model # 12. The implications behind this movie are laughably obvious. \"Ohhh she's so sweet and innocent, she deserves to live, but the fat stoner deserves to DIE! Take that people I passively look down on!\".\n\nAlso in a packed and crowded club the director knows that another cheap jump scare needs to be tossed in or else the mouth breathing teenagers won't be interested, so white virgin sees a shadow reminding her of the killer until she realizes it's just the dark, but wait, it's the corner of a club with couches and everything, and no one's sitting there? Have any of them actually been to a club or did they have to ignore basic club settings in order for the cheap phoned in jump scare to work.\n\nSo eventually they wind up on the tropical island for some stupid trivia thing with the worst hosts ever, for CREEP FACTOR we have to have the hotel staff be antisocial and intrusive, the maid for example ignores white virgin, \"oooooh, how creepy, she doesn't respond\" F*** you that's stupid. Then they meet the hotel owner who glares at them and basically makes them feel as unwelcome as possible, even though his business seems to be going into the crapper. Then they meet Jack Black playing himself, and the guy seems friendly enough, basically offering the guests some marijuana if they need some, then Tiesha is all like 'get away from me you smelly hippie', there goes what little amount of empathy I had for these characters.\n\nSo much more stupid crap happens without a shred of thought or time put into the production, even the kills are PG-13 caliber (well by today's standards) and we often cut back to Freddie Prince Jr. doing, something? I don't really know what he just has a bad feeling and runs around, apparently as fan service to the girls watching. Then we get more standard cookie-cutter unorignal scenes such as NO ONE BELIEVING WHITE VIRGIN GURRL, or Token black guy is the first of them to get offed and no one seems to care.\n\nThen later we meed biker chick who runs the bar, and while virgin white gurrrl lives, random biker chick is killed off, because the white suburb kids watching need to know that that lifestyle is looked down upon and you'll likely get murdered if you live like that. Token black girl living was only a treat for virgin white girl because no one else really cared about her character.\n\nSo OH NO CREEPY AWKWARD WHITE DUDE TURNS OUT TO BE THE MURDERER, no f***ing s***, who didn't see that coming a mile away? Then he disappears throughout the second half of the movie and only pops in once in awhile to remind the audience \"hey I'm still here\", then finally shows that he's the bad guy to the last retard in the audience who couldn't tell and puts his EVIL FACE!!! on. This wimp is the least threating villain ever, and his dad comes up and f***s him in the ass or whatever, I stopped paying attention at this point, this movie SUCKS! I put as much thought into this review as they did into this movie.","summary":"I STILL TASTE S*** IN MY MOUTH THANKS TO THIS CRAPPY MOVIE","unixReviewTime":1344211200,"vote":null,"image":null}

First of all if Karla is Julie's best friend and sees how much Julie likes Ray why is she trying to hook her up with someone else. She's not trying to help her alleged best friend and comfort her just go and sleep with someone else. Knowing that Julie is somewhat paranoid and Karla knew most of the story that Julie went through why is she sneaking around the apartment in the dark with no lights on in the house and if they go to the same school why would Karla think Julie was out of town, looks to me classes are still going on\n\nTo make this movie even more ridiculous, Karla the genius says Rio as the capital of Brazil and for those who know geography very well know right off the bat that this was a set up. Bill Cobbs' character knew that it was the wrong answer but yet didn't say anything to warn the four people that Rio was the wrong answer and help them try to go back home, waits until the last minute for the body count to pile up.\n\nBen Willis have so many opportunities to kill Julie when she's at the club, in the bathroom, in the tanning bed and don't do anything plus he could have killed Ray after he fell but didn't do anything there either. So this killer is a complete moron but the victims are even dumber when some of them were armed with weapons ( a knife, axe, baseball bat mind you) they completely forget they had these weapons and don't make it a possible 3 on 1 attack and just run. Don't even try to work together to kill this man.

Shame the same can't be said of this sequel, which crams in every slasher clich known to man with such little awareness of how hackneyed it all is that it actually seems to believe this is scary stuff.  In a fit of apparent desperation, writer Trey Callaway packs Julie (Hewitt), survivor of the first film, off to an island in the Bahamas when she wins a holiday thanks to a radio show calling her number. Joining her is fish-faced Karla (Brandy), her boyfriend Tyrell (Mekhi Pfeiffer, who I seem to remember used to have a promising career) and spare wheel Will (Matthew Settle). Joining them soon after that is the killer fisherman, who engineered the prize (the fact that Julie's number's unlisted doesn't set off any warning bells) and proceeds to slice his way from one end of the movie to the other. There are no boats scheduled for days, the phones don't work, and there's a storm on the way...you get the picture.\n\nYou can practically hear director Danny Cannon, whose last movie was the underrated \"Judge Dredd\" and who deserves a lot better than this, sighing behind the camera at just how witless all this is. Cannon does manage to captivate the beautiful island scenery and the excellently-captured eeriness of the hotel at which the quartet of teen protagonists are vacationing (it's also a sort of sad waste of overall possibilities when you reflect on how they utilized these potent settings); a couple good scares throughout, though nothing scary, as if any movie could be deemed such; Freddie Prinze, Jr. is certainly not a notable talent, yet he exudes sufficient charm and is a likable hero; Mekhi Phifer, in a stereotype black tough-guy role, gives his role some enjoyable attitude, but his disbelief of Julie's claims that a killer's on the loose become tiring and cruel. \"I Still Know...\" fails due to a maddening lack of logic, intelligence, and most plausible qualities of humanity in all the characters; entirely arbitrary and thus boring murders of all the islanders we don't even really know is an obvious compensatory ploy for the fact that only two of main five characters are killed; technically mediocre acting (except Hewitt), plus bothersome, forgettable work from newcomer Brandy; low-IQ script; splotches of incompetent directing throughout; an incredibly demeaning and character-betraying \"shocker\" finale that essentially tosses this film into the pile of identical slasher formula flicks from the past 20 years.

And all the girls, who are mere mortals, and do not have hair & makeup artists, great clothes off a rail which you don't have to pay for, and who are not blessed with such generous ... good looks :) are going green with envy!\n\nOK, so that's my rant over. Considering this is a horror movie, and it's a sequel to a horror movie, you'd think there would be a third too right? Wrong! For some reason, the makers didn't follow the Scream route, and make a trilogy (or the following Scary Movie), but decided to go down the Urban Legend route, and only release two films. When we all know these horror movies are supposed to be trilogies! All great films are trilogies, come on! OK, maybe I'm going OTT. Actually, I should be reviewing the first one, but the disc of that, has sprouted legs, and gone walkabout. No doubt following Broken Arrow, and my necklace - hopefully not!

Hind","reviewText":"I can understand why a sequel was made to \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" because of the ending of the original.  But I DON'T get why it had to be so stereotypical and poor.\nThe sequel follows Jennifer Love Hewitt's character Julie to college, where she still has flashbacks of that fateful summer where she was being chased by a hook-wielding killer.  Her roommate Karla, played with limited acting skills by singer Brandy, tries to take her mind off things and suggests that Julie dates someone new (Julie and Freddie Prinze Jr.'s character Ray are estranged at the film's start).  To their surprise, the girls win a trip for four to the Bahamas for answering a trivia question in a radio contest.  Julie invites new crush Will (Matthew Settle) and Karla takes along boyfriend Ty (Mekhi Pfeiffer).\nHere's where the problems start.  First of all, the writers must think that the average viewer of this film has a third-grade education.  Intelligent audience members smell a rat early on in the film when the girls incorrectly answer that the capital of Brazil is Rio de Janeiro (it's actually Brasilia).  When the real answer is revealed at the climax of the movie, did the writers expect everyone to go \"Ohhhhh!!\"?  I hope they don't think we are THAT stupid!\nAnother problem:  the geniuses behind this film were obviously trying to clinch the attention of the males in the theatre by having Jennifer Love Hewitt run around in white t-shirts drenched with rain.  As a heterosexual female, I got tired of seeing Ms. Hewitt bounce around and felt this move was cheap on behalf of the filmmakers.  Well, with a sub-par plot and mediocre acting, I guess they felt the need to do something.\nOne more pet peeve:  why must Hewitt sing at some point in every TV show or film she appears in?  I cringed at the contrived karaoke scene in this movie.  Don't you think it would been more obvious (and probably more enjoyable) to have already-established pop star Brandy sing a song?\nViewers sit through one cliche after another until the unsatisfying and predictable twist is revealed at the end.  And then the ending itself is another cliche, hinting once again at another installment.  Thank goodness it hasn't been made (yet).\nChalk this up as another unnecessary slasher flick specifically made to capitalize on the success of \"Scream.\"  While \"Scream\" had a certain wit to it, this is plain silliness rolled up with blatant T & A.  Don't waste your time.","summary":"I still know this is bad....","unixReviewTime":1065657600,"vote":7.0,"image":null}

The fisher man with the hook for a hand is back after Hewitt and her obnoxious friends which include returning Freddy Prinze, Brandy, and Mekhi Pfefier as the token black guy.\nA year after the first incident, Julie (Hewitt) and company have won a trip to a tropical resort. Little do they know that it has all been set-up by the killer from the original and he is looking for a little more retribution. A predictably gory onslaught ensues to the backdrop of an incoming storm that is making life even more difficult for these poor kids.\nHewitt is the highlight of this film- but not for her acting chops. Her beautiful cleavage and knack for wearing soaking-wet white T-shirts is really the only redeeming value in this very dumb sequel. Jack Black as a goofy white wannabe Jamiacan is too annoying for words. Freddy Prinze is as terrible as always in his portrayal of goofy guy-next-door Ray. Love gets to do her thing here as she not only sings karaoke but gets to explain to co-star Pfeifer why \"her people can't dance\". Even tremendous character actor, Bill Cobbs, is wasted in this awful sequel. It's over-acting galore as Hewitt and Brandy trade screams and arguments back and forth in the rain.

This movie is cheesy, unrealistic and downright silly, but I loved the first movie, and Jennifer Love Hewitt is irresistible. I know I usually have a different word to everyone else on these types of movies, but if I enjoy myself, that is how I base my rating. This movie is my one of my best guilty pleasures, and I don't care what everyone else thinks, I enjoy watching it and that's me.\n Now ... why do I like this movie? There are many reasons. For starters, it's got everything a fun teen slasher requires. Lots of big breasts, reasonably good acting, truckloads of gore, unpredictable twists and turns, some big laughs, a scary killer and a brilliant setting. To add to that, the movie never stops with the scares, is never boring and had something that I really appreciated. In some teen slashers (Urban Legends: Final Cut especially) the main characters really don't really seem to care after their friends\/people have been killed. In I Still Know What You Did Last Summer; Julie James is a very respectable character. She stills mourns for those she has lost and those she may lose. I was actually shocked with the amount of emotion the movie put on when showing Julie's new life and what she goes through.\nThe acting in the film is satisfactory for a horror film. Jennifer Love Hewitt returns as Julie James and once again she proves she's not just about looks, this girl can act. I want to see her give a performance that can give that idea more justice, not just horror movies please! Still she is good as Julie. Freddie Prinze, Jr. also returns and he has improved his acting skills. He puts on a solid performance. Brandy is very eager in the material and her performance worked for me. Mekhi Phifer had me rolling in the aisles with his fun performance as Brandy's horny boyfriend. I also enjoyed the underused Jennifer Esposito as the bartender on the island, and Jeffrey Combs' breakaway as the ruthless hotel owner. Muse Watson is scary and evil again, his facials are fantastic, but every time the guy talks I cringe. I just can't take his lines that seriously. Bill Cobbs is merely okay as the weird guy on the island who is suspected as the killer.\nDanny Cannon's direction of the movie deserves recognition. The guy makes sure the movie looks great and brings tonnes of atmosphere to the movie. The killing scenes are done to perfection. I was glad he didn't just take the point-and-shoot routine that many horror movies use these days. Cannon put effort into his surroundings. Unfortunately the film editing is pretty atrocious. The characters' mouths move a lot when they're not saying anything, and injuries are cleared up very easily, like in one shot the person is hit hard with something, and then in the next shot they're running like hell and not even a bruise. Think about the editing techniques next time, Dan.\nTrey Callaway's script is not perfect. While he does mix in freaky-as-hell horror with funny-as-hell comedy quite well with some great in-jokes and an excellent setting for a horror film, there is not much depth or range in the film. He does make sure all the possibilities are used for the killing scenes and horror action, but if Kevin Williamson had written this sequel, I feel it would've been a little more plausible. If you've seen the end of I Know What You Did Last Summer you'll know what I'm talking about, Ben Willis just couldn't of survived.\nBad editing, some silly dialogue, unanswered questions and cheesy lines do stop the movie from being great. There is also not enough depth to the film and damn, what was the final scene all about? But, excuse that and you've got what is my favourite guilty pleasure at the moment, and a fun slice of harmless horror.\nMY GRADE: B","summary":"Dumb fun!","unixReviewTime":1018224000,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

Later, there is a supposed hurricane, but the production company wouldn't put out for more than one rain machine, so it's pretty dinky.

So off they hop to a conveniently remote island with Brandy's boyfriend and a random guy that they don't know.

The scale would work as follows: 1: So bad I'd now just as soon have not liked the original. 2: My liking for original is intact, but sequel adds virtually nothing to my enjoyment. 3: Sequel enjoyable mainly on the strength of how original made me care for the characters and their continuing story, not a great movie in its own right. 4: Sequel satisfying, coming close to or rivaling the original in quality. 5: Exceptional sequel, surpassing the original in quality. So, in the case of this movie, the sequel leaves considerable room for disappointment but maintained my interest because the first made the characters interesting. Even at that, Jennifer Love Hewitt came much closer to having to carry the movie this time, because Freddy Prinze, Jr. was reduced to cameo-level appearance this time, and most of the rest of major players in the original played characters that didn't survive that movie. Particularly missed in the sequel for the latter reason were Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, and especially the undercast Brigette Wilson. Other things that detracted from this sequel are that the screenplay, editing, and\/or direction seemed amateurish at times. The main Character Julie (played by Hewitt) sings \"I Will Survive\" as a karaoke song, a scene better omitted. I can't speak for viewers unfamiliar with karaoke, though I suspect they might have limited appreciation for its inclusion in movies. But those of us who are karaoke singers and\/or listeners know that \"I Will Survive\" is one of the most run-into-the-ground of karaoke songs and we're sick of it. Also her scene where she gets into the sunlamp box is also awkward and probable not too pleasing to anyone. Those not liking scantily-clad scenes will find it \"exploitative\", but those who do will find it tame and unrevealing. Other awkward moments would become ponderous to enumerate. Julie's new boyfriend in the movie, who accompanies her to the Bahamas (the reason for Prinze's sparse appearence in this) is played in an awkward way, and his character's transitions along plot twists are lame and not highly believable. As for the scenes set in the Bahamas, they were actually filmed in Mexico and it shows. They show good-sized mountains, non-existent in the Bahamas. But in that department, this sequel in no way outdoes the original in impertinance, for the original had some mountain scenes too, even though ostensibly set in and around Southport, NC, an area where all land within view is at least as flat as the Bahamas. The most memorable new character in this sequel, though even he has been called ineffective and\/or miscast, is a resident pothead in the Bahamas, played by Jack Black. His character has some mildly funny moments, though they missed a chance to give him what could have been the movie's funniest line. In the movie, most every character at one time or another falls under suspicion of being the killer on the lose; when it came the pothead's turn to be suspected, he should have said, \"Don't look at me - I don't even know what I did last summer!\" The end of the movie seems a possible set up for still another sequel. If one is made, I hope it can come closer to recapturing the quality of the original rather than languishing at the level of this first sequel.","summary":"SEQUEL SET AMIDST LOVELY VIEWS OF GREAT BAHAMIAN MOUNTAINS","unixReviewTime":1013644800,"vote":null,"image":null}

Almost all sequels are worse (not always bad, just a bit less enjoyable) than the originals films which spawned them.\nThis film has everything the original had (including... Jennifer Love Hewitt!!!) and even more. There are more killings, more plot facets (they add in the trip to the Bahamas, Nancy, who is a rather good character, the deal with the voodoo, the storm, and lots of other stuff.) Most sequels are just re-hashings of the first film, just with more blood. But instead, this film had plot as well, and wasn't just pointless killing.\nEstas (im not really sure of his name, but it sounded a bit like that i think) is a great character, and although his part is small he really does give lots to the film. As too does the hotel manager, who was at times hilarious, and at others creepy.\nThere was a nice twist in the end, which made up nicely for the fact taht we already knew the identity of the killer.\nThe acting was okay, especially Jennifer Love Hewitt. Even Brandy, who i had low expectations of, managed to surprise.\nI can't think of many real criticisms of this film, apart from perhaps the slightly corny dialogue at times, and Ben Willis's voice, which really managed to get on my nerves. Otherwise, all aspects of this film were great. there was some nice scenery, good acting, a really superb plot, and lots of nice shots of JLH's clevage (which was shown so much it could probably come under scenery!) some great eccentric characters and a cracking ending. (I am not talking about the very very end, that was a bit disappointing)\nthose who are aware of their geography may well get a clue near the beginning. I myself did, but i (foolishly) just put it down to a rather stupid radio station.\nAnd now, the infamous \"ending\".

Five more beautiful teenagers, including two survivors of the previous movie (Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr.) are hunted through a deserted, storm-lashed holiday island in the Bahamas by a hook-handed serial killer in Danny Cannon's lavishly mounted and hugely entertaining potboiler. It doesn't have the strong narrative drive of its predecessor and it tends to ramble aimlessly from set-piece to set-piece, while Trey Callaway's superficial script relies too heavily on implausible coincidences (like the tropical storm which gives the killer a helping hand by rolling into the island almost as soon as our heroes arrive, isolating them from the mainland!), but once the main scenario has been established and the killer has claimed his\/her first victim, the thrills come thick and fast, with one genuinely scarifying climax after the other.\n\nGloriously staged and photographed (in widescreen Panavision, by Vernon Layton), the movie benefits from glorious location work - exteriors were filmed at the El Tecuan Marina Resort in Mexico - and the shameless deployment of a VERY LOUD soundtrack, while the actors do their best within the limits of their shallow characterizations. Look out for the superb Jeffrey Combs and Bill Cobbs in crucial supporting roles.\n\nDirector Cannon - who made a spectacular feature debut with the underrated British crime thriller THE YOUNG AMERICANS (1993) before crashing to an abrupt halt with the poorly-scripted JUDGE DREDD (1995) - begins to turn the screws very early in the film, adding a slightly unpleasant streak of cruelty to some of the murder scenes, and John Frizzell's shrieking music score sets the nerves jangling throughout. Some of the climactic revelations stretch credibility to the limit, but the film employs an eccentric, comic-strip logic which works on its own terms, and subsequent viewing reveals a multitude of clues surrounding certain characters and incidents which are cleverly designed to elude first-time audiences. So, if it's a genuine nerve-shredder you're after, this great big lunk of a movie is just the ticket.\n\nBy the way, there's absolutely no truth in the scurrilous rumor that the third film in this series will be entitled \"I've Got A Fair Idea What You Were Doing Last Tuesday And If You Don''t Stop It You'll Go Blind\"...\n\nNB. In fact, the third film was released direct to DVD under the title I'LL ALWAYS KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER (2006).","summary":"The Hook is back!!","unixReviewTime":1002672000,"vote":null,"image":null}

She seems to be there just to have really hot shots of her body which, um, well, okay, that wasn't a bad thing. Brandy, on the other hand, was wasted. Why was she in this?. Why did she agree to do this?. Freddie Prinze Jr. was another one who was wasted. He got second billing but his part is much smaller than any of the other co-stars. What happened?. The fishermen killer himself was creepy in the first one. Not here. His creepiness was ruined because you see way too much of him in this film. That always hurts a film and character.

This film has very bad reviews and didn't do excellently at the box office, but it isn't, surprisingly, as bad as it is supposed to be. It's not the teen-kill movie for everyone, but it held my interest, and is a pretty solid modern horror movie.\nTwo years after the horrible incident, Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt) is back in college and is worse than ever having dreams about Ben Willis, the man who killed all her friends a couple of years ago. She gets comfort from a new friend named Will (Matthew Settle). Julie's other friend Karla (Brandy) tries to hook the two of them up and when she wins a trip to the Bahamas, she knows that it is perfect. But Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.) is still in the picture and Julie only goes as friends. Karla, her boyfriend Tyrell, Julie, and Will take flight right before Ray encounters the fisherman again. He tries to tell Julie not to leave but it is too late. Now in the Bahamas Julie is starting to lighten up and have fun. Then suddenly things start going terribly wrong when a storm hits the Island and people start to disappear. Ray takes a boat to the Island to warn Julie but will he make it on time to save Julie again from the fisherman?\nIt's all predictable and quite dumb, but if you don't look for a dazzlingly original story and a pitch-perfect script then I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is great fun. Jennifer Love Hewitt is a nice heroine, she is continuously good to look at, and the set decoration is nice, although I found it odd that it was set on a Bahamian island and was shot in Mexico. Still, there is heaps of eye candy in many scenes and there are no breaks from the gore, which is great for teenagers, although the film was a tad too graphic for my liking. The only absolutely major quibble was the editing. Half the time it looked like the actors mimed the words and then put them onto a speaker phone after the shooting, and it looked terribly messy and was a largely irritating flaw. But, don't worry about that too much, just sit back and let this film do what it was made to do - entertain.\nI Still Know What You Did Last Summer is far, far away from perfect, but both as a silly slasher flick and a stupidly entertaining brew, it works quite admirably.","summary":"A guilty pleasure of mine","unixReviewTime":985392000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Litton","reviewText":"\"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,\" if nothing else, should at least get an Academy Award for Longest Movie Title of 1998. In fact, the title could be a testament to the movie itself: unnecessarily long, cheesy, and a big letdown as a sequel to a movie that is only slightly better. The plot is pure contrivance for the conveniance of putting its characters in unspeakably tedious situations, the acting and characters are equally uninvolving, and the overall message gleaned from this film is one that portrays it as a pointless excuse for bloodletting and gore.\nThe movie picks up where the predecessor left off, with a silly dream sequence that seems to belong in a comedy spoof of these films instead of here. Julie apparently has been haunted by these dreams for many months since her last encounter with the killer from the first film, Ben Willis, who fell off the boat in the end of the movie and was never seen again. Until now, but more happens before then. Julie's best friend, Carla, wins a trip to the Bahamas by answering incorrectly to the question requiring the capital of Brazil. Of course, given the mentality of this film, I wouldn't expect too many people to know the right answer, and I guess the filmmakers were counting on that, too.\nAnyway, Julie calls up long-lost Ray, asking him to go to the Bahamas with her, Carla, and Carla's boyfriend Ty. Ray refuses her, but then decides to surprise her. Of course, on his way to meet Julie at the airport, he is set upon by Ben Willis, and ends up in the hospital, from which he escapes and spends the rest of the movie trying to reach the resort. That resort is Tower Bay, where the group, along with newcomer Will Benson, who has it bad for Julie, finds out that the resort is left entirely to them due to the incoming of heavily inclimate weather. \"This is our version of winter,\" says the hotel clerk. So pretty soon, the rain is falling, and so are the bodies, moreso than the first movie, and much more gratuitously.\nThe movie really has nowhere to go but down from here, relying heavily on gore, blood, and useless plot twists to create what they hope will be a sense of tension and suspense. No such luck. Yes, we do spend some time wondering who is going to meet the fishhooked Ben Willis next, but since we never get the chance to know the characters, we never can care for them once they are killed, sauteed, gutted, and what-have-you. There is never a moment in this movie where you'll find yourself saying, \"This is such a good film,\" because there's never any reason to. What makes it even worse is that the movie makes itself out so that it is not necessary to see the first in order to get the second. It spends so much time dwelling on the past that its concern for its own events are missed by a longshot.\nNothing but contrivance for this film as well, bringing us the same, tired situations that its characters dwell in, going over the same old routine until we feel like we've seen every horror movie known to man. Ben Willis was supposedly killed in the ending of the first, and even if he's alive, he missing a hand. Not a problem. Slap a new hook on him in place of the severed hand, one that's permantently attached, so he can kill quicker and easier. Now the characters need to be placed in the most vulnerable of positions at key points in the movie. All taken care of; just send them to a secluded island paradise that is about to experience a major weather crisis. Need a couple of simple characters for extra bloodletting. Hotel management: 'nuff said. Are you seeing a pattern here?\nAnd what is with the secondary characters of the movie, anyway? One of them is the waitress in the hotel bar, who always seems to be giving us hints that she may have something to do with the killings going on, but trust me, thinking that way leads nowhere. And what about that pot dealing freak with the dread locks? This is as hokey a character as you can get, and never have I seen such a waste of plot on such a stupid character (though I kept wishing he'd hand me a joint to get me through the rest of the movie). The character of Will is a wuss, enough said, and even when it comes time for his major involvement in the plot, it turns out to be one of the cheesiest and most contrived aspects of the story.\nI had a hard time trying to decide as to whether or not this is one of those bad movies that happens to good actors, or if they should be held responsible for getting into it. Hewitt and Prinze, Jr, who reprise the roles of the earlier film, should have known better when they read the script that this material would not be sufficient enough to live up to the standards, however low, set by the first film. Brandy Norwood and Mekhi Phifer are the newcomers in the places of Phillipe and Gellar, and Phifer is the most amusing as the oversexed boyfriend who turns sexual frustration into comedic relief; Brandy is okay on TV, but I think in this case, a bad movie happened to her as an actress.\nIn watching this movie, I kept thinking to myself, \"People are actually going to like this.\" Then I found myself thinking of the demographic group who would gobble this stuff up and actually enjoy it. This is going to appeal mostly to young teens who want to be more like the older set of teenagers who have seen movies like this, one of those \"in-crowd\" movies that makes you look popular. To those who fit into this group, you're in for a sorely rude awakening.","summary":"I don't want to know what you did the summer before last.","unixReviewTime":985219200,"vote":null,"image":null}

I  liked the first movie a lot; it was suspenseful, imaginative, and pretty  scary.  The acting was generally better too.  This time around, the acting  and script are pretty irritating.

Secondly, Freddie  Prinze's character is such a jerk in the beginning, you can't believe his  sudden transformation.  Third, I figured out the villain very early in the  film, so there was little suspense.  The acting overall is lame; Jennifer  Love Hewitt has decided to join Neve Campbell in the \"I'm only doing  this for the money, and I'm really wasting my time in this silly horror  movie.\"  She does look a lot like Kate Jackson in this one, though.  Freddie Prinze is absolutely awful, completely unconvincing, and a pretty  shoddy hero, to boot.  The guy who plays Titus is an offensive,  stereotypical insult to intelligent viewers, providing none of the comic  relief the director obviously wanted.  Jeffrey Combs, who was so good in  the \"Reanimator\" movies looks as bored as Miss Hewitt, and does  nothing to pad his resume.  Three actors do manage to rise above their  material:  Jennifer Esposito as Nancy, the barmaid is very good; Brandy is  surprisingly effective as Julie's best friend, although her character does  become annoying and stupid; and Matthew Settle as the good-natured Bill is  very effective.  I still think Gorton's should sue for using their  fisherman image, but it is a horror movie.  That's what so sad.  It could  have been a lot better, but it's too predictable and a little too gory, as  well.

It isn't that long, but it feels extremely drawn out, which  shows the suspense it is lacking. The plot is very flimsy-even for a horror  movie. After only the first 45 minutes I was asking my brother if it was  nearly done.\nA positive is the characters. There interaction is the only  thing that interested me at all. Besides that, the way the director  constantly tried to lead you into beleiving something was going to happen,  then it not happening, then happening a couple of seconds later was  irritating and uneventful. Someone was trying too hard.\nSo, sadly, this  didn't make me jump or even bat an eye once. And then there is the white  guy who's acting like whats seems to be a Jamaican-and thats in the big,  bad stereotype way. Probably meant to be comic releif but you only end up  wanting him to be killed off so you don't have to suffer with him anymore.\nI think I've ranted enough but last words: don't bye, rent.

It was  such a throwback to those 80's slasher films. Also, I knew right from the  beginning who the killer's accomplice was. Will Benson! That sounded a  little too much like Ben Willis.

The Seventh Sign was not your run of the mill horror  film.  What it lacked in blood, guts and gore, it made up for other ways.  The acting was excellent; Demi Moore was brilliant as the pregnant young  woman about to give birth to the first soulless child who will herald the  end of the world.  Jurgen Prochnow in turn was superb as God's witness on  earth and even Michael Biehn gave credence to his supporting role as Demi's  disbelieving husband.  Many Jacobs who plays the young Jewish boy Avi also  deserves a mention, all in all the entire cast were brilliant. This is a  much under-rated film as it is intriguing, atmospheric, and well put  together.

For some reason I've never heard about it until now, and what's especially surprising (to me at least) is that Demi Moore would star in such a movie.\n\nI had to do some research in order to write this review because otherwise my review would have been too vague and probably inaccurate if I hadn't (not that it's anything to write home about either- admittedly my mind shuts down when religion becomes the subject because that opens the door to an overwhelming amount of information).  It's about the character of Jurgen Prochnow portraying Jesus.  He comes back to Earth.  At first it seems his mission is to cause Demi's character harm and in particular harm the baby inside Demi's belly which is why Demi constantly visits the hospital for checkups and worries something might happen to either her or her baby.  Complications arise frequently- some of them real others in Demi's mind.\n\nHowever without spoiling too much, Jurgen's character arrives to intervene.  He finds himself battling a mysterious ageless priest (Peter Friedman) who wishes to cause harm to Demi's baby.  Throughout the movie we see Demi constantly sneaking into Jurgen's room because he's renting a room on Demi's property and she suspects something is suspicious with his attitude.  She becomes nervous upon finding out all the paperwork he has up there related to the Apocalypse.\n\nDemi's husband (Michael Biehn) often thinks Demi's crazy whenever she tries to explain Jurgen is trying to destroy her baby and\/or the world.  She discovers many notes that lead her to think bad events are coming for everyone because sudden earthquakes and damaging hail storms start occurring out of nowhere.\n\nWhen Demi searches for answers by knocking on the door of a family who she believes can offer help, she unintentionally has a conversation with Manny Jacob's character who walks by and overhears the chaos Demi accidentally causes with the upset family.  He explains that she's disrespecting the family by doing certain mannerisms that are against their religion, and due to a twist of good luck, Manny happens to understand and interpret the language she's looking for answers from.\n\nWhat makes the Seventh Sign so good is the atmosphere and writing.  There's never a dry moment in this movie, right down to Demi thinking she sees Jurgen everywhere around town, to the amazing conclusion that you'll probably see coming but won't mind because it makes sense in the context of the story.  There's another element to the story that involves a young man who murdered his family and is set for execution, but to be honest it's really confusing trying to understand how this all ties into Jurgen and Peter's characters.\n\nSimple put, while I'm skipping over tons of information here, Demi has to sacrifice someone for her baby to live.  It's really sophisticated and though the story was confusing to follow at times, I never seemed to get *too* lost.  The atmosphere, characters and writing continued to impress me the entire time, and with heavy emphasis on Exorcist-style religious scriptures in the writing which is an easy comparison to make, I'd say the Seventh Sign is a fantastic movie but on a slightly lesser scale than the Exorcist in creepiness, atmosphere and writing, but then again the Exorcist is a horror classic so it would be really hard to out-do that movie.  It comes close though.  Great movie.\n\nThere's many layers of storytelling to a film like this, and whether all the religious information is real or fiction I wouldn't be able to tell you.  Either way I highly recommend this movie.  Even if you know next to nothing about the religious stuff explained here, this shouldn't present a problem in understanding what's going on.  Demi playing lead role in a movie like this is just amazing to me!","summary":"the sign is everywhere","unixReviewTime":1463616000,"vote":null,"image":null}

If you like these types of movies, you should also check out \"Revelations\".  This movie, \"The Seventh Sign\" is not as good, in my opinion as The Omen, Omen II, Omen III:Final Conflict, and Revelations.  However, it is well-made and the acting performances were very good.  Perhaps one of the most solid performances from Demi Moore in her career.  Michael Biehn and Jurgen Prochnow also lend their talents here.\n\nThe end of the world is coming, according to the signs.  River water turning to blood, ice in the desert, and the moon changing colors are all signs that the end is near for mankind.  The premise here is that the supply of souls in heaven has run out, and when the first soul-less baby is born, the destruction of mankind will be irreversibly set in motion.\n\nThe story takes place in Venice, CA.  Of all places for mankind to prevent the apocalypse it had to be here, right?  Well, you have to be willing to buy into it, naturally.  An exotic setting, perhaps somewhere in old world Europe or the Middle East would have been my preference, but California is what we have.  Abby and Russell Quinn play a young couple who is trying to have a child.  Their first attempt ended in stillbirth.  One day, a stranger claiming to be a linguist arrives in town and asks to rent the couple's garage loft.  Not long after, a mysterious priest starts meddling in the couple's affairs, doing everything in his power to ensure that Russell's client (he is a lawyer) faces execution for his crimes.\n\nThis is a pretty good movie.  If you have seen those other movies above, and you liked them, you will most likely like this one.","summary":"A decent apocalyptic themed movie.","unixReviewTime":1417132800,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

Some may instead view as more of a drama but the horror elements are there and it was classed in our genre.\n\n Indeed it does not have a high body count, much gore, or attempt to really frighten - but it does deal with a terrifying premise: the apocalypse. It also has some disturbing images woven throughout and is darkly themed. It is more of a horror meant to disturb and deeply interest than lightly entertain or terrify.\n\n Demi Moore is surprisingly exceptional in the role of a woman who wants a baby more than anything in the wolrd. Michael Beign is her husband, a man attempting to save someone off of death row. We love when either of these are on screen and they both shine. Michael Beign is the gorgeous type of guy already familiar with horror - from The Terminator and Aliens to other sci\/fi, disturbing roles. As far as I know this is a first for Moore but she conveys fear well and causes sympathy. What also helps is that her character is actually interesting. We see her side of things and get into her mind a bit, making the movie play out even better.\n\n The plot itself is that the apocalypse has come around and it all evolves around the upcoming death of an unmentioned person\/situation who we later see in the movie. The movie involves an old poem\/source called \"The Gulf\" which is also known as the hall of souls. A mysterious stranger comes to town and rents out the room subletted by Demi Moore's character Abby. It is shown by the very start that he is the ressurected Jesus, who has come to start the signs and cause destruction. After each seal is broken another nightmare ensues.  An a subplot there is a situation involving Abbys unborn child - apparently before this pregnancy she had not been able to carry her last infant to full term. Her mental stability is based on the survival of her pregnancy and the stress of the events coming forth are not helping. We get to see her flashbacks, dreams, fears, excitement for children, worries for herself, ect., while she is trying to figure who this stranger is and if he's in any way part of everything that's going on. Other mysteries insue and we as the audience are drawn in and held tight. The husband Michael is out of the picture a lot of the time working at his job but he is apparently worried about the health of Abbie. When he's there he adds, when he's not the plot continues without fail.\n\n So overall, if Abby can figure out this mystery, she will be the woman that gives the world a second chance and stops the end of all mankind.\n\n Unfortunitely she doesnt know what the hell is going on and we follow her through different confusing paths. She thinks \"Jesus\" is actually some madman into some sort of strange rituals at first and then keeps evolving her opinion. Her emotional problems don't help her at all but are a great addition to the film.\n\n Along with unusual dreams and freaky flashes, beautiful music and story emotion on all levels, the Seventh Sign is a classic religious film often overlooked.\n\n People not of the Christian faith may have a little more trouble losing theirselves in the plot but if so I pity them. To me watching a movie effectively comes with the ability to open your mind to the beliefs and settings of the characters, no matter how foreign or alien the situation appears to you. I can watch The Craft or another film based on pagan religion, satanism, and what not - there is no reason an athiest cannot enjoy a film speaking of Christianity in high terms. Just my opinion though. Turned off by a film by the content alone seems sad, like you lack the ability to truly \"Just watch a movie\". If you don't enjoy religious sub-genres at all then of course avoid. But if you enjoy some give this one a chance.\n\n If I can accept strange outer space films, giant lizards, made up lands, creatures that don't exist..then I can watch anything and believe in it for those two hours.\n\n In the end The Seventh Sign is summarized as a powerful story that is emotionally wrenching throughout, and a jarring ending you will not forget.","summary":"Different","unixReviewTime":1379635200,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

No one really knew anything other than Demi Moore was in it and she was actually pregnant.  When the movie ended the entire audience got up and left the theatre in absolute silence.  I've never had this experience again.  The movie was food for thought.  It's based on the 7 signs of the apocalypse found in the Bible and The New Testament but it is applied to the current day's happenings with explanations throughout the movie plot to help people who are not familiar with those teachings understand.  With that being said it is not a bible thumping movie.  You are taken through a whole chain of events (with a couple of twists) with the story being centered mostly around this young mother who is pregnant and her attorny husband that unknowingly are participants in the revelations.  You may be able to guess the end of the story as it approaches but it doesn't soften the impact of the message.  It you're a thinker, it leaves you speechless.

Demi Moore stars as expectant mother Abby Quinn in this religious thriller, which never manages to generate any real excitement or suspense. The large scale of ideas that are presented become siphoned by the rather narrow scope that director Carl Schultz fails to overcome creatively. We are only ever allowed to see the aftermath of each disaster, but we never witness the actual onslaught or destruction as they occur. What we are left with, instead, is Moore's character wading through a long series of discoveries that are as bland and predictable as they are tiresome. Jrgen Prochnow plays the only memorable role as the mysterious wanderer, David Bannon, with passable performances from Michael Biehn and Peter Friedman, as well. The final reveal in the end will come as little surprise, and offers even less logic or explanation. Only fans of other religious thrillers like THE PROPHECY or STIGMATA will find any interest here.\n\n-Carl Manes\nI Like Horror Movies","summary":"ILHM Reviews: The Seventh Sign","unixReviewTime":1362873600,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

And I am glad I did. I am not really a religious person so don't know to much about how closely it follows biblical prophecies but one thing I know is that I can relate the messages in this movie (I know not the same things is occuring but the essense is the same) to what is going on in humanity at this time. We are living in a time of chaos and regardless of what race, color, religion you are the world needs healing. And Demi Moores character Abbi does a great job of bringing healing to the world. Which I think what she does is selfless and what she does (watch the movie to know) is what I think always brings transformation and healing to humanity and this is the most powerful message for me.

Smith","reviewText":"Just read the review posted by \"century19@worldnet.att.net\" below.  He hits it perfectly.\nThere are some films that try to be something MORE than they are.  B-Movies are awful,  everyone knows it.  Movies like Iron Eagle, Red Dawn, Batman & Robin, and Alien:  Resurrection are trying to be something they are not; attempting to be  better than they actually are by throwing more money at it, casting bigger  stars, rewriting the already confusing script to cover the plot holes, or  just painting the screen with violence and explosions so they can get the  male crowd to buy the ticket.  This film is rife with so many alarming  problems that make you wonder how funding for it got off the ground.  But,  it was mid-eighties and the Cold War, so we needed flicks that flexed the  American military might and insulted Middle Eastern countries.  This film  is an embarassment to the US Air Force (yes, I am a member) and is  characteristic of America's skewed prejudice of Middle Eastern countries.  The generalized depiction of these people is abhorrent and frankly very  embarassing to watch.  No wonder America seems to not understand that  region of the world.  We take movies more at face value than we should.  If  you want to kick back and just watch it and veg, fine.  Just don't think  it's a realistic and deep film.  It isn't.\nEasily the top film on my  list as the worst ever.  Funny thing is, if it's on, I watch it so I can  amuse myself by ripping it apart.  I guess you could watch it for the  flying sequences.  But, if you're going to do that, why don't you just buy  a video on military aircraft then.\nLeonard Maltin said it, \"not  boring, just stupid.\"  No kidding.

I'm not worthy.  This movie has been quoted to death and picked apart as much or more then any film in the last quarter century.  There is good reason.  More then anything this movie is a study in madness and sanity.  We all  feel as Travis does sometimes.  The world has gone to hell and a rain  should come and wash away all the garbage off the street, all of it.  Of  course we, as sane people, realise this is wrong thinking and get over it.  Travis does not.  Travis Bickle is an  unbalanced person who just wants to  be a normal person, like anyone else.  He tries this.  He gets a job  driving a cab becouse he can't sleep nights \"there's porno theaters  for that\" the cab manager tells him.  And indeed there are.  But  Travis has no interest in sex, he just goes into the pornos becouse that's  were other people go, he wants to be like other people.  Had he lived in a  small town instead of New York, he may just as well have followed the heard  into church or to the mall.  his neighborhood has no churches  so he goes  to see dirty movies.  Travis wouldn't know a dirty movie from a pop-tart.  This is made painfully clear when he asks a girl out on a date.  Bickle is  sitting in his cab whe \"she\" walks by.  Cyble Shepard.  \"she\" is wearing a white dress, she was like an angle in this  filthy mass, \"they must not touch her\".  Travis actually  convinces this high class beauty to go to the movies with him.  You can  guess what happens next.  He takes her to the only movies he knows about.  Needless to say, Betsy (shepards character) is not a fan of \"Somethime  Sweet Susan\" and \"Swedish Marrage Manual\"  She storms off  and refuses his calls.  Travis didn't mean any harm.  He can not understand  why his genuine efforts to fit in don't work.  He becomes angry and self  absorbed.  He meets a 12 year old prostitute and after  his ill fated date  with Betsy goed to see her.  Harvey Kietel is as good as he has ever been  as the pimp who tells Travis about the little girl he is going to see.  I  won't quote him here as I am sure the good folks at Amason would not  appreciate it, but he gives a graphic detailed discription of all the  sexual things Travis can do with this 12 and a half year old girl.  Travis  had no intentions of doing anything with this child.  He talks to her and  says \"you're a young girl you should be in school\"  What a nut.  Any sane person can see that she (Iris) is a whore and can only be a whore.  No one in this film, none of the \"sane\" emotionally stable,  normal people do anything to help or are even upset at this arrangement ( a  pimp and a 12 year old girl) they either buy her services or ignore the  situation.  Bickle takes Iris (Jodie Fosters 12 year old hooker character)  to breakfast and tells her she should not be selling herself on the street  for a bunch of pimps and lowlifes.  In a very moving performance, Jodie  Fosters character looks at him like he is form outer space \"I don't  know who's wierder, you or me\"  She really can't understand that  someone cares about her and that what she is doing is wrong.  The only  person in the world that says what is right, that 12 year old girls don't  belong ont he streets whoring, is a raving nut.  Who are the crazys and who  are the sane? Travis eventually loses control and goes on a shooting spree.  He kills off a bunch of people the police don't like anyway so he is a  hero.  Some problems can only be solved by a crazy, lonely white guy with a  pistol.  \"You talkin' to me?  I don't see nobody else here\".  This is the first time Jodie Foster was recognised as a great actress, she  was nominated for best supporting actress and deservedly so.  Martin  Scorsese has done films as good as this, but never better.  I can't  recomend in enough. \"Lost Johnny\"","summary":"A classic film in every sense","unixReviewTime":919382400,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

TAXI DRIVER explores themes and characters that are archetypically American. If you've ever read about Tim McVeigh or John Hinckley, or ever wondered about the nameless nobody who seems to lurk on your city's streets, you know the Scorsese and De Niro and screenwriter Paul Schrader were there first. This is a brave, moral, explosive and graphic film that has only gained power over the years.\n\nWith its antecedents in literature like Dostoevsky's \"Notes from Undergound\" and Sartre's \"Nausea\" and Camus' \"Stranger\" and French art films likes \"Pickpocket\" and \"Diary of a Country Priest,\" as well as the real-life would-be assassin Arthur Bremer (who shot George Wallace in 1972), TAXI DRIVER takes a new direction by linking its protagonist's psychological wounds with sex and Viet Nam. Bickle's experiences in the war are subtly implied here, and all the more artful and true for that. Travis has been trained as a warrior and then thrown into the urban jungle. Obsessed and horrified by sex and women--what a perfectly American trait--his fantasies soon meld into an orgy of violence and perverted heroism. Ain't that America? A critic once said Travis Bickle was the offspring of John Wayne and Norman Bates. Perfect: misplaced psychosis is interpreted as heroism.\n\nEvery aspect of this film is marvelous and prescient, vividly realized and superbly acted. The violent climax is morally right and true, no matter what any critic says; it is the inevitable outcome of Travis' psyche. Anything less would have been a cheat, dishonest, a lie. Scorsese's appearance as a homicidal jilted husband is blood-chilling; in only a few sentences he sums up the base mentality of, I fear sometimes, this entire American culture.\n\nI can't even watch TAXI DRIVER anymore; it sears my nerves from the opening notes of Bernard Herrmann's score and the first images of hellish, neon-lit NYC. I can no longer bear to see the utter loneliness of Travis Bickle, or hear him say \"I got some bad ideas in my head.\" I cannot watch his conversations with Iris, the 12-year-old prostitute. I can't stand to see him before his mirror, forsaken and frozen, contemplating the darkest things in his heart, playing with his pathetic, terrifying weapons. This is the truest film I know, and if every piece of celluloid in history were going up in flames, this is the only one I'd save. TAXI DRIVER.

A mysterious stranger rents an apartment from them and Demi slowly discovers that she and her baby are the focal point of the end or possibly humanity's second chance.\n\nJesus Christ Himself is one of the main characters and this is one of the best depictions of Christ in film, if not THE best. He's by far the most interesting character in the movie (I'd tell you the actor playing the role but I don't want to give away who the Messiah is as the movie keeps it kinda discreet, not that it's too hard to figure out). I just wish they gave JC more screentime and dialogue since he's so intriguing; it would have made for a much more compelling picture. As it is, the film focuses on Demi and she's just not that interesting a character.\n\nI enjoy movies that make you reflect and try to figure out. This is such a film. Some have criticized that the story is nonsensical, but it's all there clear as a bell if you reflect on it.\n\nOne reviewer criticizes that the film lacks substance, yet the story deals with nothing less than the salvation of humanity via sacrifice, faith, hope and love; plus Jesus Christ Himself is a major character. I think this qualifies as substance.\n\nIf you're having trouble figuring the story out ask yourself this question: Why is Jesus Christ attracted like a magnet to Demi and her baby? Once you have that figured out the story makes perfect sense.\n\nI'd also like to point out that the film is expertly made on practically every level. This ain't no low-budget fare.\n\nPeople seem to have trouble categorizing \"The Seventh Sign\" because it's so unique. I would say it's a mystery\/horror film, but don't think \"horror\" in the sense of a slasher flick, \"Seventh Sign\" is more classy than that. Although there's loads of dead bodies and blood there's hardly any cussing and no youths getting naked.\n\nAs far as Biblical eschatology goes, the story gets it fairly accurate up to a point but then takes a creative turn. If such creative license with Christian prophecy offends you then stay away. Regardless, keep in mind that the main message of the film is completely Biblical, i.e. salvation only comes via the spilling of blood and faith, hope & love.\n\nUnfortunately the film has a bit of a tedious vibe despite the numerous intriguing aspects, which is a major flaw considering it only runs about 90 minutes. Again, they should have given JC more screentime and dialogue as he is definitely the most interesting character. Because of this tedious vibe I give the film an overall strong 3\/5 Stars or C+ (if I was in a better mood I'd give it a weak 4\/5 Stars or B-). In other words, although \"The Seventh Sign\" has some undeniably great elements, overall it's neither great nor horrible; it's somewhere inbetween. Regardless, it's very worthwhile if the subject matter piques your interest.","summary":"Creative take on the Apocalypse","unixReviewTime":1245196800,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

It centers around the seven signs that signal that the end of the world is nigh. When those signs start appearing around the world, the only question is whether the world can be saved. It seems that the answer to that question lies in the grasp of one person. Who is that one person to be?\n\nA very young Demi Moore stars as Abby Quinn, a pregnant woman with a history of miscarriages. She and her husband are eagerly and hopefully awaiting their baby. He is a lawyer who is passionate about his clients. One, in particular, the Word of God Killer, has some significance in how events unfold in the film. The Quinns live in a lovely home with an apartment over their garage that they rent to a mysterious stranger (Jurgen Prochnow) who purports to be a teacher of ancient languages.\n\nUnfortunately, Abby has some issues, as well as a penchant for having a recurring dream that figures prominently in things to come. As the events unfold in the film, one has to suspend belief, as Abby does things that no one having a high risk pregnancy would do, and the plot spirals into being almost ridiculous at times. Still, notwithstanding its deficiencies, the film manages to entertain the viewer and keep one's interest.\n\nThe film has some excellent performances, including that of Peter Friedman as a man of the cloth with a long past. It is Jurgen Prochnow, however, who steals the entire show as David Bannon, the mysterious teacher of ancient languages who seems to carry the weight of the world upon his shoulders. Who he ultimately turns out to be is entirely believable. His performance is so compelling that those sharing a scene with him fade into the background. While exuding sensitivity and caring, he also manages to be one of the sexiest men on the silver screen. His performance is what makes this film worth watching.","summary":"DON'T THEY KNOW IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD?...","unixReviewTime":1242777600,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

In fact so many 70's films exceeded my expectations that I wanted to buy it before I started 1976 to ensure it didn't go under the radar. I'm not disappointed with \"Taxi Driver\" it is precisely what I expected. I think what happened is over the years no one could give me a good reason to watch it. They just said it was great. All the effusive accolades amounted to vapid emotion to me. I want well thought out reasons why a movie is supposed to be good. I don't care who's in it, who directed it, or likes it, no movie gets a pass. If you aren't good then I'm going to say so and \"Taxi Driver\" is not good. It's boring and unfocused.\nFirst and foremost was the daunting burden of having to listen to that droning music for two hours. I don't care if the point was to task us with the mind set of Bickle or not that was just atrocious! It was the musical equivalent to having a pebble stuck in your shoe as you walk: it's there nagging you about how crappy it is and you can't get rid of it and it does nothing other than be crappy and annoying. Completely ruined the movie for me. Now according to the composer it was a reflection of the main character's thoughts and mind set. Well there is an evolution of thought so why did the music remain static? I don't care about the great movies Herrmann had done before,  he did an awful job. It lacked creativity to me. I know the guy is in a cab all night long,  alone, night after night, so what? Is that worthy of any music that would reflect it? How about music that hints at the tedium without being tedious? I understand that Scorsese could have perhaps chosen other songs, I don't really care, just a mess in my opinion.\n\"Taxi Driver\" lacked focus. There was an interesting glimmer of thought where Bickle would judge those who might have been upstanding (Shepard) and worked to redeem those whom might have been considered \"scum.\" I also liked the idea that there is a thin line between hero and villain that plays out. It was just too long of a meandering journey to get there.\nOne of Scorsese's biggest strengths needs to be tempered. He is incredibly aware of the camera's effect on the audience. The way we see only DeNiro's torso then the camera springs up suddenly to his head to reveal his Mohawk was jarring and very well done. The violence at the end was incredibly effective, I was jaw dropped. It couldn't save the story for me though and I wondered if this was a crutch for an otherwise bland ending. I do think the theme of hero\/villain was movie worthy, that is to say there was a good point to the story but it just wasn't enough for me.\nIn the end I think \"Taxi Driver\" was just overrated as far as I'm concerned.\n\nPros\n-DeNiro is great\n-Foster's story line is interesting and compelling\n-theme has weight\n-Superb camera work\nCons\n-boring mainly due to the music","summary":"Nobody Gets a Pass","unixReviewTime":1517875200,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

I can believe that Paul Schrader wrote the screenplay in a fever dream while living in his car: it's mostly about a state of mind, the main character's loneliness and rage. All the other plot details were probably added after the fact. Complementing the script, Robert De Niro buries himself in the part more than in any other film of his career.\n\nThe film frequently feels nervewracking because of how deeply it sees into the protagonist's mind. A few words into De Niro's \"Listen up, you screw-heads\" speech, there is a curious jump-cut and the speech starts over from the beginning. But it's not some avant-garde film device, it's pure reality -- for someone like Travis Bickle, every internal monologue is a rehearsal, he is always imagining himself as an action hero, always playing a scene out in his head, thinking of cooler versions of his \"lines\" and revising them in mid-delivery. The famous \"you're talking to me?\" line is actually part of a long series of threats that Travis makes to an invisible enemy while posing in front of a mirror with his guns.\n\nIn his isolation, Travis can only function in his rare social interactions by relying on cues from previous events. For example, he asks the arms dealer for a specific type of gun, but he first learned the name of that gun only a few days ago when it was mentioned by one of his clients. This completely random event allows him to appear knowledgeable about guns, but really he knows nothing about the type (and ends up buying all of them). Psychologically, this is a fine nuance, one of the things that shows how well the film-makers feel their character. It also contradicts the formal plot of the film -- as a war veteran, wouldn't Travis have picked up some information about firearms? (More importantly, wouldn't he at least have picked up rudimentary conversational skills from the guys in his platoon?)\n\nBut the film-makers don't care about that. According to them, the Vietnam backstory was meant to highlight Travis' alienation from society, and I suspect they just didn't bother to think through plot consistency. For years, viewers have debated whether the ending (in which, ironically, Travis is hailed as a hero) was meant to be \"real,\" or whether it only took place in Travis' head. But you might as well ask that question much earlier. Did the entire shoot-out ever really take place, or was it just part of Travis' action-hero fantasy? Did he really try to assassinate Palantine, or did he just fantasize about it, and then \"revise\" his fantasy to follow the more \"romantic\" storyline of rescuing the girl from the pimps? Did he really shoot the robber in the store? Was he ever even in Vietnam? If he self-importantly tells people that he's \"doing some work for the government,\" why couldn't he make up a Vietnam background? Was his exercise regimen real, or did he just imagine himself holding his hand out over the gas burner? As many critics have pointed out, nearly every scene is told from Travis' point of view, so potentially any scene after the failed date could be the film's last moment of \"reality.\"\n\nIt is intellectually interesting to think about things like that, but unfortunately it is also a weakness of the film. The film-makers had a character, but ultimately they didn't know what to do with him or say about him, or how to end their movie. The film is a perceptive profile of a psychological type that could easily snap and become a loose cannon. But where did he come from, how did he get this way? The film's only explanation is Vietnam, but we have seen many Travis-like characters on the news in recent years, and usually they are not veterans. And, more importantly, is there anything that should or could be done to reach out to people like Travis? Was there ever any way to help him? The ending side-steps this question with some stylized violence, and then glibly criticizes media sensationalism (for you see, they would have condemned Travis for shooting Palantine, but they praise him for slaughtering a bunch of criminals). It's hard to argue with that, but it's also pretty obvious, and doesn't shed any useful light on the main issue.","summary":"Phenomenally perceptive character acting, but with little to say afterwards.","unixReviewTime":1513555200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Perhaps that may be true, but I give pause. I think Taxi Driver is a very good film, but a tad overrated. I was expecting a little more in terms of plot twists and suspense, but it never went there. Still, this is one fine film by acclaimed director Martin Scorsese. I like Scorsese because he doesn't hold back; he doesn't play it safe when trying to tell a story. Some directors keep things light, but Scorsese goes for the gusto, and that triggers the emotional element that's so prevalent in his films. The cast of this film was on top of their game, and even newcomer Jodie Foster is believable in her role as a troubled teen. This blu ray set will keep you entertained for hours, with some nice special features. The picture and sound quality are first-rate for a film that's over 40 years old, so the cleanup job was a successful one. I recommend this iconic film from the cynical 70's as one that should be in your blu ray collection.","summary":"One of Scorsese's Best","unixReviewTime":1511481600,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

I believe one of the aforementioned reviews calls leading lady Demi Moore a \"trailer camp bumer\" and they say she was \"choosen\" to save the world. What's a \"bumer?\" And how is someone \"choosen?\" This is what our High Schools turn out, year after year. That can be even more frightening than most movies. There's no \"trailer camp\" here. She and her husband live in their own home, and rent out a room above the garage. And it's not above some landlords and\/or landladies to root through someone's belongings, wrong as it is. She is a seriously flawed human being, flawed, but in the end forgiven. She's not a particularly pleasant person, but why should she be? To sell more movie tickets? (\"Moore\" tickets? I just kill myself sometimes!)\n\nJurgen Prochnow is an interesting choice of actor to portray Jesus, namely because he doesn't look like Ted Nugent. And at no time in this film is he called by name. \"Fundies\" who would like to nit-pick will tell you that this is inaccurate, because he didn't return on a great horse, and didn't judge the world; didn't make himself seen by the whole world at his arrival. There is nothing anywhere that says he can't appear to somebody to see them through a hard time in their life, in preparation for the \"Great White Throne Judgement.\" He was ready, but willing to back off if anything could avert it. And, why not a regular, nondescript woman for the fate of the world to hinge upon? That kind of reasoning would think, \"What? A stable? The King Of Kings wouldn't be born in a filthy stable!\" When you listen to someone criticize, consider who is criticizing, and how they are doing it; it puts the whole argument into perspective.\n\nOne scene, a very important scene, one that any \"Christian\" should take note of, has the Jesus character visiting the retarded boy in his jail cell shortly before his scheduled execution. This was obviously a death-penalty state, the law of the land for a capital crime prescribing capital punishment, and while this condemned boy was praying in his cell for forgiveness, Jesus himself appeared to him. And without a word, he placed his hand on his shoulder, looking at him as an understanding father would, as if to say \"I know your heart, and I forgive you.\" It's a moving scene.\n\nIt's not the events themselves in this story that should be seen as central, the timing of such events could arouse interest in observant people, and in this story, it would be God's creation suffering \"labor pains\" as the character portrayed by Demi Moore was experiencing said pains.\n\nThe imagery in this film is a character itself, central to it as any of the actors, scenes of dead soldiers and civilians a reminder of how \"evolved\" we are in today's world. There's a lot to be taken from this film, if you would only watch it as a story of sacrifice and devotion, and not one of religious dogma.\n\nAs a P.S.; The last book of the New Testament is called \"Revelation.\" It's singular, there's no final \"s,\" it's \"The Revelation To John,\" if you want to get technical. It's not called \"Revelations.\"","summary":"INTENSE","unixReviewTime":1121817600,"vote":17.0,"image":null}
