It is one that I well remember from my own childhood and purchased for my daughter who loves it.\n\nIt is about a king who has trouble with rude mice eating his cheese. He consults his wise men and they suggest cats to chase away the mice. The cats become a nuisance, so the wise men recommend the king bring in dogs to chase the cats away.  The cycle goes on until the mice are finally brought back to chase away the elephants, brought in to chase away the lions that'd chased away the dogs.\n\nThe story ends in compromise and friendship between the mice and the king.  The story also teaches cause and effect relationships.\n\nThe pictures that accompany the story are humorous and memorable.  I was thrilled to discover that it is back in print.  I *highly* recommend it for children ages 2 to 7.","summary":"A story children will love and learn from","unixReviewTime":1112140800,"vote":null,"image":null}

And I let the fish go.\" Kentucky Belle. The Battle of Bunker Hill. Wynken, Blynken and Nod. Short, funny poems by Ogden Nash. The Blind Men and the Elephant. Abou Ben Adhem - may his tribe increase! So many wonderful poems are in this book.\n\nMy old book had fallen apart. I work at a school where bookbinding classes were taught. I brought my book in, and got it fixed.\n\nNow, just last week, although I never got to have children myself, life has given me the amazing gift of two little great granddaughters, ages five and eight. What better gift for them than this book, where they will be able to be enchanted by poetry as I was, to grow with it, and they can read the poem that great-grandpa recited by heart after he got married for the second time, way back before they were born.\n\nI am so grateful to see this book on Amazon.

That is because while the book is written by Dr. Seuss it features the jolly drawings of the English artist Quentin Blake.  Until this point every time I have read a book written by Dr. Seuss it was also illustrated by Dr. Seuss and when somebody else did the drawings Dr. Seuss used the name Theo. LeSieg (which is \"Geisel\" backwards).  So the fact that this is a real \"Dr. Seuss\" book drawn by somebody else is pretty special.\nThis Bright and Early Book provides rhymed text and illustrations introducing the many meanings of the word \"up\" as Seuss and Blake show beginning readers that this is a \"Great day for up!\"  You get the point half way through the book but little kids should be able to hand on longer, especially when they are reading the book for themselves.  Besides, by the end of \"Great Day for Up\" we get to the point where \"EVERYONE on Earth is up!\" (with one very important and rather ironic exception).\nAs with all of the Bright and Early Books for Beginning Beginners what you have here is a brief and funny story, where the words are few and easy, there is a catchy rhythm, and the pictures are happy and colorful clues to the text.  These are designed for an even lower age group than the Bright and Early Books that followed \"The Cat in the Hat,\" which was the \"Harry Potter\" of its day when it came to encouraging even pre-schoolers to discover the delights of reading for themselves.  This is not one of the most interesting volumes in the series, but overall these books were a delight.","summary":"Dr. Seuss let's somebody else draw his book on \"Up\"","unixReviewTime":1087776000,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

There is a terrific amount of repetition, and the cleverness in the rhyming and pictures is not \"Up!\" to par with other Dr. Seuss books.\nMy 6-month old children are too young to understand this book, but I think that Mommy and Daddy will tire of the book long before they have gotten the very simple and trivial message in this book : what is the difference between Up and Down ...","summary":"A below-average Dr. Seuss Book","unixReviewTime":1021680000,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

Dr. Seuss has written a book here to can allow you to help your child understand that problem by looking at what \"up\" can mean in different contexts.  The beautiful watercolor and inked outline illustrations by Quentin Blake provide great context for these meanings.\n\"Up! Up!  The sun is getting up.\nThe sun gets up\nso UP with you!\"\nThus, this book begins.  You can see that Dr. Seuss has already connected the idea of the sun rising above the horizon in the east with your rising from your bed.  The book goes on to explore all the things that can rise.  These includes ears on a rabbit, hands, whiskers, and eyes.\nOnce he goes into eyes, he then points out that many living creatures have eyes (including worms, frogs, butterflies, whales, and insects).\nThen, Dr. Seuss returns to \"up\" and gives new meanings.  These include taking something from a lower position to a higher one (like putting your feet up by walking on your hands), throwing things into the air (like balls), guiding things into the air (like kites), climbing (like going up a mountain -- Mt. Dill-ma-dilts in this case), and building mechanisms that can go up (like an elevator or a ferris wheel).\nThen, he returns ingeniously to the original concept of arising from bed:\n\"Wake ever person,\npig and pup,\ntill EVERYONE\non Earth is up!\"\nThen comes the surprise ending that will keep you and your child chuckling for years.\nAt first, you may just think the ending is there simply for humor, but it actually extends your child's understanding of what saying \"up\" means in terms of cause and effect.\nThe book has all of the qualities I look for in an early reader.  The language is simple.  There is a limited vocabulary of short words.  The illustrations tie in clearly to the words.  The story is interesting, humorous, and upbeat.  A child can learn to recognize the key word, up, in just a few readings.\nAfter your child has mastered this wonderful story, I suggest that you encourage your child to use this book to identify synonyms for \"up\" which will extend the value of the book.  For example, you can use \"arise\" or \"rise\" in many of the contexts.  Then you can discuss how a speaker or a writer chooses which word version of a concept to use.\nMay all of your child's learning experiences be UP to the ones available in this book!","summary":"Explores the Many Meanings of the Word, Up","unixReviewTime":982972800,"vote":23.0,"image":null}

Nicholas","reviewText":"This is one of those books that purports to be about something, and at some levels is actually about something pretty much unrelated. The next most important industry after oil in the Middle East is carpets. The author, Kremmer, is a journalist who spent a decade travelling around the region, reporting on various events for Australian new agencies of one sort or another. This is his story of his love affair with carpets, which turns into a pretty serious study of their styles, manufacture, sale and trade, and of the significance of these items in Muslim culture. While the oil is irrelevant to Muslims, except in terms of the money it generates, carpets can tell a lot about the heritage of the Muslim world.\n\nFor the most part, this is interesting, and there's a lot to learn about Muslims and carpets. Only towards the end of the book does the author begin to veer into actual politics, and then, of course, he turns out to think that American policy in the Middle East is too agressive (this was late in the Clinton years...one shudders to think what his opinions are now). Thankfully, he at least hates Saddam Hussein and the mullahs who run Iran (journalists typically don't like governments that restrict freedom of the press, regardless of whatever else they do).\n\nThis one proviso aside, there's a lot of intersting material here, and the book is well-written, the characters drawn interestingly, and the settings well-rendered. I would recommend this book.","summary":"Unusual look at the Middle East","unixReviewTime":1137369600,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

As such, a traversal of the routes and bazaars that comprise the carpet trade would take one through many of the important places in Central Asia.  Likewise, dealing with those involved in the trade would give insight into the history, economics and culture of those living in this area.  This then is the subject of this book.\n\nThe author travels the bazaars and trade routes of Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Kashmir looking for carpets.  While doing so, his interactions with the locals open up a whole world of history, culture, religion, food, and habits that are alien to those in the west.  Whether it is how to barter over goods, or the proper way to greet an older woman, the stories told by Mr. Kremmer bring to life places that many of us will never visit, yet that comprises a large part of this world both spatially and historically.\n\nThe author intersperses his accounts with character studies of the various individuals he meets, side stories to fill in local histories, and editorials that connect what he seens in these far-off places to what occurs in Washington D.C. and the stockmarkets of the West.  Overall, a great travel book, a great history book, and a great story that is told.  I highly recommend this book.","summary":"Tourism as history","unixReviewTime":1136505600,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

Bigelow","reviewText":"The Carpet Wars is a sampler of informal writing from Australian journalist (and avid carpet collector) Christopher Kremmer over ten years in Central Asia.  Since most of it was written, and concerns events, before 9\/11, when the area was not established in the West's cultural radar as it is today, it gives a view of the region that is uncluttered by hindsight reevaluations.\nKremmer writes of his time in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tajikstan, Kashmir, and Iran, giving us colorful and non-journalistic slices of life from each region.  He enlivens his writings with vivid character studies of those he met on his travels, from dignitaries like ill-fated Afghan dictator Mohammed Najibullah and legendary guerilla Ahmad Shah Massoud to various carpet dealers Kremmer got to know over his time in the region.  Between these character sketches and Kremmer's anecdotes, he delivers measured doses of regional history and politics, and he imparts a surprising amount of information about his favorite hobby, the Asian carpet.\nThe result is more than just some very entertaining travel writing.  Kremmer's lively and discursive work also functions as an excellent introduction to the Central Asian economy and politics.  Besides being for those who just like to read about travel in interesting foreign parts, The Carpet Wars will also be useful for non-scholars who want to have some idea how movements like the Taliban came to be, but want to take a spoonful of sugar with this medicine.\n(Kremmer's book also taught me that I'll never know enough to bargain effectively for an Asian carpet -- but his rueful and wry work also admits that there is a certain pleasure in being cheated.)","summary":"Painless Education","unixReviewTime":1089244800,"vote":9.0,"image":null}

Both extremes can get tiring pretty quickly.\nThe Carpet Wars was exactly in the middle, and it was fascinating. It was extremely informative about the history, politics, religion and, yes, even the carpets of the region from Pakistan to Iran.  Carpets were merely the thread (so to speak) that held the several first-hand accounts of travels to the region.\nKremmer is a master story teller, and very funny.  Sometimes it was hard to tell what was more enjoyable, the story he was telling or the way he was telling it.\nHis accounts of places with which he is very familiar are told in the rich tones of a deep affection.  When he is in a new place, like Isfahan, the account is in the vivid colors of someone seeing something for the first time, creating some of the best travel essays I have ever read. Seven weeks ago, Isfahan was just an exotic name to me, now it's at the top of places I hope I can see before I die.\nIts hard to say what recommends this book more, the fact that it is throughly enjoyable, or deeply infomrative.\nI haven't read Mr. Kremmer's book about Laos, but it is probably pretty good.

Gray","reviewText":"Anyone interested in the fine art of rug weaving, the cultures in which Oriental carpets originate, the geography of ancient trade routes including The Silk Road, the history, economics and politics of the Middle East, and present day travel through the strife-torn region will find immense treasure in Christopher Kremmer's The Carpet Wars.  \"The early Muslims inhabited lands where people were born on carpets, prayed on them, and covered their tombs with them.  For centuries, carpets have been a currency and an export, among the first commodities of a globalized trading system\" writes the author, who has spent ten years in Asia reporting for the Australian press.  He uses Oriental rugs as his motif for writing about his travels in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, Tajikistan, Kashmir, and the former Soviet satellite countries of Central Asia.  {Here, this reviewer admits his interest enfolds some bias because of my own travels through the region as a Peace Corps worker in less turbulent times.  Also, I have the good fortune of working in a store where a wide variety of the very finest examples of Oriental carpets are sold.}\n In this book we read that second only to oil, hand made carpets are the region's principal export and were so long before Marco Polo made his famous travels along the Silk Road.  Carpets created by various quarreling factions from the Middle and Near East are the focus for retelling how the fighting clans have damaged the carpet trade, effectively wiping out the middle and upper class of society, and left appalling poverty and misery in its wake.  Kremmer describes how that even in the midst of war and turmoil, a bazaar will spring up during breaks in the fighting and the carpet merchants will quickly resume business as if nothing had happened.  A disappointment for me was that the author omits a description of the many varieties and techniques of rug making; he remains focused on his travels through the Islamic world, giving us the benefit of his first hand witness to the misery.\n Believing that only Allah can create anything perfect, the Muslim carpet makers often will deliberately craft a minor flaw in their handiwork that only a practiced eye might discern.  Also, we learn that many rugs woven by people living under the duress of conflict will reflect their anxieties and turmoil through the symbols of war - airplanes, helicopters, tanks, and guns.  But the rugs also will contain symbols of their makers' traumatic lives not altogether discernible or understood.  Like the great paintings of the Renaissance, these works of art may never be fully comprehended.  It is enough that fortunate owners of hand knotted and woven rugs might appreciate not only their beauty but also how they portray the soulful deeper meaning of the lives of their creators, leaving a legacy for generations to come.  This book is an armchair journey of immense interest.

The largest, and first, section, is an account of events in Afghanistan, which he has witnessed first-hand as a foreign correspondent.\nThis book is no dry history, nor is it merely a travelogue, nor is it merely an extended piece of journalism.\nKremmer comes to know and befriend people of different backgrounds within the region, and it is their stories, as well as the carpet trade and stories of emblematic carpets, through which the narrative is woven. We care about the future of the peoples of the region, because we care about what becomes of Kremmer's friends.\nWhat Christopher has managed to do is to make the internecine politics, the inhumanities, the brutalities, comprehensible, through his humanisation of peoples who might in lesser hands be reduced to the merely 'exotic' or even worse 'unknowable and inhuman'.\nEarlier this year I read 'Unexpected Light: Travels in Afghanistan' by Jason Elliot.\nI thoroughly recommend both these books if you desire to reach some understanding of a region of such importance to us all.","summary":"A compelling read","unixReviewTime":1039219200,"vote":17.0,"image":null}

I'm not sure if he's running out of steam, or if the life stories of Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee don't allow much development at this point.  The dense subplotting and evocative details about Navajo life, so evident in the best Leaphorn\/Chee stories, are mostly missing here.  Hillerman seems to have been motivated mainly by a desire to wrap up the Jim Chee\/Bernie Manuelito relationship, which he does, but not in a particularly original way.  If you are new to this series, try the books written in the 1980's to get a better sense of Hillerman's considerable talent; The Dark Wind is probably the best of the best.","summary":"OK, but far from Hillerman's best","unixReviewTime":1052697600,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

This one involves a somewhat more complex plot than most of the previous ones, and as for character development, Mr. Hillerman seems to take it for granted that the readers of this book have also read at least some of the others, and that therefore he does not need to go into too much detail as to the personalities of his characters.  Having said that, though, I enjoyed the book very much, and my only real complaint is, as with \"The Wailing Wind\", it is, at about 230 pages, just too short.  But it is always a rare treat to be reunited with our old friends from the Navajo Tribal Police, and as an added bonus this edition features a happy ending romantically for the ever-lovelorn Jim Chee.  Here's hoping Mr. Hillerman keeps the Leaphorn\/Chee series coming, and that he adds a hundred or so pages to his next tale.","summary":"Another Fine (If Too Brief) from Tony Hillerman","unixReviewTime":1052524800,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

The early books were traditional police procedurals set in the unique environment and society of the Navajo Reservation.  The crimes that led to murder were relatively small in magnitude: stealing Indian artifacts, robbing a casino, or revenge.  In recent Hillerman books, the crimes have grown in scope to encompass serial killing, international drug smuggling, and theft of billions of dollars worth of natural gas.  Bigger is not necessarily better.  The Sinister Pig seems closer to Ludlum that to early Hillerman.\nA CIA expert on middle eastern oil pipeline technology is murdered while on a freelance investigation for a US Senator in the Four Corners area.  Both Chee and the local FBI agent are quickly frozen out of the investigation by FBI headquarters.  Chee continues to probe for information with help from the retired Leaphorn, \"Cowboy\" Dashee (now a BLM law enforcement officer), and Bernie Manuelito who has joined the US Customs Border Patrol.\nAs in Wailing Wind, Bernie is the pivotal character in the story.  Through her eyes Hillerman shows the reader how the US Government goes about trying to interdict illegal immigration and drug trafficking on the border with Mexico.  It is not pretty.  Chee is as inept as ever in dealing with his romantic interest in Bernie.  While there were genuine obstacles to overcome in Chee's earlier love affairs, his inability to make his true feelings known to Ms Manuelito seems merely callow.\nWe know who the villain of the piece is almost from the outset.  He not only has the CIA agent killed, but arranges to have a young congrssional aide he has impregnated vanish.  Lacking the whodunit element, the reader has only suspense to fuel his interest.\nHillerman's descriptive skill is as sharp as ever and his ear for dialogue as true.  Leaphorn is still Leaphorn.  Should we ask for anything more?","summary":"HEAVY ON SUSPENSE -- LIGHT ON MYSTERY","unixReviewTime":1052438400,"vote":4.0,"image":null}
{"overall":4,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"05 7, 2003","reviewerID":"A9ANMVCEOQ8P7","asin":"0002005263","style":{"Format:":" Hardcover"},"reviewerName":"Bruce Trinque","reviewText":"\"The Sinister Pig\" is another in Hillerman's long-running series of mystery novels centering upon the now retired, but hardly inactive, Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn and Sergeant Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police.  This time the plot is in part inspired by the continuing scandal over the mismanagement - embezzlement and outright theft may be closer to the point - of funds due to Southwest Indian tribes for oil, gas, and coal taken from their reservations under Federal auspices.  An investigator sent by a powerful Washington, DC, senator to nose around turns up dead with a bullet in his back.  It is Jim Chee's case - or at least as much of the case as the FBI will let him handle - but it is immediately clear that somebody with high connections back in Washington wants the investigation squelched.\nMeanwhile, Jim Chee has something else on his mind.  Bernadette Manuelito, formerly an officer in the Navajo Tribal Police, has taken a new job with the Border Patrol, 200 miles away, just when Chee was working up his resolve to make his personal interest clear to her.  And now Bernie has stumbled on some mysterious goings-on along the Mexican border that might tie in to the unsolved murder back home.\nHillerman departs somewhat from his usual format by writing several chapters from outside the viewpoint of Leaphorn and Chee (and Bernie Manuelito).  Unlike in most Hillerman novels, we very quickly learn who the bad guys are, although a mystery remains until the final chapters as to exactly what they are doing.  In general Hillerman's villains are not especially villainous, their motivations often arising from quite ordinary circumstances that lead them into crimes they never intended.  But in \"The Sinister Pig\" the chief villain is as close to plain evil as Hillerman is ever likely to get.\nOne disappointment: an element which usually sets Hillerman's mystery novels apart from all others is their exploration of the culture and religion of the Navajos and their Indian neighbors, this being integral to the book plot and often crucial to the solution of the mystery at hand.  In the present novel we see almost nothing of this, except for some peripheral matters that only touch upon Jim Chee himself.  Washington powerbrokers are a less engaging group than the people of the Big Rez.\n\"The Sinister Pig\" is not the best of Hillerman, to be sure, and it might be argued that it works primarily as simply being part of a continuing series about characters to whom we have come to feel close over the years.  But a Hillerman book that is not amongst his best work is still a good mystery.  And readers who count Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee as literary friends will want to find what has now happened in their personal lives.\nHillerman's Navajo novels have continuing background stories that develop from novel to novel over time.  Therefore, readers new to Hillerman would be well advised to begin not with this latest novel but back at the beginning of the series, getting to know the characters as their lives evolve.  There's plenty of good reading to be had along the way.","summary":"Good, but not the best Hillerman","unixReviewTime":1052265600,"vote":46.0,"image":null}

I'm a pretty dedicated library user as well.\n\nI've long been a fan of the American Southwest.  It is one of my favorite places to visit and vacation.  I've also been aware that Tony Hillerman - a name that any bibliophile should recognize - writes mysteries set in the American Southwest.  So why haven't I read his works before this? Mostly I think it's because I've only recently developed an affection for the mystery\/thriller genre.\n\nAlthough sixteenth in a series, I don't get the impression that reading the previous fifteen books in a necessity to enjoy this.  The reader is likely to understand some of the character relationships that have developed over the course of the series, but the story itself seems to be contained within the covers.\n\nBernadette \"Bernie\" Manuelito once worked for the Tribal Police but now is a Border Patrol\/Customs Officer.  She quickly develops a reputation for herself and while helping out some stranded border-crossers, she is told that a photo of her has been circulating around Mexico, identifying her as potentially dangerous and someone the criminals might want to be rid of. She becomes a target when she visits an exotic game ranch which was once a station for a gas pipeline.  Unknown to Bernie, but figuring it out when he learns she's become a target, is Sergeant Jim Chee, who is madly in love with Bernie.  The old pipe lines might be in use to smuggle something in to the country. But knowing what is being smuggled and who is the force (and money) behind the operation, is something that brings even more danger to Bernie, Chee, and Joe Leaphorn.\n\nI found this to be pretty standard (and average) mystery\/thriller fare. The bad guys were appropriately bad, but they also seemed sort of 'Bond' bad - stereotyped bad guys.  Wealthy, white, powerful, connected.\n\nI found the set-up really interesting and the regular characters pretty believable and worth following for a couple more books at least, but I was disappointed in the 'resolution' of the story.  I'm not real fond of the deus ex machina  ending or the dumb luck\/getting out of a jam because of something or someone completely outside of the protagonists control.\n\nAs I say, this was pretty average.  It often felt very dated, not just but how characters were acting, but how they were being portrayed.  I'll read a few more and see how I feel about the series.\n\nLooking for a good book?  <em>The Sinister Pig<\/em> by Tony Hillerman is a pretty average mystery set in the American Southwest.","summary":"A rather average mystery.","unixReviewTime":1494374400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Tony Hillerman certainly can tell a story, and although this one is only on Navajo land for a short time as the scene for the murder which opens the book, Hillerman does an excellent job of re-setting the scene in southernmost New Mexico as Officer Bernie Manueliti leaves the Tribal Police for a new job with the US Border Patrol. Cowboy Dashie and Joe Leaphorn play their usual solid key roles, a rogue pilot\/political henchman adds a great deal to the plot, an evil villain gets what he deserves, but the steady and taciturn Jim Chee is instead portrayed as a bumbling idiot, especially when facing his feelings for Manuelito. All the parts of the plot make sense and intersect nicely, the title fits nicely, but unfortunately there is very little authentic Navajo lore to add to the atmosphere. That is usually a highlight in a Hillerman novel, and I missed that. I still would have given the book 4 stars, if it weren't for the really weak \"romance\" between Chee and Manuelito. It never felt real or genuine, and its lame, sobbing 1950s-style resolution should make every female reader shake her head in despair.

But it's these very qualities that seem to get her in difficulties. Now she's no longer a cop working for Sergeant Chee at Shiprock. Partly to forget Chee, who's failing to get romantic, she takes a job on the Mexican border. There she encounters some shady characters and dicey situations on a mysterious ranch stocked with exotic game animals.\n\nChee meanwhile is occupied with a mysteriously well-dressed unidentified dead body. Leaphorn too gets involved in this case.  But neither is too busy to worry about Bernie and get involved in her complications.\n\nBernie gets a quick education on border patrolling, and so do we. There is a wonderfully despicable villain in the plot, and an unexpected hero.\n\nChee's best friend Cowboy Dashee also plays a role. He's an Apache and prone to poke fun at Navajos, the heredity enemy of his tribe. His quips are always amusing.\n\nThe Leaphorn and Chee mysteries are consistently delightful, with clever plots, tense action, engaging characters, terrific atmosphere, and always a fascinating picture of Native American culture in New Mexico.\n\nBut I will add that my husband, a fellow Hillerman fan, found this book a bit weak with the contrivance of too many coincidences. I also read in a book by Anne Hillerman that The Sinister Pig gave Hillerman the most trouble of all his books, because he was less familiar with the location. I love these books so much that I'm not critical of the contrivances.

This book centers on Chee's new love, Officer Bernadette Manuelito, once a member of the Navajo police force.  As the book opens, Bernie, as she's called, has transferred to the Border Patrol.  She's miserable because she misses Chee, but he had never told her how he felt about her, so she left . . .  Well, it's an old story.\n\nMeanwhile, Chee is agonizing about her being gone, but doesn't want to pick up the phone and call her or go to see her because she might tell him to get lost or . . .  Yeah, an old story.\n\nWith this kind of start, a reader might think it's going to be the old saw about the man rescuing his lovely girlfriend, realizing how much he loves her, and they live happily ever after.  Well, not quite.\n\nGetting to the end of this tale, however, is far from a straight line as Hillerman concentrates on one plot point, then another, then another.  It would seem that he heard about how the \"pig\" is used to clean pipelines and decided it would make a good story.  It certainly is the centerpiece of this story.  Oh, that and a hit man who . . .  Mustn't give that away either.\n\nFor all its seeming shortcomings, The Sinister Pig provides bits of Leaphorn and Chee for diehard Hillerman fans to enjoy and descriptions of New Mexico to ponder.  It's short and a quick read, more a novella really, while not fully satisfying, not terribly disappointing either.","summary":"And the hero is . . .","unixReviewTime":1317686400,"vote":null,"image":null}

In some ways, I'd agree. It's certainly different, in important respects, from his other mysteries set in the Four Corners region. Primarily, it lacks the anthropological focus that's helped to make Hillerman's mysteries so unique and enjoyable over the years. The Native American cultures, which provide surprising depth to the characters as they negotiate their identities up against their traditions, and which also establish the cosmic setting in which the events of the novel are understood, are only hinted at in the novel. Not even the title is drawn from Native American mythology; it's a term borrowed from the oiling industry. So, there's no doubt that a large part of the formula that has produced Hillerman's success is lacking. That's worth knowing going into the book.\n\nBut that said, I still enjoyed The Sinister Pig, just for different reasons than normal. The book is pretty well-plotted, as is usual for Hillerman. I've really thought that some of the the complaints against the plot I've read (i.e. having a good idea of the who masterminded the crime early on) were oversold, since those elements tend to appear in other Hillerman novels. The Sinister Pig's plot, though not as complex as always, is perfectly sensible and features a fine red herring. Mainly, though, I enjoyed the book because the rest of the series has taught me to admire and care for Hillerman's characters, especially for Jim Chee and Bernie Manuelito here, and The Sinister Pig features important progress for them. That's the main thing that's different about The Sinister Pig. Hillerman has always used anthropology and myth to augment and enrich the mysteries, and that's gotten him his audience. Here, however, he'a a little more traditional, using simple romance, instead, as the special extra ingredient. That switch will leave many Hillerman fans less satisfied with this volume, and The Sinister Pig is also not the place to begin reading Hillerman. But I certainly thought it was fine for a change. I enjoyed it as a solid and light little mystery that also brought about some pleasant developments for two of my favorite characters.","summary":"Enjoyable...But for Different Reasons than Usual","unixReviewTime":1309651200,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

He is murdered on Navajo land in the extreme northwestern corner of New Mexico.  Navajo Tribal Policeman (Sargent) Jim Chee is assigned to assist the FBI in the investigation.  In the meantime Bernadette Manualetto has resigned from the tribal police, because she is annoyed with Chee for not pursuing her, and has joined (implausibly) the Border Patrol, and thus is stationed in the extreme southwestern corner of New Mexico, along the Mexican border.  She observes some odd \"goings-on\" on the large private Tuttle Ranch on the border.  That's the setup.\n\nCOMMENTS\nEarlier novels in the series were very \"economical\", with a few well developed characters, and straightforward filler-free stories.  With the previous novel, \"Wailing Wind\", and even more-so with the \"Sinister Pig\". Hillerman is (unfortunately?) entering the mainstream of police mystery novels, with dozens of named characters, most throw-away (i.e., that appear on one or two pages, never to be heard from or of again, with no particular significance to the novel); and complex plots.  The stories are no longer about Native Americans, but rather are about \"white people\" who coincidentally interact somehow with Jim Chee, et al.  The fascinating expositions on Native religion and philosophy is over, except for thin references.  Fortunately, Hillerman is sufficiently talented to keep up with mainstream mystery writers.  But I, for one, miss the earlier character-centric and Native-centric novels.\n\nCAVEATS\nThe novel is unnecessarily confused by two premises:  1) The first is that pipelines were being used in the rip-off of Native American royalties.  That simply makes no sense---the routing of petroleum in pipelines is irrelevant, just as irrelevant as the highways a petroleum tanker truck drives on.  It is in the accounting that any rip-offs of Native American royalties could have taken place.  2) The second premise is a cocaine importation scheme.  It looks like these two storylines were intended to converge, but don't.\n\nOther evidence of rushed, poorly-edited writing, are redundancies, such as the multiply repeated explaination of the functioning of pipeline pigs.\n\nReaders are teased with the promise of a delicious expose of political corruption, then perhaps a scheme by Al Queda to smuggle nuclear weapons into the U.S., but are finally left with a few sleazy druggies.  Certainly, when you start turning over rocks, the slimy creatures you find are not necessarily the ones you were looking for, but, in the final analysis there was no adequate reason for the murder of Slate\/Stein.\n\nMoreover, unless I misread the book, the illegal-alien family which Bernie rescued had immigrated on rumors that a copper smelter on the U.S. side of the border would be reopened.  (The fictional smelter closely corresponds to the Hildalgo Smelter, which was closed in 1999.  ironically the company town of Playas was purchased by the U.S. Government for an anti-terrorism training center).  Then the closed smelter is described as being located in Mexico, and is the origin from which \"pigs\" are transported to the Tuttle Ranch on the U.S. side of the border.  Huh?\n\nTHE VERDICT\nA good read in a great series, but unnecessarily confusing.\n\n> Click on Stoney just below the product title to see my other reviews, or leave a comment to ask a question.","summary":" The Slimy Pig","unixReviewTime":1260576000,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

His series of detective novels, following first the adventures of two different characters, Lt. Joe Leaphorn and Sgt. Jim Chee, in separate books. Later, Hillerman combined the two characters, and has been chronicling their combined adventures for a good long time now. He's added supporting characters, including a series of girlfriends for Chee, a wife who died and then a lady friend for Leaphorn, and colleagues like the inimitable Cowboy Dashee, who's appeared in the background of several of the books.\n\nThis latest entry in the series isn't the strongest, but it is interesting. Someone's been killed on the Reservation, and before anyone can investigate, the FBI shows up and closes down the investigation, announcing the improbably verdict of \"hunting accident\". Chee doesn't buy the explanation, and both he and Leaphorn take to investigating on their own. Meanwhile, a former colleague of theirs, Bernadette Manuelito, has gone to work for the Border Patrol. While there, she discovers things which seem to link into the investigation on the Reservation that Chee and Leaphorn are running.\n\nI enjoyed this book well enough.

We are introduced to a nearly retired CIA agent.  He is, apparently, the star of the book.  But no, he's not.  Boom, he's gone.\n\nThe rest of the story has to play out without the main character.  It is one of the oddest structured books I've ever come across.  The first character, the one who dominated the first chapter, is gone.  Bye.  See ya.  Now on to someone else.\n\nAnd there is no star after him.  There is a handful of co-stars.  I'm not used to that.  This is very unique in that regard.  Normally, a story has a star.  This one doesn't.\n\nOne drawback with being read to is that we are dependent on the person reading, and we have to listen to him do all the characters.  I don't understand why they don't have a group of people reading, each taking one character.  I'm tired of hearing the guy say \"He said\" over and over.  I'm even more tired of hearing a male voice portray a female character by changing to a really horrible imitation of a female voice.  Couldn't they hire a woman to read with him?  We hear the guy talk in a higher voice.  It is very poorly done.  What else is he going to do?  He can't make himself sound anything like a woman.\n\nThere is only one interesting character in this story.  He is an employee of the sinister pig.  It falls to him to execute innocent girls.  The story progresses in the most expected way.  I could have written parts of the story line.  It is so obvious.  Is this good guy actually going to murder the girls?  Somehow I doubt it.  Are the good guys going to win in the end?  Yeah, I kind of think they will.\n\nSo that's the lowdown on this book.  The people who rated it five stars were overrating it, and the people who rated it one star were underrating it, and you've just read the most definitive and accurate review you'll find on this website.","summary":"Predictable but entertaining enough","unixReviewTime":1157241600,"vote":null,"image":null}

For the most part it reads like a typical Hillerman Leaphorn\/Chee book but with an exception. The story is hurried along after a few chapters. It's like someone was bored and wanted to get the manuscript to the publishers quick and be done with it. All true Hillerman fans will read this book but I believe most will feel a bit cheated. It's a very short read even for a Hillerman.\n\nThe beginning starts out with a perplexing and strange murder to solve but everything is unraveled quickly. I pretty much knew what to expect next from each character. The perfect chance to build suspense and a deep mystery was wasted by letting Joe Leaphorn solve everything way too quickly. It seems Joe only needs a few phone calls and a simple map to solve anything. The usually savy Chee and his intellegent cohort gal, now with another agency, are like bafoons relying mostly on the aging legendary Leaphorn to figure everything out.\n\nIf you're a diehard Leaphorn\/Chee fan like I am, you'll buy the book, even with its dissapointing 'not up to par' story.\n\nIf it's your first one in the series, do yourself a huge favor. Read the first 15 before taking this one on.

I, also like many other reviewers, found __THE SINISTER PIG__ to be a compelling mystery.\nIt carries through many themes from earlier Hillerman mysteries:  We have Sgt. Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police, who is in love with Bernadette \"Bernie\" Manuelito, formerly of the Tribal Police, but now with the Border Patrol.  Chee is afraid to tell her of his feelings for fear of rejection.  We have the aforementioned Bernadette Manuuelito who is in love with Jim Chee, but also is afraid to express her love due to the same fear.  We have the now retired \"legendary Lieutenant\" with his ever-present maps and his analytical mind.  It's always a pleasure to meet these three again.\nWe have a powerful businessman\/criminal with money, political connections, and evil intentions who won't let anything or anyone stand in his way.  We have a couple of ex-C.I.A. agents, one who is operating incognito and is murdered almost as the book opens, and the other who is working for our amoral rich man.\nThrow all of these characters into a pot and mix them with the search for 40 billion or so dollars of missing royalties never paid to various indigenous tribes, the C.I.A. man's murder, and a drug smuggling plot, and you have a mystery (or perhaps mysteries) that requires the best of Leaphorn's analytical abilities and Chee's intuition to begin to get to the bottom of things.\nWell, that's the plot in a nutshell, and it does make a story well worth reading, but, there is something missing that I have come to anticipate in Hillerman's novels.  In the majority of his previous novels, he included, as an integral part of the plots, information that is not widely known about Navajo, or occasionally Hopi, customs, mythological history, and religious rites.  I always felt that I was getting a cultural education as well as reading a good mystery.  This unique aspect of his previous books was missing here, and I, for one, missed that aspect of his knowledge that he usually shares with us.\nEven with the unique aspect of his writing missing, __THE SINISTER PIG__ is a novel worth reading.","summary":"A COMPLEX , SUSPENSEFUL PLOT, BUT . . . . .","unixReviewTime":1087862400,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

This time out, the story is plot-driven and largely takes place off the Four Corners Navajo reservation.  Much time is spent on the \"guest star\" characters and not so much on our old friends.  Thus, there is a thinness to this book despite a plot that starts off ambitiously snuffling up Washington corruption, post 9-11 paranoia, corrupt CEOs, drug smuggling, and other zeitgeist.\nThe good news is, those who have read earlier entries in the series will be amused to find all of the other regulars finally losing patience with Jim Chee's romantic klutziness and variously taking him aside and essentially saying, look here, the time has come to get on with things.  Also, Hillerman takes what might be his best shot yet at satirizing the bureaucracy.  There is a great scene where the FBI, New Mexico State Police, Bureau of Land Management, DEA, and representatives of at least two other agencies are disputing jurisdiction and who should show up but Homeland Security, insisting on authority over everything and everybody.\nA last comment: the hardcover edition is riddled with publishing errors, mostly misplaced punctuation.

Bernadette Manuelito is in physical danger for having stumbled upon and photographed scenes yielding clues to the solution of the mystery.\nFortunately Leaphorn and Chee come to the realization of the danger on time to be of assistance.  The plotting is adroit. The characters, as always, are well drawn.  The theme of the series may very well be Jim Chee's search for a mate.","summary":"Triangulation","unixReviewTime":1068076800,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

Scott","reviewText":"For years, Tony Hillerman has been giving us wonderful plots, intricate characters and breathtaking verbal landscapes. With \"The Sinister Pig,\" unfortunately, it seems Mr. Hillerman is growing tired of his Leaphorn\/Chee series.\n  The plot of \"The Sinister Pig,\" his latest in the series, is promising, but Hillerman seems to have lacked either the energy or the desire to flesh it out into what could have been a fantastic novel. Instead, what we get is a partially realized concept that clocks in at an anemic 240 pages. (And it's 240 heavily padded pages, at that, with blank pages between chapters, large type and heavy leading on the part of the typesetter. Let's face it: This is more a novella masquerading as a novel than the real thing.)\n  The book is also rife with proofing errors, including more missing question marks than one can count and at least one instance in which he accidentally refers to Chee as Leaphorn in mid-scene. That, plus a far-from-satisfying closing, makes \"The Sinister Pig\" feel like a rush job, as if Hillerman was more interesting in finishing this project quickly than crafting a quality piece.\n  Fans of Mr. Hillerman's work have come to expect much more, and they all know he's capable of top-notch fiction.

The novel starts with a preface regarding missing royalties to the Indian Nations as it ties into oil profits and the U.S. government.  While I don't dispute his claims one way or another, Sinister Pig clearly is a vehicle for Hillerman to present his personal viewpoints in a fictional manner and to make the reader really aware of this.\nThe story itself, while good, is missing the magical sense of Navajo country and traditions the readers have come to expect from Hillerman.  Gone are the beautiful descriptions of the four corners area, and the deep culture of the Native Americans.  Instead we find Jim Chee at a mid life crisis, contemplating his life as a bachelor and his love for former Officer Bernie Manuelito.\nJoe Leaphorn is present as well, but his character steps down as a main player to that of the supporting cast.  And while Leaphorn has his momentous 'breakthrough' in the case, his involvement otherwise is minimal.\nHowever, who does step up to the plate is Bernie Manuelito.  Now as a Border Patrol Officer assigned to lower New Mexico, she stumbles across a corrupt department, and some 'fishy' on-goings at the nearby Tuttle Ranch.  Something in regards to drugs, gas and oil pipelines, illegal immigration, the apparent murders of undercover government officials and of course and errant and deviant U.S. government.\nThe novel is pretty fast paced and is a very quick read.  Chapters are small and to the point.  It was a good diversion for a Hillerman book, but I hope this was just a half way point to a much larger novel that will bring our characters back to the forefront of Native American culture and its roots in northern New Mexico.","summary":"Hillerman strays from known territory","unixReviewTime":1064275200,"vote":7.0,"image":null}

It is another superb novel, and nearly on par with his other works. The Sinister Pig offers many characters familiar to  Hillerman's readers. Jim Chee continues to be a main focus, as does his prospective love interest, Bernadette Manuelito, now a novice customs officer working in southern New Mexico. Manuelito stumbles into trouble, drawing Chee and a host of others into the picture.\nNot the least of these others is the \"legendary\" ex-Captain Joe Leaphorn and his new \"sidekick\" character, Dr. Bourbonet. Several new characters - a Guatemalan exile, a Washington DC attorney and an erstwhile law student -- are particular to this story. Still, they're well-written and compelling, and extend the depth of the story past the usual boundaries of a mystery. As the story develops, the reader will notice a series of evolutionary departures from Hillerman's standard fare.\nForemost among these is the fact that story reads less like a mystery than a suspense novel. While it's true that there is a murder, and it is something of a mystery, the good guys and the bad guys all have their identities and roles out on the table pretty early on in the book. From there, the reader gets to anticipate whether the good guys (Chee, Manuelito, Leaphorn and a few others) will find and capture the bad guys before they succeed in any of their nefarious plans. Since the reader knows how the pieces fit together before the characters, the story really revolves around the suspense, rather than the \"whodunit\" aspect of the plot.\nAt the same time, some other changes seem to be brewing in Hillerman's writing. First, while Hillerman has always shifted points of view frequently in his stories, it seems like no point of view is particularly dominant in this book. From my recollection, that's a little different than in his earlier writing. Chee, Manuelito, Leaphorn and three major characters particular to this book all get some time in front of the point-of-view lens. It doesn't hamper the story, but for those used to watching Chee or Leaphorn solve a mystery, it's a little new. The other key difference is that much of this novel takes place off the Navajo reservation that's so familiar to Hillerman readers. While that doesn't hamper the story either, for me it left the novel with a very different feel. Prior works were well-steeped in Navajo (and sometimes Hopi) cultural flavor, and I enjoyed this aspect of his works. That flavor, for me, got largely crowded out by other story elements in this book. It didn't ruin the work, but I did find that I missed that content, and hope he returns to it in the future.\nFar from harming the work, these differences and changes simply present the story in a different light. Sinister Pig is an excellent novel, and well lives up to the expectations that Hillerman's readers have. I give it five stars for it's strong story, good characters and compelling tempo. I don't think readers, whether they've read Hillerman before or not, could be disappointed by this  book.","summary":"Different, But Still Very Good","unixReviewTime":1059004800,"vote":null,"image":null}

As I read the book, however, I began to wonder if it had actually been written by Hillerman.\nThe plot involves Washington, D.C. politicos involved in drug-running between Mexico and the U.S. There is some soap-boxing about missing royalties owed Native American tribes from the U.S. government, and a couple honorable assassins thrown in to spice things up.\nThe setup is interesting enough, with a man sent out to the Four Corners region to do some investigating, shot in the back, and then a follow-up investigation by Sgt. Jim Chee. Meanwhile, Chee's would-be girlfriend has become Border Patrol Officer Manuelito down in the bootheel of New Mexico. In fact, most of the action in the story is done by Bernie, although Leaphorn figures out most of the details with his powers of deduction and a couple maps. Chee just kind of ties things together.\nWhat disappointed me is that although the characters are moving along, the spirit seems to have gone out of Hillerman's writing. The vivid details of the landscape and geography are missing, along with the spirituality of Chee. Most of the Navajo cultural notes that made the earlier novels interesting are just kind of hinted at and it is assumed that the reader has read the other works.

I strongly suspect that this book, which comes so strongly on the heels of  \"The Wailing Wind,\" may well be his last.\n\n  Other reviewers have noted that this book adds nothing new to our understanding of the central characters. But it does leave them with fewer unresolved issues than prior books. Rather than being the cynical money-making effort depicted in some reviews below, this book appears to be a parting gift from an aging author who wanted to give the series a more satisfying closure than \"The Wailing Wind\" had left us with.\n\nThat said, it's not a great stand-alone book. The first chapter, which introduces the retiring CIA agent who will soon become the murder victim, is painfully cliched, seemingly cobbled together from bad spy movies and political thrillers. The mystery is obvious (partly because huge chunks of it are told from the villains' perspective), and except for a little bit of magic with maps, Leaphorn and Chee get no chance to show off their detecting brilliance. The setting, in southern New Mexico's \"boot heel\" region, is rendered generically, without the detail for which Hillerman is famous-as though he'd written it from maps and memory. Plot elements never connect, and there are gaps in the police procedure (most notably involving a car, which is missing in one chapter but has been fingerprinted in another chapter, with no mention that I could find of its being discovered).\n\nThe cobbled-together feel of this book, its lack of complexity, and its short length make me suspect that Hillerman's health is failing and that he rushed it to completion while he still could. Hopefully I'm wrong. Regardless, readers of the series this book should save this book for last-it's merely an epilog to a long and honorable series. If you've read all the books, this one is a must read. If you've not, you'll be disappointed.\n\nAnd if I'm right, thanks Tony, for making the effort to give us a parting gift.","summary":"Series Finale???","unixReviewTime":1058227200,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

This time, however, the plot is so implausible and the writing so flat that it detracted from the usual pleasures.  I also have to say, having lived in Washington, DC for the past 12 years, that I found the portions of the book dealing with DC and federal politics completely absurd.

By the end of the book, I had come to question all his descriptions.\nI also have to agree with all those who criticized the writing in this book.  Many of the scenes read like outlines, particularly in the later chapters.  I've noticed that mystery writers with long established series frequently get lazy with the later books in the series (see Martha Grimes), but I do not understand why the publisher or editor does not insist that sparse scenes be fleshed out and that authors adhere to modicum of versimilitude.

So why the grousing. Perhaps Hillerman fans expected more fireworks after the two most recent clunkers. Or maybe, with the same cast in place, readers expected Hillerman to continue his exploration and exposition of the cultures of the native peoples of the southwest. But as Hillerman moves his action further south, he leaves much of the Navaho ethos behind, and the distinct customs of a people fade as the writer brings the Sonoran landscape to the foreground. Tellingly it is described as even more vacant, more of a vacuum of living things than the \"Four Corners\" setting of earlier novels. Bernie, now with the Customs Patrol carries extra plastic jugs of water in her vehicle, and she will need them as she discovers thirsty illegals stranded in the desert. Principal characters getting lost because of undistinguishable landmarks ( unthinkable on Navaho land ) leads  more than once to important plot turns.

You know he's run out of ideas for his venerable Native American heroes when he's more interested in the villains of the book than the cops.\nThis book, definitely the worst in the series, is as flat as a pancake from start to finish, with a \"mystery\" as complex as an Encyclopedia Brown story. Chee and Leaphorn have basically nothing to do in this story except pass on endless, awkward exposition. Side characters slide in and out with no real purpose. The only cop who Hillerman seems to be interested in, the fetching Bernie Manuelito, becomes a helpless pawn in a macho boy's game of drugs and power. Even Hillerman's trademark Ansel Adams-esque descriptions of the southwestern scenery seem minimized and irrelevant. Hillerman can't even figure out how to end it properly, resorting to a horridly uncharacteristic \"epilogue\" that seems like it was written two hours before deadline.\nThis series really does have a lot of legs in it, but Hillerman no longer seems to have the energy to keep it moving. Perhaps it's time for someone else to take over with Hillerman serving as consultant. Because it would be a shame for Chee and Leaphorn to continue on the downward spiral that has plagued Hillerman's most recent efforts.","summary":"A Thief of My Time...","unixReviewTime":1055808000,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

Some familiar characters, a murder and related violence, short chapters, almost continual action and extremely limited character development. (Eliminate the many blank pages between chapters and it is barely two hundred small pages of large type. Thus, it is overpriced.)\nThe story has great potential. It has the well known characters of Sergeant Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police and Bernie Manuelito, now separated geograpically from Chee as a rookie Border Patrol officer and with the future of their relationship in doubt. When a puzzling murder in Chee's jurisdiction intersects with Bernie's work, the retired \"Legendary Lieutenant \" Joe Leaphorn is called upon for consultation. At the same time there seems to be a puzzling interest emanating from a powerful source in Washington, D.C. concerning the ramifications of the case.\nThere is an intimation that the dead man may have been investigating the actual scandal concerning the loss (probably due to a combination of theft, embezzlement, indifference and incompetence) of billions of dollars of royalties from the Indian Tribal Royalty Fund held in trust by the Department of the Interior. This is a topic with great potential for an author with Hillerman's skills and knowledge, but it becomes peripheral to a pretty standard police procedural combined with the mystery of how the romance between Bernie and Jim will conclude. There is some excellent misdirection regarding both the nature of the underlying crinimal activity and its participants and who or what is the real \"SINISTER PIG\". But a lot of the oppportunities to develop the potential plot complications and resultant suspense were simply never pursued. Also, there were several loose ends that were never satisfactorily tied up despite the attempt to do so in the epilogue. (I cannot go into details without revealing too much of the plot.) It is almost as if Hillerman had an outline for a wonderfully complex story and then decided it was too complicated and so decided to quickly bring this part of the story to a close and leave the rest for a sequel.\nAs the title of my review implies, a few elements helped me decide to generously round up my rating to three stars. First, the plot is clever, and there is sufficient misdirection to keep the reader's interest. Second, it involves familiar characters. Third, this is a incredibly fast read. It is definitely a book for a short trip or a rainy afternoon. So if you are a Hillerman fan, lower your expectations and enjoy a few hours updating yourself on the latest happenings in New Mexico.","summary":"(2 1\/2) A Disappointing Effort Saved By An Ingenious Plot","unixReviewTime":1055721600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Bates","reviewText":"For the dedicated Hillerman reader, this latest may be disappointing.  We have become accustomed to excellent mysteries which are also anthropology lessons.  In almost if not every story of Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee, Tony Hillerman has presented his readers with lessons about many facets of the southwestern Native American culture, the problems this culture faces.  This novel is more a straight thriller, without significant overtones of cultural stress and adaptation.  The basic plot line does have a Native American connection.  It seems that the Department of the Interior is responsible for a trust fund for Native Americans.  The trust is where royalties and other payments for oil, gas, timber, and other sales from reservation lands are deposited so that the money can be used for the benefit of the tribes.  It also seems that tens of billions of dollars which should be in the trust are not, and there doesn't seem to be any explanation.  A senator hires a retiring CIA specialist in pipelines to investigate what is happening in the \"four-corners\" territory, especially as it related to activities of a billionaire recluse who may be dabbling in hard drugs as well as petroleum.  The implication is that the billionaire is diverting gas and oil from the pipeline and avoiding paying royalties-or anything else.  The covert investigator is found murdered on the reservation and Jim Chee is the investigating officer.  But the FBI claims jurisdiction, transfers case management to Washington, and then stonewalls.  Chee wonders why the apparent cover-up and keeps on digging.  Enough waves are made that DC people involved in investigating the trust fund situation wonder if there is a connection and ask Joe Leaphorn, now retired, to look into the case.  What follows is a very good thriller, with unlikely \"heroes\" and bad guys getting their just desserts.  The implications of Washington insider conspiracies are raised but never resolved; yet, while not quite up to Hillerman's stories which do have stronger cultural lessons, this is a very good book.  PS: the sinister pig is not Native American but pipeline related.  Read the book to find out what the title reference is about.","summary":"Different, But Not Boaring","unixReviewTime":1055721600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Altizer","reviewText":"OK, I thought, \"The Wailing Wind\" was an aberration, a hiccup in the career of a very good author.  But two points define a line, and \"The Sinister Pig\" plots Mr. Hillerman's career straight down.  In the corporate world you sometimes see a luminary from an earlier era who is \"RIP\" -- retired in place -- just going through the motions, living on past glories and collecting the big bucks for his reputation, not his current work.  Sadly, this describes Tony Hillerman, who has decided to stir around a few ashes, thow in a highly predictable conclusion, and call it a novel.  I bet he's laughing at his readers all the way to the bank.\nAs for the book itself, reviewers occasionally describe a film as \"OK for a 10-minute sketch on SNL, but not a 90-minute feature.\"  That's Sinister Pig for you: interesting premise but almost no plot or character development (call central casting for all the stereotypes), no suspense (you know from the start who's really a bad guy and who's really not), and the shallowest of literary style (like Wailing Wind, everyone is constantly \"grinning\" at everyone else).  The initial plot device, investigating diversion of Indian royalty payments, is both interesting and topical -- it's really happening -- but couldn't lead to a facile wrap-up in a mere 224 pages, so Mr. Hillerman switches to just another standard contraband tale.  Rest assured, the good guys prosper, the bad guys pay, and the bad guys who are really good guys ... well, what do you expect?\nI did like the little polemics on stealing of Indian royalties, the vested interest of both narcos and narcs in keeping the \"War on Drugs\" going full steam, and the pervasiveness of corruption in high office, but they weren't enough to salvage an otherwise trivial work.\nIf Mr. Hillerman hasn't retired completely, I'll wait until his next book is available in the public domain before reading it.","summary":"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice ...","unixReviewTime":1055462400,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

My favorites are Dance Hall of the Dead and Skinwalkers.\nThe Sinister Pig, simply put, is an awful book, and is not even close to the level Hillerman has set for himself.  Much of the action takes place on airplanes and in limousines, and next to nothing occurs anywhere close to the Navajo reservation.  Hillerman tries to introduce the flavor of the New Mexico\/Mexico border region, but his descriptions do not even come close to the standard he set for the Four Corners area.  Had I not been to this area many times myself (I grew up in Arizona) I wouldn't be able to distinguish the border region from Kentucky.  Finally, the subtlety and grace of earlier Hillerman character interaction -- Leaphorn and Emma, Chee and Mary Landon, and so on -- has been blown away by a sudden urge by Hillerman to make everything explicit.  Yes, Tony, we know Chee loves Bernie and Bernie loves Chee -- why do you have to pound it in to us in every single scene?\nThis book was, simply put, painful to read, and I wouldn't have finished it at all were I not such a big Hillerman fan.  If you are new to Hillerman, please please please do not begin with this poor work.  And if you haven't read every Hillerman novel, probably multiple times, my advice is to put this one aside and go back to those books you haven't read, or haven't read in a while.  I really wonder, seriously, if Hillerman farmed this out to some ghost writer -- it really has the feel of some poor shmuck trying to mimic Hillerman's characters....... it's sad, because I had really hoped that Tony had one or two good novels still left in him, but if The Sinister Pig is any indication, he doesn't.

It was simplified to the point where all we read about was his yearning for her, and her for him. The level of which was dime store at best. Secondly, in trying to tie all the lead character's in, we find ourselves jumping from one simple story line connection to another. Chee to Leaphorn to Bernadette Manuelito, to an unknown power broker in Washington, etc. The resolution of the story lines would have better off in a typical weekly tv show.

Hillerman has masterfully evolved both of these characters over the past couple of decades, introducing Leaphorn, then Chee, and having them meet at respectful loggerheads and gradually develop a mutual admiration as their respective worlds evolve and change. Hillerman has done this so well that one would think he had everything planned out before he even set the first word to paper lo those many years ago, though that seems impossible. No matter. Hillerman remains unrivaled in his ability to capture the people and culture --- and the nuances of both --- of the American Southwest.\nTHE SINISTER PIG, Hillerman's latest novel, finds Leaphorn adjusting to retirement and life as a widower, while Jim Chee investigates the mysterious death of a stranger on the edge of the Jicarella Apache natural gas field. Though the Navajo Tribal Police have jurisdiction, the FBI quickly moves in and classifies the incident as a hunting accident. Chee, however, is not satisfied. The victim was not dressed for hunting and was stripped of identification. The proximity of his body to the natural gas field indicates that he might have been investigating charges that billions of dollars from the sale of gas have been embezzled from the Indian Tribal royalty trust. But if that was the case, for whom was he conducting the investigation?\nThe stakes become personal for Chee as he finds that photographs taken by Bernie Manuelito may have some bearing on the matter. Manuelito, a former member of Chee's squad and now with the Border Patrol, took the photos in the course of her investigation of suspicious activity around a ranch in southern New Mexico. She is unaware, however, that her photographs tie in with Chee's case and put her in terrible danger from an unexpected source. Chee must rely on his own knowledge, as well as Leaphorn's wise counsel and connections, if he is to resolve the mystery of the dead stranger and save Manuelito's life.\nTHE SINISTER PIG contains all of the elements that Hillerman is known for --- the interplay between Leaphorn and Chee, the strong characterization, and the intimate knowledge of Indian tribal culture and relationships. Chee is a particularly subtle delight here, as he struggles to come to grips with his feelings for Manuelito and his almost painful inability to articulate them.\nThe most significant aspect of THE SINISTER PIG, however, is the villain of the piece who gives this novel its name. A sinister pig is one who has more than he or she can use, but still wants more. The shadowy Rawley Winsor, in this case, is the sinister pig, and he is one of the more interesting adversaries you'll encounter in literature this year. And his assistant, the enigmatic Budge, practically makes the book all by himself. One almost gets the feeling that THE SINISTER PIG could easily have been twice the length of its 224 pages, that the story wants to burst out of its binding with more that could be told. Regardless, THE SINISTER PIG remains a worthy addition to Hillerman's canon.\n  --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub","summary":"A Worthy Addition to Hillerman's Canon","unixReviewTime":1054166400,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

And reading this newest Hillerman brings one quite up-to-date with each of the men, their current love life, and their efforts to solve a mystery of international intrigue.\nThis is not Hillerman's best novel, but one can forgive him because he does present a fast page turner and educates along the way.  Chee's romantic interest, Bernie Manuelito has gone to work for the Feds in the Border Patrol, and unlikely as it may seem, she becomes linked to a murder in the Four Corners.\nThe pig involved takes on several meanings, but would be especially familiar to anyone in the pipeline trade.  The double meaning, of course, indicates the greed that leads to corruption within governmental bodies.\nThis tale involves Washington, D. C. subterfuge, and enlists the Navajo Tribal Police,  U. S. Bureau of Land Management, U. S. Border Patrol,  the F. B. I., and the Office of Homeland Security.  Hillerman skillfully sets his tale in the midst of the real world worries of the 21st century.\nWill \"third time's charm\" work for Chee in his stumbling romance with Bernadette?  The romance and the mystery intertwine for a comfortable quick read and satisfying solution.\nCan't wait for the next Hillerman in order to meet up Leaphorn and Chee once more.  If you are a Hillerman fan, this is a must read.","summary":"Saving Bernie","unixReviewTime":1053302400,"vote":14.0,"image":null}
{"overall":4,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"05 18, 2003","reviewerID":"A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ","asin":"0002005263","style":{"Format:":" Hardcover"},"reviewerName":"Donald Mitchell","reviewText":"The Sinister Pig is one of Tony Hillerman's deftest plots and best designed stories.  Be careful not to read reviews that tell too much of the plot, or much of the book's pleasure will be needlessly spoiled for you.  Some will not like this story as much as previous ones because it moves into new ground, both geographically and story-telling-wise.  Having that reaction is like failing to appreciate the latest model of Ferrari while being totally fixated on the 1950s versions.  Be open to the evolution of Mr. Hillerman's skill and the potential of his characters.\nBecause this book relies so much on past character development to establish its story, it would be a major mistake to make this the first book you read in the series.  If you start with this book, the big mystery will be finding out who all of the people are and why the story involves them.  I think this is one of those series where you really should start at the beginning and work on from there.\nThis story is told from the perspective of several different characters, none of whom know everything that is going on.  As the reader, you are privy to more of their thoughts and knowledge than any of them have which helps you anticipate what will happen next.  Yet, until near the end, the ultimate meanings of the book's title will be hidden from you.  It's a nice job of misdirection and a gradual, tasty unpeeling of the story grape.\nNeither Jim Chee nor Joe Leaphorn are the center of this story, although they play major roles.  This is Bernie Manuelito's story although she doesn't appear in the book's opening.  She has left some of her frustrations with Jim Chee and the Navajo Tribal Police to join the U.S. Customs Border Patrol near the border of Arizona and New Mexico.  This takes her 200 miles from the reservation, and she's lonely despite making friends there.  She alternates pining for Jim and being annoyed by his seeming aloofness in letters.  He misses her desperately, but cannot bring himself to do anything about it.  Bernie finds her new job emotionally and physically challenging because it involves both stopping illegal immigrants who may be in trouble after being abandoned by the coyote guides who lead them and dangerous drug smugglers who will stop at nothing to get their valuable, illegal cargoes through.\nIn the background to the story are a mysterious investigation of misappropriation of billions in royalties due to Tribal Trust Funds from oil and gas sales, an unexplained death which the FBI hushes up, a Washington power broker who desperately wants the war on drugs to continue, former CIA agents and operatives, blackmail, a missing mistress, an exotic game ranch, an investigative reporter, and unexplained construction in the middle of nowhere.\nThe book's only flaw is that the villain is portrayed in terms that are a little too extreme to be credible.  He's more like a James Bond foe than a Tony Hillerman criminal.\nThe overall theme of this book is about how our misperceptions of what is going on are likely to lead us astray.  These misperceptions may be based on differences in language and culture, knowing only parts of the facts, having facts be withheld from us, or by assuming what others tell us is true when it is not.  Mr. Hillerman does a masterful job of portraying all of these problems, and showing that it is important that we act on our desire to know more . . . rather than being satisfied with what appears to be going on at the surface.  Better solutions are at hand, if only we grasp them.\nAfter you finish this fine book, I suggest that you think about where you may be misperceiving the potential around you.  How can you test the accuracy and completeness of those perceptions where it's important?\nDonald Mitchell\nCo-author of The 2,000 Percent Solution, The Irresistible Growth Enterprise and The Ultimate Competitive Advantage","summary":"Bernie Manuelito Tangles with a Corrupt Power Broker","unixReviewTime":1053216000,"vote":12.0,"image":null}

It hasn't been that long since THE WAILING WIND.\n This one is a very rapid read, with much of the action happening away from the Navajo reservation (Always a bad move, Tony). The plot centers around the murder of a retired CIA operative who's investigating the theft of billions of dollars in Indian oil, gas, coal, and timber royalties for a United States senator.\n Bernie Manuelito has taken a job with the border patrol to get away from Jim Chee, her pushy boss, when she stumbles across a suspicious construction project in the middle of the desert. Unknowingly, she has become embroiled in a smuggling operation and her picture is being spread around by Mexican drug traffickers as a DEA agent to be on the lookout for. Meanwhile, Chee is pining away for Bernie, trying to think of a reason to go get her and ask her to marry him. This is where Joe Leaphorn enters the picture. He gets out his maps and is able to tie the original murder scene to some abandoned oil and gas pipelines leading from Sonora, Mexico, to the site of the murder. The Sinister Pig of the title is a device used to clean the insides of the pipelines. Joe quickly grasps the possibilities.\n Hillerman uses multiple viewpoints to help us follow the action. There's a billionaire drug smuggler, his former CIA pilot (the most interesting character in the book), and a corrupt border patrol supervisor and of course our friends Joe, Jim, and Bernie.\n I'd be surprised if this book is over 70,000 words it reads so fast. I liked a couple of things about it, besides Chee and Leaphorn of course, two of the best characters in the mystery genre: the factual basis of the book, the royalty money which the Department of the Interior lost or stole and the great character, Budge C. de Baca, the billionaire's pilot, a romantic felon I haven't seen anywhere else. I also like Cowboy Dashee, a recurring character in the Leaphorn\/Chee series, who is now working for the Bureau of Land Management. He and Chee add comic relief to what might otherwise be a pretty conventional mystery.","summary":"Budge C. de Baca saves the day!","unixReviewTime":1052784000,"vote":20.0,"image":null}

We always loved it as a kid and now our little ones get to enjoy it as well. Highly recommend.","summary":"Highly recommend!!

The train breaks down and multiple trains pass by - they try to solicit help from each train but no train is willing to assist them. Finally comes a small train who, because of her size, doesn't think she is capable of pulling them over the mountain, but is moved by her compassion. While pulling the train, she tells herself over and over, \"I think I can, I think I can.\" And she does. :)\n\nA wonderful, sweet story with a good message and beautiful illustrations.

And only at the last \"bad\" engine do they introduce the gimmick of the book which everyone remembers -- where engines puff their thoughts in short little sentences. It would make a lot more sense if all the engines talked like the hero in short puffs.\n\nThe layout is also questionable. Long sentences break up between pages awkwardly and are hard to get out in a single breath.\n\nLastly, the hero's part and the Act III conclusion are way too short.

The story, of course, is about the Little Blue Engine, who has a positive attitude as compared with some of the less admirable traits of his fellow engines. Some of them are stuck up or snobby or full of negativity. The trains and even the cargo have personalities. (My sister and I liked the dolls.) And then one day, when faced with the possibility of some children over the mountain NOT GETTING THEIR CHRISTMAS GIFTS IN TIME (gasp!), the Little Blue Engine is the only one with enough motivation to drag those heavy cars up the steep tracks and save the day. I loved how \"I-think-I-can\" sounded so much like a train noise, and I could definitely imagine using it as a chant for little kids preparing for a difficult feat.","summary":"Great message, great art, great storytelling","unixReviewTime":1392076800,"vote":null,"image":null}

Blankenship","reviewText":"The Little Engine That Could is most certainly apart of that elite group of books which make up the cannon of childrens literature and rightfully so.  This story, and various versions of it, have been around a long, long time and the message it holds is as pertinent today as it was when this story was first conceived.\n\nWhile Watty Piper in most generally given credit for the writing of this wonderful little book, the story was actually first conceived in 1906 under the title Thinking One Can, and was meant to be a Sunday School Story.  It was later published under the title of The Pony Engine, in 1920.  After morphing through several versions and several titles, it was finally published in 1930 by Watty piper which was a pseudonym for the publisher.  Since that time this little and wonderful story had continued to change in detail and even films have been made.  The message throughout the years though has remained the same.\n\nNow this newest version, the one being reviewed here is indeed different than the original and the story has been snipped and changed here and there and the art work is most certainly different.  Now I am a traditionalist when it comes to such works and normally I would go into a rant at this point in my review.  Not so in this case.  I picked this one up at the library and despite the changes; I found it to be a very well done little book.  Just because I could identify with and enjoyed the original so very much when I was a wee one, does not mean that the current generation will not be able to do the same with this one.\n\nDon Blankenship\nThe Ozarks","summary":"An old story with some changes","unixReviewTime":1387670400,"vote":null,"image":null}

This hardcover is HUGE (just over 12 inches by just under 10 inches), and Long's textured acrylic artwork, often in two-page spreads, is the focal point here.\n\nThe message--Think Positively--is as vital for children now as it was when Platt & Munk published it in 1930.

Goonan","reviewText":"I loved this book as a child and I still remember my mother reading it to me vividly to this day.  She has since passed away, however, the underlying message of the book about having confidence in oneself stuck.  I think this theme of \"knowing you can do it\" is a value message for children to learn.\n\nI read through the story of the book and it had even more impact with the updated art.  The images are original, powerful and really bring the story to life.  I can see why they would appeal to children and the use of colors is amazing.\n\nI've read a few reviewers comments that the book is sexist.  I didn't notice that the \"bad trains\" were a certain gender and the \"good trains\" another when I read it.  However, I'm wondering if this just may be a coincidence.  I have a hard time believing the author of a classic like this with such a good underlying positive message would do something like this on purpose.  Ditto... for the editors who are watching out for problems like this.  While I could be wrong, I think Watty Piper deserves the benefit of the doubt and perhaps she will be open to making some editorial changes to correct an apparent sexist slant in future editions.\n\nI also found the large format and prints in this book a value add.  It is also printed on nice paper and lends itself to being used over and over.  This format also makes it good for reading to small groups where the children will need to see the pictures from a distance.\n\nThe toys seemed to be almost alive to me.  The artwork was succesful in giving them some kind of personality.  They seem more than just stuffed animals and I think this quality will appeal and endear them to children.\n\nThe art is so captivating that it almost distracts me from the story.  I have to admit I haven't read the classic version in a long time, but it seems to me there was more repetition of the core message in that version.  If my memory is faulty, I think it would be an improvement to repeat the \"I think I can.... I know I can....\" theme more often.\n\nOverall, I don't think you can go wrong purchasing this classic book.  It's a great read and a visual delight.","summary":"This was one of my childhood favorites, but it now features much more vibrant art!","unixReviewTime":1160179200,"vote":17.0,"image":null}

For this reason alone, it is unfair to compare it to the previous editions. The older editions are illustrated with small, simple, colored line drawings rather than lavish, full-page, full-color paintings.\n\nLong's illustrations are beautiful and, in my opinion, suit the story better than the old ones did. As I child, I was never quite sure if the clown and dolls were toys or people. Long's illustration makes them obviously toys.\n\nLong's illustrations give the different locomotives distinct looks and personalities. The original illustrations for both previous editions of the book have locomotives that are virtually identical, except for being different colors. The passenger engine in Long's illustration is a sleek, streamlined design with an arrogant, sneering expression, while the freight engine is a massive, dark iron, whale-like machine that looms over and peers down at the tiny clown.\n\nIt's unfortunate that the review from the School Library Journal was chosen by Amazon for the Editorial Reviews, above. I'd like to correct some errors - the writer has her facts wrong about the history of this book.\n\nWhat Burg believes to be the original edition of the book is, in fact, the 1954 edition with illustrations by George and Doris Hauman. Although Burg praises the '1930s' look of these illustrations with the green poka-dotted clown, they scream '1950s!'. While most people today are familiar with this version, I think the older illustrations are showing their age, and I believe children today will relate better to Long's paintings. Also, as I have stated above, I believe Long's illustrations help tell the story better.\n\nThe actual 1930s illustrations were colored line drawings by Lois Lenski, and few people today will have seen them. Interestingly, those illustrations show the story taking place in a stark, snow-covered winter landscape.\n\nBurg claims Loren Long's paintings have a '1950s' look. Anyone familiar with painting styles of the 1930s will recognize the influence of painters like Grant Wood on Long's style. Long's illustrations are much truer to the 1930s than the 1954 illustrations are.\n\nI am a friend of Loren Long's, and I know how hard he worked on these illustrations and how much this book meant to him. These paintings were a labor of love.","summary":"rebutting the Editorial Reviews for this book","unixReviewTime":1128384000,"vote":105.0,"image":null}

The story shows how small people (or trains, if you want to be literal) with a good heart (like a child) can make a big difference in the world.

This version does retain much of the essence, however, and is great for the pre-school set. The only \"negative\" I can think of is that the kids so love the repetition that parents may grow a bit tired of the daily requests for it to be re-read, especially if the particular child wants to hear only certain sections (I knew one who always wanted \"the clown part,\" the other \"the food part.\")\nThe same enjoyable repetition makes this a favourite story to read to children in primary grades.

Creech","reviewText":"Like many others, I first read these poems as a very young child.  I didn't realise until rereading them just recently how many of them had stayed with me.  The poems all deal with sounds, sights and emotions that  will be familiar to most young children.  And as an adult, the poetry of  Robert Louis Stevenson brings back that sense of wonder and amazement that  many of us lose as we grow older.  One of the poems that I will always  remember deals with how difficult it is to go to bed when you are told in  the summer when the days are long and the sun is still out.  who doesn't  remember this?\nThe illustrations in this particular edition, by Tasha  Tudor, capture perfectly the childhood world of the poetry--the imagination  in play is wonderfully portrayed.  Remember when the space under the table  became a cave, or a castle, or a spaceship?  These poems and the  accompanying illustrations deal with these imaginary adventures that all  children share in.\nPurchase this book and share it with other adults  and with the children in your life.  If it stays with you for the rest of  your life, then you have gained a treasure.","summary":"wonderful poems that will stay with you","unixReviewTime":961113600,"vote":60.0,"image":null}

We miss that visual poetry. The illustrations are the only visual element and they are nice but not enough to make us enter in this world of childrens poetry, of poetry for children that has to be visually clear and attractive.\n\nThe second characteristic is that it is poetry written for children. Yet it is mostly in first person as if some hypothetical child were speaking and that is not possible because the language is by far too complicated for a child that has just learned how to read. It is thus poetry that has to be read to children and what children are going to find in the poetry is the music with lines, rhymes and rhythm. It is of course a common convention for childrens literature in the second half of the 19th century, which is Stevensons period. Childrens literature is adult literature for children.\n\nThe themes are essentially that of a garden, a vast garden and a vast house, if not mansion in the countryside by the sea. We are in a wealthy family or even more than wealthy, with a nurse for that child who is a boy and cannot be anything else, knowing how often he plays with tin soldiers or he plays soldier himself, even if at the end an allusion to a cousin girl is introduced. The world is seen through the eyes of the boy and described through the pen and language of the adult who is telling us the story. The big Louis author is alluding towards the end he is seeing the world through the eyes of a small Louis boy that he probably used to be.\n\nThen you have a lot of seascape, ships, boats, fishing, travelling and foreign countries, though the dominant one is India but only as a distant somewhere. The child is also imagining fairy countries, dreamlike countries to which he is able to travel. But do not expect any Wonderland.\n\nThe most surprising element is the total solitude of that child. He is alone, playing alone and by himself with toys he can play with alone. He does not have any partner and adults are not taking part in the games. The nurse only puts him to bed and gets him up. In many ways it is a sad vision of a solitary quasi abandoned child in a wealthy family where everyone is minding their own businesses and hardly the child. So he sleeps at night, watches the sun rising in the morning, plays in the garden all day long, watches the sun setting in the evening and goes back to bed at night. That kind of life is traumatic. A child living such a life should develop PTSS by total lack of love, total lack of company, total lack of another child of the same size, except the imaginary one he creates, and that should lead him to a split personality, a perfect soil for schizophrenia later on.\n\nI was even amazed at finding some social Darwinism in one poem:\n\nThe child that is not clean and neat,\nWith lots of toys and things to eat,\nHe is a naughty child, Im sure \nOr else his dear papa is poor.\n\nIn other words, it is the fate of a naughty rich boy or a poor boy. And it is normal if you are poor not to be clean and neat, not to have toys and food. There is no questioning of it and it is equaled to naughtiness for a rich boy. A good boy, meaning rich, is always clean and neat, has plenty of toys and plenty to eat. Just add to this it is the reward for being a good rich boy and social Darwinism is with you. This concepts of good boy and bad boy are constantly present in many poems and one is for me surprisingly European-centered to the point of reaching infantile arrogance:\n\nFOREIGN CHILDREN\n\nLittle Indian, Sioux or Crow,\nLittle frosty Eskimo,\nLittle Turk or Japanee,\nOh! Dont you wish that you were me?\n\nYou have seen the scarlet trees\nAnd the lions overseas;\nYou have eaten ostrich eggs,\nAnd turned the turtles off their legs.\n\nSuch a life is very fine,\nBut its not so nice as mine:\nYou must often, as you trod,\nHave wearied not to be abroad.\n\nYou have curious things to eat,\nI am fed on proper meat;\nYou must dwell beyond the foam,\nBut I am safe and live at home.\n\nLittle Indian, Sioux or Crow,\nLittle frosty Eskimo,\nLittle Turk or Japanee,\nOh! Dont you wish that you were me?\n\nHow plain cruel it is to turn turtles off their legs knowing they cannot get back on their legs alone. Just as cruel as making the Indian, the Sioux, the Crow, the Eskimo, the Turk and the Japanese only dream of one thing: be a good white European, rich of course.\n\nDr. Jacques COULARDEAU","summary":"Slightly pass","unixReviewTime":1493596800,"vote":null,"image":null}

Next to Tasha Tudor's illustrations for the poems she selected for her collection, Wings From The Wind, I like these lovely (on a smaller scale) drawings by Eve Garnett.  Garnett was the first British writer of children's stories to write wonderful stories of working class families (in London) (The Family from One End Street, etc.), and she illustrated her own books.  A small gem of a story of hers (\"The Kind Visitor\") can be found in a collection of stories titled: A Golden Land, edited by James Reeves.  The story originally appeared in Eve Garnett's collection of four of her stories, called:  Lost And Found.

Not only are they terrible poetry, they have outdated and toxic ideas (such as the idea of \"bad children\" and the verse about \"foreign children\"), and much.of the vocab is so outdated that it won't be understood by today's kids without so much explanation that any magic will be stripped away. Also, FYI they are skewed toward gun\/soldier play. There are a lot of important childhood experiences in the verses that are great to discuss with children such as imagination and what to do when you're lonely but I cannot in good conscience recommend this book. I was so excited to find the 1960 illustrated version but now this may be the second book ever that I'll put in the recycling bin.

I read them to my kids when they were babies through school age; there is enough going on in the poems and the pictures are good enough they liked them.  I also got a CD of them put to music, sung by a lovely soprano. (Music for Little People\/ Ted Jacobs) and we listened all the time when the kids were little, including as bedtime lullabies. My middle schooler has just stopped letting me sing \"Young Night Thought\" to him then, and I still sing \"The Moon\" or \"Lamplighter to my 10 year old.

I am commenting specifically on Tasha Tudor's lovely illustrations of childhood life, so beautifully paired with Robert Louis Stevenson's poetry of childhood.  Together, image and word are a perfect match, and this is a marvelous edition.  I highly recommend it as a gift for any new parent, a special child, or for yourself.\n\nI live with my grandfather, who was born in 1922 and grew up having these poems read to him and then reading them for himself; when he grew up and had children of his own, he read from this book.  They were a little bit \"old-fashioned\" when my grandfather was a boy in the 1920s, but not at all \"dated\" in the way some of them have become.  I am thinking here of \"Foreign Children,\" with its refrain:\n\nLittle Indian, Sioux or Crow,\nLittle frosty Eskimo,\nLittle Turk or Japanee,\nO! don't you wish that you were me?\n\nThere are others in a similar vein, and while I am sure that some will object, I find all of these poems to be utterly lacking in malice or cruelty.  They espouse the ideology of their time, and that was one of Empire.  If you don't want to read the few of these poems that mention race\/ethnicity in a way that you don't like, then don't -- or better yet, how about using it as a teachable moment to discuss the ways in which views evolve over time?\n\nThe majority of these poems feel timeless, in that they dwell in the land of childhood imagination.  Just reading \"The Land of Counterpane\" sends me right back to the world of childhood and the hours and hours spent dreaming, creating, imagining.  Likewise, \"The Land of Nod.\"  I know my grandfather feels just the same way, because sometimes when I tuck him in for bed at night we discuss where we plan to travel in our dreams: the Land of Counterpane or the Land of Nod.  Very few things are capable of staying with a person for 80 + years; these poems are some of them.\n\nIf you have children, or know any children you particularly like, I hope you will purchase a copy of this lovely book for them.  It's one of those books that opens a door into another world, and what the child chooses to do once there is up to him or her -- but you can give the key to the door.","summary":"Tasha Tudor edition is beautiful","unixReviewTime":1374278400,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

Poetry is not my favorite form of literature.  However, Stevenson is one of my best-loved authors, and I have always liked his poetry because, unlike some other poetry that I have read, it makes sense to me.  One of my favorites is \"The Swing\":\nHow do you like to go up in a swing,\nUp in the air so blue?\nOh, I do think it the pleasantest thing\nEver a child can do!\n  Of course, one would buy this edition of A Child's Garden of Verses not only for Stevenson's poetry (this is not a complete version but a newly revised selection) but also for Brian Wildsmith's gorgeous, whimsical illustrations.  Wildsmith, born in 1931 at the mining village of Penistone in Yorkshire, England, has been called one of the greatest living children's book illustrators.  Stevenson's poems perfectly capture the make-believe imagination of childhood.  What child has not pretended at one time or another that his bed is a ship sailing the wide seas?  And Wildsmith's stunning, colorful paintings perfectly capture the joyful childhood innocence of Stevenson's poetry.  While the language may be upper class Victorian England, the appeal is universal.  This would make a wonderful book for a parent to read aloud while the child gazes at the pictures.","summary":"perfectly captures joyful childhood innocence","unixReviewTime":1338336000,"vote":null,"image":null}

There are only 8 poems, which suprisingly captivate my 2-year-old, despite her short attention span. I look forward to sharing the complete book with her when she's older.","summary":"Perfect toddler version of a classic","unixReviewTime":1192233600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Vodrey","reviewText":"Most everyone knows that Robert Louis Stevenson was sickly, both as a child and as an adult, and the happy result for the reading public was his nearly feverish flights of imagination.  Here, in an edition of his classic \"A Child's Garden of Verses,\" that fever is complemented in spades by the fantastical illustrations of English artist Joanna Isles.\nIsles uses an arsenal of utterly frivolous flowers, borders, insects, birds, kings and queens, fairies, and more to expand upon the imagination exhibited in Stevenson's poems.  The children in these pictures are depicted as being in charge, being at one with their environment, and being delighted to be alive.\nSome of the illustrations hint at the influence of artists more famed than Isles (Henri Rousseau appears to be a special favorite of hers--see the illustration for \"The Unseen Playmate,\" in which a boy lies down in weeds that might have sprung from the edge of Rousseau's painting \"The Dream\").  Using both primary colors and pastels, Isles creates a world within the world of Stevenson's verse.  The marriage of the two is a happy one.","summary":"A beautiful melding of words and pictures","unixReviewTime":1026172800,"vote":17.0,"image":null}

Vodrey","reviewText":"This classic edition of Robert Louis Stevenson's \"A Child's Garden of Verses\" is justly famed because it so beautifully pairs Stevenson's sometimes exuberant, sometimes melancholy poems on childhood with the extraordinary illustrations of Tasha Tudor.\nTudor's delicate watercolors complement Stevenson's work almost to the point that you think the two, living in different centuries, must share some time-travel telepathy with each other.  All the classic Stevenson pieces are here: \"The Swing,\" \"The Land of Counterpane,\" the terrific poem about a child's shadow.  Tudor depicts only children and animals herein--as it should be--without the presence of shadow of adults anywhere.  Both Stevenson and Tudor understand in their bones that no matter what grown-ups may think, children inhabit a world of their own.  That world is mostly beautiful, but sometimes fraught with danger or questions.  Those hints are present here, but the overwhelming impression any reader will have will be that of beauty--both in words and in pictures.","summary":"A classic for any child (or child at heart)","unixReviewTime":1026172800,"vote":97.0,"image":null}

For example, Maurice Sendak, when asked to list books that he thought every child should have the opportunity to read, named this collection first. Harold Bloom, renowned literary critic (he has received more major awards from his peers than any other) and author of the thought-provoking and controversial \"The Western Canon\", included ACGoV in the list he furnished in response to an interviewer's request for a \"Western Canon, Jr\". Among the homeschooling set, everyone from \"Unschoolers\" to \"Classical Christian Educators\" recommend it.(It\"s on the Classical Christian Support Loop's \"1000 Good Books List\").\nThe Chronical Books edition, containing all 64 of the poems that appeared in the original 1885 edition, is lavishly illustrated with more than a hundred pictures, many of them full page, by several of the most distinguished children's book illustrators of the late 19th and early 20th century. The book is well laid out, with a pleasing juxtaposition of art and text, and printed on high-quality paper. It was named one of the \"Top Ten Picturebooks of the Year\" by Redbook, was an American Bookseller \"Pick of the Lists\" in 1989, and was given a starred review in Booklist.\nStevenson perfectly captures the child's world of sunshine, stars, dreams, toy boats, swings, apple tarts, fairies, flowers, and far-away places in simple, evocative language which remains just as accessable for today's children as it was for their grandparents. And I can think of only one poem that might offend modern \"Politically Correct\" sensibilities: \"Foreign Children\", wherein the speaker imagines asking various nationalities' children \"O! don't you wish that you were me!\" I guess the historical and socio-cultural context of this poem could be discussed with your child if you were so inclined.\nIn short, this venerated work, and especially this glorious Chronical Books edition of it, belongs in every child's library. No other volume of children's poetry has been so well loved by so many generations. ...","summary":"Heirloom Edition of a Venerable Classic.","unixReviewTime":987638400,"vote":37.0,"image":null}

Writing them is a true art and Robert Louis Stevenson is able to perfect this art by remembering his own childhood. These poems were written between 1881 and 1884.\n\nThis is a selection from the most popular collection of poems about childhood in the English language. Each poem is accompanied by evocative paintings, which are as vibrant as the words in each poem.\n\nThe paintings are impressions of color and light and show children and a few animals on beautiful canvases of cities, gardens, meadows and seas. The poems are about flying kites, cows which give cream to enjoy with apple-tart, flowers where fairies live, children sitting in the warm sun, children on a swing, children playing with toy boats and children playing in gardens who will never grow up as they are frozen in time in the beautiful pictures. Here is an example of part of the first poem in the book.\n\nTHE WIND\n\nI saw you toss the kites on high\nAnd blow the birds about the sky;\nAnd all around I heard you pass,\nLike ladies skirts across the grass-\n\nWhat lovely poems to share with a child.

I really don't care if it is authentic as I simply wanted a clean copy to share with my son, as my inherited copy is falling to pieces.  The original I own does not have the Learn to Read logo in the top right corner of the cover or on the back, and I trust the ones that do are all 2nd prints.  It is too bad so many people are asking $70+ for this less than original version, though I have no idea why anyone would pay $70+ for a musty book.  As for the content, it is an every night read with my son.  He loves it and asks me the names of each different type of house, testing my knowledge.  I strongly encourage anyone to hunt a newer copy of this down.  I am intrigued if this book was the inception of my love of travel and see the world, but wouldn't be surprised if it was.

Now, Dr. Seuss has a few rather odd books mixed in with a large company of hits.

But unlike some of his other odd books, this one does not 'feel' like Dr. Seuss.

Sherwin","reviewText":"I Am Not Going To Get Up Today (Beginner Books) by Dr. Seuss is a whimsical fantasy tale that should appeal to very young children. As another reviewer notes, young kids are full of energy; they don't truly want to stay in bed and this book won't encourage them to do that, either. However, the story makes a great fantasy and the book is also a solid educational tool for children learning to read.\n\nThe story is relatively simple; a young boy is tired and he wants to take the day off and lounge in bed. He is rather obstinate; even his mother and a cop can't get him out of bed! Along the way, the young child learns a lot about the English language and reading--and that's great.\n\nChildren are introduced to names of places including Paris, Massachusetts, Berlin, Alaska, China, Spain and more! This can easily generate a conversation with your child about what foreign (or distant) places are like; and the child can get a good basic understanding that the world is really a very large place with many different cultures.\n\nThis book also teaches children the sounds that some things make. For example, the book, usually through the use of text that rhymes, mentions how birds \"peep;\" how an alarm clock \"rings;\" how a bed can be \"warm\" and how a pillow can be \"deep.\" Great!\n\nI suppose that for some very active children the idea of a child taking a rest in bed could show them an example of the importance of learning to rest.\n\nOverall, I Am Not Going To Get Up Today is another fine children's book by the great Dr. Seuss; and I recommend this book heartily for parents to read with their very young children. The book is an excellent educational tool that helps children learn to read and understand words, places and other concepts like \"warm\" and \"deep.\"\n\nGreat job, Dr. Seuss!","summary":"fine children's book that helps them learn so much...","unixReviewTime":1205539200,"vote":14.0,"image":null}

The book begins with this refrain by a small boy with a dog lying under his bed.\n\"Please let me be,\nPlease go away,\nI am not going to get up today!\"\nIn the course of the story, the boy resists the alarm, peeping birds, other kids getting up, his mother bringing in an egg for breakfast, noise of siblings, tickling his feet, shaking his bed, pouring cold water on his head, talking by the neighbors, noise by neighbors, sweets, dogs, roosters, goats, geese, the police, publicity in the newspaper, the Marines, and a television crew.\nHe still wants to \"lie here woozy-snoozing.\"\nIn the end, his mother brings in a policeman and says:\n\"I guess he really means it.\nSo you can have the egg.\"\nHave you ever been that tired?

Judging by this book I'm thinking he should stick to chemistry.\n\nI'm not saying that Schwarcz's dietary recommendations are bad. After you take away the discussions of chemical terms and processes you end up with the same sort of recommendations you've been hearing about for decades: Eat mostly foods based on vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and low-fat dairy, and don't overeat. Hey, is there ANY nutrition book out there that recommends eating mostly meat, fat, and sugar, and overeating?\n\nI majored in biology at college, so I thought that a chemistry-focused discussion of nutrition would be interesting. I was wrong. I can't really fault Schwarcz for that, because his book makes it clear that it will get into some chemistry, and many of the chemicals in foods have long, hard to pronounce names. But the subtitle to the book led me to believe that the chemistry discussion would be enlivened by learning about \"the myths, misconceptions, and truths about the foods we eat.\" Again I was wrong, and this time I can fault Schwarcz. Schwarcz ends up recommending the same type of whole-food, unprocessed diet as any mainstream diet book, so I wonder just which myths and misconceptions he thinks he is addressing? He recommends that meat should be \"an occasional treat,\" and even then the portion size \"should cover a small portion of the plate.\" Those people who still believe in the \"myth\" that humans need to eat lots of meat would sooner barbecue Schwarcz's book than read it. Regarding other myths and misconceptions, Schwarcz is covering old, well-trod ground. I suppose this book might be helpful to someone who has had his head in the nutritional sands for the past two decades.\n\nI can't forgive the chapter on milk. His discussion of calcium and osteoporosis is superficial at best. He doesn't address any of the major risk factors for osteoporosis, nor does he discuss the chemical processes underlying them, nor effective countermeasures. He doesn't offer a single study demonstrating that consuming dairy lowers the incidence of bone fractures, which seems strange considering that this is the dairy industry's number one claim to fame. Schwarcz does point to two studies which contradict his claim that milk is good for bones, but he blatantly dismisses them. One study shows that \"Asians have a lower incidence of osteoporosis than Westerners even though they consume less dairy.\" Schwarcz responds by saying, \"True enough, but they also have a very different overall diet and lifestyle.\" He leaves it at that, and he doesn't bother to say what parts of the \"very different diet and lifestyle\" are healthier! He then mentions the comprehensive Nurses' Health Study \"which found that nurses who drank two or more glasses of milk a day actually broke more bones and had a higher risk of hip fractures.\" Schwarcz responds by subscribing to a hypothesis that the nurses who drank more milk were the ones who had the weakest bones to begin with! I say hypothesis because he has no evidence for it. To make things worse, Schwarcz goes out of his way to describe anyone who \"criticizes\" milk consumption as part of the \"antimilk lobby,\" driven more by an irrational agenda than any objective analysis of the evidence. I eat moderate amounts of dairy (for taste, not health), and I'm not part of any antimilk lobby, but does that mean I must believe that dairy foods are good for my bones? Schwarcz says that when we \"look at the totality of the evidence, an overwhelming number of studies show that bone strength improves with calcium intake, and dairy products offer the best source of calcium.\" Schwarcz is linking dairy to calcium to bone strength, which in effect means he is suggesting that dairy is good for bones. But again, he doesn't offer even one study which gives any evidence for this claim, and instead shows us two studies which contradict it. Furthermore, Schwarcz dismisses \"antimilk\" arguments that no other species except humans drink milk after weaning. He's missing the entire point: the objective and telling observation that all adult animals on earth thrive without milk. Schwarcz would have us believe as scientific gospel that human adults, for special reasons he never explains, need milk to thrive and prevent bone fractures (except, of course, for those Asian human adults, who have very different diets and lifestyles!).\n\nThis is the model of clear, rational, scientific thinking we're supposed to follow, as Publishers Weekly says, that \"leaves readers with a rational framework for evaluating the complex nature of foods and how they affect health.\"? I'd say it's a great example of a cloudy, irrational, and incomplete framework. In the end, the best that Schwarcz can do is tell us that milk \"is not a poison,\" as some fringe members of PETA might say.\n\nIn conclusion, Schwarcz did not bust any new myths or misconceptions and his recommendations are consistent with mainstream recommendations. You know the drill: Eat mostly veggies, fruits, beans, and whole grains, don't overeat, engage in enjoyable physical activities, get adequate rest. If you do all that don't worry about whatever else you like to eat!","summary":"A chemistry experiment gone bad!","unixReviewTime":1238976000,"vote":13.0,"image":null}

No other species designs airplanes, develops antibiotics, or bakes bread either.\"\n\nHe tries to refute the Nurse's Health Study by suggesting that the nurses who were drinking the most milk, were doing so not because they liked it, but because they knew they had a genetic predisposition and\/or other risk factors for osteoporosis, and believed consuming more cow's milk would help them. So, to his way of thinking, drinking more milk was largely a reflection of an overall greater osteoporotic risk in general. Therefore, milk should not be singled out and blamed for the increased incidence of hip-fracture seen in the Nurse's Health Study. As the extra milk was possibly beneficial, but just not beneficial enough, to overcome the higher  risks within this \"self-selected subgroup\". While the lead author of this study may lend some support for that hypothesis, her coauthor, Dr. Walter Willett, does not.\n\nIn this short chapter the author refers to the heavy environmental contamination of dairy as a \"trace of dioxin\". He acknowledges that dairy fat is a problem, but suggests we eat low-fat dairy, and limit saturated fats from elsewhere.\n\nHe doesn't get into the tumor-promoting properties of casein, the primary milk protein. Likewise, he stays right away from the whole raw milk issue, or movement, and the destruction of nutrients through pasteurization. There's no discussion on grass-fed, as opposed to grain-fed cows, or any issues relating to factory farming. Although he does give brief mention to insulin-like growth factor.\n\nMost people who know anything about nutrition, know that 2% cow's milk actually contains over 30% of calories from fat. The dairy industry likes to mislead and deceive the public by measuring \"water\" weight, rather than counting calories.\n\nThis author pulls a similar stunt with calcium. He boasts, \"A glass of milk contains about 300 milligrams of calcium, a cup of yogurt 400. By comparison, the best vegetable source is broccoli, with about 100 milligrams per cup.\"\n\nOf course, he's not only wrong about broccoli being the best vegetable source of calcium, ( bok choy and kale are both significantly higher ) but he doesn't bother to mention that a cup of broccoli contains only about a third the calories of a cup of milk, and, like other cruciferous vegetables, broccoli has a far superior nutrient-profile. He does recommend broccoli in a different part of the book.\n\nThere is some comic relief with the author's explanation for why large segments of the world's population are lactose intolerant. Apparently, the human species evolved hand in hoof with the dairy cow. But centuries ago, the tsetse fly spread sleeping sickness throughout much of Africa and Asia, decimating cattle populations. So, not having access to cow's milk, human populations, over time, lost much of their \"natural\" ability to make lactase, the enzyme responsible for lactose digestion.\n\nWhile some primitive populations did thrive on diets containing some cow's milk, it's important to make the distinction that what they consumed is a far cry from what is available to us at the grocery store. Derived largely from grain-fed cows, pumped up on growth hormone to increase milk production and antibiotics to ward off the sickness inherent to the animal's living conditions ( at least in most of the U.S. ), much of the already compromised nutrition in the milk, is destroyed through pasteurization. And dairy fat today, contains more dioxin, and more environmental contaminates in general, than any other food North Americans are likely to ingest.\n\nThe author claims that while \"milk may not be a miracle food, it can contribute significantly to a healthy diet. It assuredly is not poison, as suggested by the likes of PETA\".\n\nWebster's Dictionary defines poison as, \"a substance that through it's chemical action can injure or kill\".\n\nIt's debatable whether cow's milk, as it's generally produced today, is actually poison, but it most assuredly is ( as even the Weston A. Price Foundation will acknowledge ), crap!\n\nWhile \"milk and calcium\" is admittedly a very very small portion of this book, in my eyes, the author has seriously undermined his credibility. Do I now trust or care what he says about fluoride added to tap water? No!\n\nWho do I trust?\n\nIf you want to know what the medical literature says about diet and health, read Joel Fuhrman's updated revision of\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Eat-to-Live-The-Revolutionary-Formula-for-Fast-and-Sustained-Weight-Loss\/dp\/0316735507\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Eat to Live: The Revolutionary Formula for Fast and Sustained Weight Loss<\/a>","summary":"We Design Airplanes, Therefore We Should Drink Cow's Milk?","unixReviewTime":1228867200,"vote":9.0,"image":null}

It can be enjoyed by people of any age, of course.]\n\nAt our house the stories were met with almost universal praise from both the 6 and 8 year old.  And what's nice about Seuss books, besides the rampant craziness, is the fact that children often forget how many words they are reading as they work away at finding out what happens.\n\nSummary :::  A fun Seuss reader which contains three stories.  The AR designation is 2.9 but the word-magic of story and rhyme makes this book appropriate for non-reading children as well.\n\nPam T~","summary":"A Great Primer for More Advanced Readers - a review of \"I Can Lick 30 Tigers Today!\"","unixReviewTime":1204243200,"vote":17.0,"image":null}

Each story makes a simple point.  The title story is about a young fellow who looks like a smaller version of the Cat in the Hat (there is reason to believe he is part of the next generation) who declares that he can lick thirty tigers today.  However, as soon as he see the thirty tigers he starts finding reasons to whittle down that number, which should indicate to young readers the problems of biting off more than you can chew (pick whatever phrase that expresses this idea you like even if it is your eyes are bigger than your stomach).\n\"King Looie Katz\" is about the fancy cat named Looie who was the King of Katzen-stein and who was so proud of his royal tail that not only did he wash it every morning in a ten-gallon golden pail.  In fact, King Looie is so proud that he decides that his tail should never be allowed to touch the earth and he made Fooie Katz follow him around and keep from dragging on the ground.  When Fooie notices his tail is sagging he makes Kooie Katz lift up his tail.  Soon all the cats in Katzen-stein are walking round and round keeping each other's tails from dragging on the ground.  All the cats, that is, except one in this simple story about being more \"demo-catic.\"\nFinally there is \"The Glunk that Got Thunk,\" which has the distinction of being the wordiest Dr. Seuss story I have ever read.  The sister of the small cat we met in the first story likes to go upstairs after supper and use her Thinker-Upper.  Usually she thinks up friendly little things with smiles and fuzzy fur.  But one night she decides to go for go for something more fun and discovers she has thunked a Glunk.  There are two problems with this.  First, a Glunk cannot be UN-thunk.  Second, this Glunk calls his mother each night, which is an expensive long distance phone call (ten dollars a minute), and this particular Glunk will never stop talking (which explains why this story gets so wordy; beginning readers will be amazed).  There are actually several lessons that can be drawn from this one.\nNone of these are what I would call first level Dr. Seuss books but there are three of them, which just about adds up to a solid collection.  You readers might find it strange to find three short stories collected in one, but there are other such collections out there.  These stories are a bit more inclined towards making points beyond the good doctor's normal delightful infatuation with the realm of imagination.","summary":"Dr. Seuss makes a series of lessons in a trio of stories","unixReviewTime":1085875200,"vote":10.0,"image":null}

I had never actually read these stories growing up, so I got this book on a whim since I love so many of the others.\n\nThe first story, \"I can lick 30 Tigers Today\", talks about \"licking\" but in reference to \"beating up\" which is not how most people use the word \"licking\" anymore. The lesson is certainly still applicable: be careful not to over promise what you are capable of, or to not bite off more than you can chew. However, parents might need to explain the alternate meaning (not that small children aren't already putting everything in their mouth as it is...).\n\nSimilarly, the third story centers around a Glunk who makes a very lengthy long distance call (on a LANDLINE!!) which costs a lot of money. These days, with unlimited talk plans we'll have to explain why this was such a big deal! Maybe we should reprint a version where the Glunk goes over the family data plan. (kidding!)\n\nIn my opinion, the best story was the middle one because of the \"demo-catic\" lesson of not just following along with the crowd and for standing up and saying something when everyone else is being silly. Even if you are the littlest cat in Katzenstein you have the power to influence many!\n\nGreat addition to your Suess collection and easy to read all at once or broken up into three installments.","summary":"New Suess for me!","unixReviewTime":1441152000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Then he says, \"I'll beat you up right after lunch.\"\n\nKing Looie Katz is about a king cat who loves his tail so much that he puts someone in charge of holding up his tail all day long.  Then that person wants the same service and so on until one big line is formed.  But the last cat in line feels cheated and quits the job which inspires everyone else to become more \"demo-catic.\"\n\nThe Glunk that Got Thunk is about a little girl who dreams up soft fuzzy little things every day after dinner.

But that dream become much too much for her and her brother must come along and save her.\n\nI was disappointed in the quality of the verse in stories 2 and 3 and the messages in  stories 1 and 3.

The title caught my eye, and the cover showed the silhouette of a castle and a quote from Ursula Le Guin: \"A bitter, complex, brilliant book.\"\n\nWell, I thought, I'm bitter, complex, and brilliant, so this just might be for me.  So I plunked down my eighty-five cents and took it home, never knowing it was a cult novel that would challenge me like few others.\n\nThere's three interwoven stories, each in the same location. The first and central story is a romance between two teenagers in 1973 England, with one going off to college. The kids are wistful, honest, confused, very intelligent, and trying to hold onto the one thing they know is sure in the world.\n\nThey stood in the shelter of the tower, holding each other, rocking with gentleness.\n\"I love you,\" said Jan.\n\"I'm coming to terms with it.\"\n\" - love you.\"\n\"But there's a gap.\"\n\"Where?\"\n\"I know things, and feeling things, but the wrong way round. That's me: all the right answers at none of the right times. I see and can't understand. I need to adjust my spectrum, pull myself away from the blue end. I could do with a red shift.\"\n\nThe second story focuses on a small band of the lost Roman Ninth Legion trying to blend in with the first century tribes of Britain. Religion, subversion, and revelation rise among the brutality of war. One of them, Macey, is prone to berserker-like fits. Anyone who likes military fiction, or gritty fantasy, will appreciate the realistic depictions of their battles, all laced in Vietnam-like delirium.\n\n\"You and Magoo stand sentry,\" said Logan, \"but listen. All of you get this, and get it good. The guards have been taken out, maybe not by Cats. The Mothers have come south. They'll raid the Cats wherever they find them, and both sides will whip our ass if we let them. Solutions.\"\n\"The usual,\" said Face. \"Divide and rule. Hit the infrastructure.\"\n\"Correct. All right? We retreat until we're clear of the Mothers, then we go tribal.\"\n\nThe third story takes us to St. Bertoline's church, in Barthomley, 1643, when the Irish are invading the countryside. It's much like \"The Crucible\" in terms of a love triangle mixed with religious fervor, and it ties in with the other stories with a stone artifact that appears throughout the novel.\n\nA single bell began to ring over the parish.\n\"Is it church time already?\" said Margery.\n\"No. My father. He thinks we'll be up against reasonable men.\"\n\"Have you seen them?\"\n\"Nearly. I rode down through Crewe by Oak Farm. They'd not left any alive. I must go and stop that bell. They'll find us soon enough.\"\n\nThere's profound connections between these characters I won't reveal here, but the novel weaves questions of identity, time, and the bond between the three couples to the point where the book doesn't always mark where one scene ends and another begins. Early editions were marketed young adult, and yet it's as adult and dense as a Salinger story or Shakespeare.\n\nThe novel ends on a heartbreaking note, leaving you in wonder as to what exactly happened, and yet that's exactly the charm and strength of the work - like rich poetry, you need to read it more than once to get all the meaning, and even then there's much beyond your reach. It's a challenging work, and at a scant 120 pages, maintains the tension all the way through.\n\nFor readers outside England, here's some pointers on British words: a caravan is a military trailer, nesh is being very sensitive to cold weather or simply lacking courage, a folly is a castle built for decoration, cans are headphones, M6 can be both a highway and a star cluster, M33 is a spiral galaxy, and \"Tom's a-cold\" is from \"King Lear.\"  Also, image searches of Crewe and Mow Cop would give an idea of the setting, but don't read the Introduction or look up the meaning of the coded message until you've finished the book.\n\nTo sum up, captivating and cryptic, with realistic, unique characters and situations, all presented with a masterful use of mystery and suspense. Add to that spell-binding dialogue, rich with layer on layer, and it's a work that resonates with you long after.","summary":"Challenging, Grim, and Compelling","unixReviewTime":1265500800,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

So much is lost along the way - and although there is some survival at the end, what kind of survival is it?\n\nThere are three interwoven stories, spanning three points in time and one in space - the times are the later Roman Empire in Britain, the British Civil War of the 17th century, and the modern age.  The space is a part of Cheshire around an iconic hill, Mow Cop. And the three are linked - apart from their biting emotional motifs -  by an object, a prehistoric axe head, that appears in all, a talisman of the ages.\n\nIn the earliest thread, a ragged remnant of a Roman legion - just a few soldiers, conscripts from who-knows-where - have to deal with the wild and ancient tribes, as vicious and crafty as the soldiers. Wonderfully, Garner has made them talk the lingo of modern squaddies, because that's how they would have sounded to each other. In the Civil War, villagers take refuge in a church from the prowling band of enemy - but not all the hatred is political...In today's world, a near-genius innocent, a sacred fool (who quotes Lear's lines for Tom the fool) is paired with a girl above his social level and distrusted by his parents: there are no swords here, but \"words\" is an anagram of \"sword\" and the pain is the same.\n\nIncredible tight, elliptical exchanges: you may have to read a page twice to \"get\" everything that is happening (and then you won't be sure). American readers may have a problem with the British idiom of the 70's and some archaic words of the Civil War times, and the Cheshire idiom, but it's worth it.","summary":"Bitter, subtle, complex","unixReviewTime":1134950400,"vote":17.0,"image":null}

Depew","reviewText":"It's difficult enough to get a high school student interested in probabilty.  It's nearly impossible to get an adult to understand the workings of probability theory.  Sometimes I think that if I hear the \"Law of Averages\" invoked one more time by an aggressive driver or a lottery player, I'll scream.  I wish there were some way to teach the average human being about probability.\n\n\"Lightning\" is a good start.  It does not read like a textbook.  It presents the ideas behind probability using object lessons and examples that even the dullest layman can relate to.  It introduces the concepts first, using concrete examples such as lottery winnings and crime statistics, and then presents the abstract principle behind the concepts, and attaches the proper technical labels to the concepts and the principle.\n\nThe author introduces the reader early to the idea of a \"Probability Perspective,\" a new way to look at the world through eyes that understand probability.  The author returns constantly to this theme of the Probability Perspective, with the expectation that by the end of the book the reader will understand what is meant by the term, and will have claimed such a perspective as his own.\n\nSome of the chapters can be read independently, and some build on previous chapters.  It's most useful to read the book from cover to cover.  The final chapter is a carefully disguised \"final exam,\" at the end of which the readers can decide for themselves whether they have acquired a Probability Perspective.\n\nThe language of the book is appropriate for a high school senior or a college student, and is easily readable by an adult.\n\nThe only problem with the book is not the book itself, but the subject.  Most people will judge the book by its cover (or at least by its subject) and, thinking that probability is either boring or difficult to understand, will pass by this book on their way to something with more cachet.  They're missing out on a good read.","summary":"Easy for the layman to understand","unixReviewTime":1226188800,"vote":18.0,"image":null}

Schultz","reviewText":"This book is written in short, digestible bites, and offers one of the best overview answers I've read to everyone's perennial question, \"What are the odds?\"\n\nEarly chapters are a primer on casino games. In less than an hour, you can read up on how the major casino games are played, how to calculate your odds of winning in many common situations - and how much you will lose on every play on average if you play for any length of time. Rosenthal emphasizes this last proviso. He shows how EVERY casino game is stacked against the players and will whittle away your stake to nothing in the long run. But some games offer better odds and will deplete you less rapidly than other games.\n\nThen Rosenthal moves on to tell you how to win at the game of life - or more precisely, how not to be caught up in the frequent illogic and hysteria that is generated by headline news and TV shows. He gives a better perspective on what kinds of dangers you are likely to actually face - and they are not terrorists or SARS or street crime.\n\nA few more mathematically challenging topics are addressed  - such as the Monty Hall dilemma, and how trends are spotted using linear regression lines. Rosenthal makes the calculation of p-values (used to determine how often a result will happen just by chance) almost comprehensible.\n\nSome of his suggestions about using utility theory when we have to reach a decision may be of questionable value. Probably many of us have tried to make decisions \"rationally\" by using some formula that involves assigning some level-of-desirability number to each of our options, then considering how likely it is that the benefits of that option will actually materialize. But such calculations usually break down almost immediately in the maze of diverging possibilities we have to consider.\n\nHowever one of Rosenthal's applications of utility theory stands up and has implications for public policy. He shows how statistics lead to the conclusion that it is unreasonably costly to insure oneself against anything except utter catastrophes. This section of his book is something everyone should consider when buying insurance, especially health insurance. And it's something our elected officials in particular should inform themselves about before proposing any health care legislation.\n\nRosenthal provides other valuable insights that might shield us and reassure us when facing health care issues. For example, he demonstrates how statistically unlikely it is that you have a certain disease if just one test for that disease comes back positive. For further statistical discussions of this counterintuitive fact, I recommend any of Marilyn vos Savant's books.\n\n\"Struck by Lightning\" provides ample insight on its own though. It's entertaining, and it contains information you're very likely to use in everyday life.","summary":"This Book is a Good Bet","unixReviewTime":1174262400,"vote":34.0,"image":null}

He eats\/ drinks everything including ALL Daddy's beer!  If only they'd had some tiger food in the house...\n\nI find this book really captures childrens' imaginations as they try to work out what they would do in this situation.  There are also quite a few valid and intelligent questions, such as how can you drink all the water out of the taps? Why would a tiger prefer Sophie's sandwiches to Sophie herself? Would a tiger get drunk from drinking beer?  (Some of these questions are from older kids than the intended audience...)\n\nThis whimsical old-fashioned story has a European feel with the landscape and clothing - there is also something decidedly old-fashioned about the family structure with Daddy at work all day (and the \"Ta-da!\" pose when he arrives home from work), but this does not detract from the story for me.  If it bothers you, you can talk about how family dynamics are different now, although careful not to spoil the magic possibility that a tiger could possibly come to tea.","summary":"Magical possibilities and endless questions...","unixReviewTime":1408752000,"vote":null,"image":null}

After some research about the popularity of this book, I found out that it was written in 1968. So  those who complain about the outdated parts have a proper basis on that claim.\n\nIt is not the most educating child book that we have bought. More recent books generally work on a theme and try to teach children a good behavior or help them avoid dangers in the life. Compared to those books, this is rather a fairy tale style book with so many absurd stuff.\n\nThe story contains Sophie, her mother and the tiger as the main characters and the daddy as a secondary character. While the daddy is at work, little Sophie and her mother were having tea time and the door knocked. Upon opening the door they saw a giant tiger as the uninvited guest. They called him in and offered some tea. The tiger graciously accepted and started eating and drinking everything on the table. Not only that, he consumed everything in the fridge and drank all the water too. Then he thanked and left leaving a mess behind. When daddy came home there was nothing to eat or drink so they went to dine outside and the next day they replenished their pillaged food stocks. This time they included a tin of tiger food (whatever that is) hoping that the tiger would come again but he never did.\n\nThat plotline is based on a working dad and housewife mom which may be the norm 46 years ago, but it is not fair to criticize this books on this point saying that it does not work like that anymore. (Then we should never be reading books written over 20 years ago including world classics... Sorry Hemingway...)\n\nHowever the story would be better if it did not mention about an alcoholic drink (tiger drank daddy's beer too) in a child book. That is an inconsiderate point but I still will not dock a star from my rating because of this. I read the book and skip that part.\n\nBoth my son and daughter loved this book and we even had to buy it again when the first one was torn apart in their hands, it helped them sit down and listen to stories and love books at least by looking at the pictures. No matter how absurd the story is and how inconsiderate it was written, I am happy for this purchase and I think it deserves the reputation...","summary":"outdated? yes, absurd? yes, inconsiderately written? yes; but my kids love listening to it again and again...","unixReviewTime":1405728000,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

Despite his own grievous injuries, I think Douglas Bader's struggles and victories with his own disabilities are so inspirational that any person, soldier or citizen will be inspired by both his recovery and stellar life achievements.  Imagine losing both legs in the 1930's - 40's, a time when there was little expertise in rehabilitation and artificial limbs.  Imagine then going back to flying after such a horrible crash, then excelling during the Battle of Britain, being shot down, captured and not just being a willing prisoner, but making numerous escapes only to be recaptured.  The man was such a character! Attitude is everything.  Douglas Bader had such a will to survive and to live a great life, not just an ordinary one.\n\nSo, I am buying another copy for myself to read and reread.

Although lots of people swear by the Molecular Biology of the Cell, 4th Edition (Bruce Alberts et al... and I own that one too), I found it too wordy and not as fun to read. This book however is lucidly written and has everything that a graduate student or senior undergrad would need to know in Cell Biology.\n\nI used Cell and Molecular Biology (I just called it Gerald Karp after the author) extensively during my undergrad and am still using it in graduate school (I'm getting my Masters in Microbiology).\n\n Cell and Molecular Biology by Gerald Karp is surpassed only in diagram clarity and simplicity by Cooper and Hausman's \"The Cell: A Molecular Approach\" which has the best diagrams of all cell biology textbooks but is slightly less comprehensive (I own that one too!). The book is neatly arranged and the continuity of topics within a chapter and from chapter to chapter is very good unlike Molecular Biology of the Cell, 4th Edition.\n\nAlthough sold separately for something like $38.00, the book has an associated study workbook sort of thing with it that is pretty good for testing your knowledge in the important and tricky concepts. For every chapter in the textbook there is a section of multiple choice questions, a section of experimental-data interpretation questions, a section of thought questions, and explain the role of each of the following\" type questions. All questions except the thought questions come with answers. And there is a review of the key topics in the textbook for every chapter. I would greatly recommend buying the text and the study book together, especially if you're gearing to take exams like the Subject GRE.","summary":"Comprehensive without being overwhelming","unixReviewTime":1201392000,"vote":17.0,"image":null}

He was shot down in 1943 and drew on his experiences as a prisoner of war to write books. Douglas Bader learned at an early age to stand up for himself in the school system. He excelled in sports and won a scholarship. Bader had the athlete's coordination of eye, mind, and muscle that made a skilled airman. An accident nearly killed him. His left leg was amputated below the knee, his right leg above the knee. After being fitted with prosthetic devices Bader learned to walk again, and to drive a car. Then he flew a fighter again. But the Air Council forced him to retire. Bader found a job, and married Thelma. They were happy.\n\nIn September 1939 Bader re-applied for flying and was accepted if he passed the flying tests. He educated the newer pilots in tactics. Bader was promoted to the command of a Canadian squadron. Bader advised using large formations against the incoming enemy. Leigh-Mallory agreed. Bader advised breaking up the enemy formations by having fighters dive into their midst, the separation made them vulnerable. The success led to added squadrons. The German losses stopped their plans to invade Britain. Then Germany switched to night bombing. In time his luck ran low, his plane was hit, and Bader parachuted into France and captivity. Fatigue leads to mistakes. Bader's handicap made it unlikely he could escape from captivity. These chapters describe his life as a prisoner in Germany. In April 1945 the American Army arrived at Kolditz and freed the prisoners.\n\nThe `Interim Prologue' tells what happened after Bader left the Air Force. He worked and traveled for an oil company. He visited and encouraged those who had needed to learn how to walk again. Bader was classed as the best fighter pilot and tactician of World War II.","summary":"The Legless Ace of The Battle of Britain","unixReviewTime":1174867200,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

He became a leading ace until he was shot down, and then he became such a pain to the Germans that they had to take his legs away from him to stop him from escaping.\nYou may remember Brickhill as the author of The Great Escape. This is another spellbinding yarn. Note however that it is more of an inspirational story than a serious biography.

Instead of being a compilation of all of the things that Paddington experienced, as noted throughout the series, this book is more about how his parents met their horrible end and why he ended up with Aunt Lucy in Darkest Peru, before he stowed away to England. The content was upsetting to my Paddington fan. So if you're expecting bits from Paddington's trips with Mr. Gruber or about an adventure with Judy, be prepared instead for a Peruvian earthquake. You know what? Spare your Paddington fan the heartbreak and keep the wonder and happiness of Paddington intact. Because there is no one like him and no one can bring joy like he can.

The idea is that a mouse shows Mr. Bird the inside of a \"people house,\" where there are not only standard things like doors and ceiling but also more interesting objects like roller skates and doughtnuts.\nWritten by Dr. Seuss under his Theo. LeSieg pseudonym, used when somebody else besides Theodore Geisel was doing the artwork, this book simply provides beginning readers with over 60 different nouns.  Illustrated by Roy McKie, \"In a People House\" is intended to give kids the words to go with the objects they are likely to see around the house.  The book is essentially a list, manipulated so that the rhyme works, so for the most part kids are going to find words like \"pencil\" and \"toothbrush\" next to drawings of the mouse or Mr. Bird with the object.\nThis approach here is simple and effective.  Since the objects you are likely to find \"In a People House\" have not changed all that significantly since this book was first published in 1972 it is still going to do the job it was created for three decades later.  Young kids should be able to find the words in this book that go with the objects in their house, and being able to \"look up\" words in a book is a great skill for them to learn as well.","summary":"Theo.

Before he died, Dr. Seuss was working on a book about teaching.  He couldn't get it quite right because \"Miss Bonkers was driving him bonkers.\"  After his death, the material was passed along to his long-time editor who filed it away.  One day she had the good thought of inviting talented poet, Jack Prelutsky, and outstanding illustrator, Lane Smith, to complete the project.  The book shows you the Seuss sketches and his work in progress. It's really quite interesting.  Prior to the origins section, you get the actual story.  The result is a book that is a combination of wonderful children's story and multifaceted paean to Dr. Seuss.\nDr. Seuss's books are wonderful for celebrating differences among children.  This book moves beyond that excellent base to point out the benefits of differences among adults as well as children.  The creation of Flobbertown (where everyone does everything the same, and life is dreary) is a stroke of genius, for it creates an archetype to react against.\nNear when the poem begins, a student is speaking.  \"My teacher is Miss Bonkers, She's as bouncy as a flea . . . I'm glad she teaches me.\"  That's the sort of sincere flattery all teachers should receive from their students.\nMiss Bonkers's specialization is summarized as follows, \"Miss Bonkers teaches EVERYTHING!\"  She's a free spirit, as evidenced by her use of a trampoline.  She does her own thing, and the principal (who worries a lot) \"treats her like a queen.\"  Most teachers would love that kind of support, as well!\nThe rest of the teaching and support staff are equally unique and interesting in their own ways.  While many children's stories stick just to the main story line, this one develops many characters to establish a sense of place and context that build a very solid base for the plot.\nWorking from \"some characters, a setting, and a few verses\" the story revolves around the benefits of teaching children to think for themselves.  This is a good theme, because you can use it as a starting point to encourage your children do the same.  The story does a nice job of providing an interesting and amusing tale, with contemporary references that make it more relevant.\nAs much as I liked the poetry and its imaginative interweaving with Dr. Seuss's original thoughts, I must say I was even more impressed with the illustrations.  You will see a vivid, exciting, Seuss-like world, yet this place is distinct from Dr. Seuss.  But, Lane Smith incorporated many images from Dr. Seuss into the details for the illustrations, like cut-outs from the newspaper in a Picasso collage.  The result is rather intriguing and richer than either style alone would be.\nAfter you have finished enjoying the story with your child, I suggest that you encourage your child to notice the \"invisible\" people in her or his life.  What are they like?  What are they focusing on?  How can thinking for themselves make a difference?\nEncourage independent thinking!","summary":"A Seuss-Based Collage","unixReviewTime":984009600,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

Bennett","reviewText":"I loved Dr. Seuss as a kid, but I have to admit, I don't always like reading him aloud now that I'm a parent. Don't tell my kids, but I know how  Green Eggs and Ham ended up behind the sofa. Mom and Dad hid it there after  they'd been forced to read about boxes and foxes and sockses too many times  in a row one night. This new book, based on notes and sketches found among  Dr. Seuss's papers after his death, might escape the fate of Sam-I-am, at  least in our house.  There are some definite funny moments.  Discussing the cafeteria workers, the narrator says, \"They make us hot  dogs, beans, and fries, \/ Plus things we do not recognize.\" Although  the food may resemble that found in some educational institutions, the  philosophy does not. Instead of teaching the students the traditional canon  and rote memorization, the teachers at Diffendoofer teach an eclectic mix.  Extolling the virtues of his teacher, Miss Bonkers, the narrator says:  She even teaches frogs to dance.  And pigs to put on  underpants.  One day she taught a duck to sing --  Miss  Bonkers teaches EVERYTHING!  Of all the teachers in our school,  I like Miss Bonkers best.  Our teachers are all different,  But she's different-er than the rest.  Most of  all, the teachers teach their students how to think. This works great,  until the day of the dreaded standardized test. If the students at  Diffendoofer School don't pass with flying colors, they'll be forced to go  to Flobbertown, where everyone does everything the same. Amazingly enough,  the test covers all the things the Diffendoofer teachers have been teaching  -- and for those questions on material they haven't covered yet, the  students use their thinking skills to come up with the right answers.  Lane Smith's illustrations pay tribute to Dr. Seuss. Several characters  from Seuss books walk the halls of Diffendoofer School, along with Smith's  more angular characters. The library is stocked with Seuss books.  At the end of the book, there's the story of how this book came to be.  After reading the original verses and studying the original sketches, I  re-read the story and marveled at how Prelutsky and Smith took a small  amount of material and fashioned Hooray for Diffendoofer Day.","summary":"If Number 2 pencils make you cringe . . .","unixReviewTime":966384000,"vote":26.0,"image":null}

I'd gladly send my children to a school where a sprited teacher named Miss Bonkers makes learning a delightful adventure everyday. (\"She even teaches frogs to dance, and  pigs to put on underpants.\") I purchased this book with great  enthusiasm because I was intrigued by the fact that Theodore \"Dr.  Seuss\" Geisel never had a chance to finish the story; only a handful  of rough illustrations and verses existed. After Dr. Seuss passed away in  1991, his editor of 11 years, Janet Schulman, passed on the rough draft to  Jack Prelutsky (a wonderful children's poet) and Lane Smith (an amazing  illustrator with a surreal style). This brave team stepped up to the  enormous challenge of fleshing out Dr. Seuss's story.\nPrelutsky continues  the Seussian tradition of wacky words and rhymes, a delight for the young  and old. Children love the hilarious descriptions of all the folks who run  Diffendoofer School, from the nurse, Miss Clotte, to the stressed-out  principal, Mr. Lowe, whose \"face is wrinkled as a prune from worrying  so much.\"\nParents will appreciate the not-so-subtle pun on  high-stakes assessment tests. The Diffendoofer kids are positively thrilled  when they see that the test has \"questions about noodles, about  poodles, frogs, and yelling...about other things we'd never seen or heard,  and we somehow answered them, enjoying every word.\" Dr. Seuss,  Prelutsky, and Smith have created a book that celebrates the creative mind  and the joy of learning.\nThe illustrations by Lane Smith are touched  with a lighthearted surrealism. Each page is cotten candy for the eyes. In  a touching and unique homage to Dr. Seuss, Smith included original Seuss  drawings in many illustrations. It's fun to simply look at Smith's  illustrations and try to remember in which books the Seuss drawings  appeared.\nAnother treat for the Seuss fan comes after the story.  Schulman, Seuss's editor, wrote \"How this Book Came to Be,\" which  includes many of Seuss's original rough sketches and handwritten text. It's  a rare opportunity for one to peer into the mind of a brilliant writer.\nI simply love reading this book to my children. Three cheers for Dr.  Seuss, Jack Prelutsky, and Lane Smith!","summary":"It's gribbulous, it's grobbulous! A must-have!","unixReviewTime":960336000,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

It's a terrible thing as Dr. Seuss takes a look at conformity versus freedom! Dr. Seuss created Hooray for Diffendoofer Day!, and Jack Prelutsky finished this story while Lane Smith did the illustrations. A picture book for children ages 48.\n\nMy Take\nThe kids will love this! There are lots of opportunities for laughing and coming up with ideas for other kinds of classes besides the ones that Miss Bobble and Miss Fribble teachamong others. There's Miss Clotte's overzealousness and Mr. Plunger's inventiveness. Yep, lots of opportunities to be imaginative with the kids!\n\nIt's also a chance for the kids to imagine what classes in smelling, tasting, and listening would teach. A chance for parents to come up with unique ideas to get the kids to do what you want them to and good luck with that one!\n\nI do love the colors, they're so softly funky with weird angles to buildings and people and lots of stripes and polka dots and swirlies and whirlies. Smith was definitely influenced by the modern art of his day, lol. I swear, you could spend one day for each spread of pages, stretching the imagination, exploring the bits floating throughout.\n\nThe blurb calls it \"a joyous ode to individuality, starring an unsinkable teacher named Miss Bonkers and quirky little Diffendoofer School, which must prove it has taught its students how to think.\"\n\nThe individuality is more implied and only becomes obvious [to me!] when Flobbertown comes up.\n\nAbout half the book (at the back) is devoted to explaining how Hooray for Diffendoofer Day! came to be. It includes Seuss' original drawings, which are very Seuss-like. Quite different from the characters Smith did, and I think I like Smith's better??! I suspect it's the artist side in me, *laughing*.\n\nThe namesthe nameslol Oh, yeah, it's a buy for sure!\n\nThe Story\nOh, Diffendoofer is the school I'd choose where learning is fun, and it's learning to think. But then the day comes, the day Mr. Lowe has been dreading.\n\nWorried and fretting, he doesn't want Diffendoofer School to close!\n\nThe Characters\nDiffendoofer School is\non the corner of Dinkzoober and Dinkzott in Dinkerville. The teachers include the Misses Bobble, Wobble, Fribble, Quibble, Twining, Vining, and Bonkers (who's different-er than the rest). The sad Mr. Lowe is the worried principal. Miss Clotte is the nurse. Mr. Plunger is the custodian, that's janitor to you and I. Mr. Fox is the music teacher while Mr. Beeze teaches art. Mr. Katz teaches science with his robotic rats. As the gym teacher, Mr. Bear is quite strong. And Miss Loon is quite the opposite of the usual librarian. The three McMunches do the cooking. I don't think the Board of Health would be too happy about all that hair, lol.\n\nThe Cover and Title\nThe cover has a heavy cream color with large darker cream polka dots. The author's name is large in a deep blue while the title is in rust and Miss Bonkers is on the cover in her signature orange and speckled beige striped dress and black high-top shoes. I'd be careful of her mouth though, it's either a zipper or short fangs!\n\nThe title is so perfect. It's definitely a Hooray for Diffendoofer Day! as the Diffendoofer students save the day.","summary":"Be and think for yourself in Seuss' take on individuality","unixReviewTime":1456704000,"vote":null,"image":null}

It's always a treat for Grandpa to come home at the end of the day and listen to this or that new word they learned to say.  When it came time for our younger grandson's first Christmas, he was just 9 months old.  Grandpa & I thought it would be a better idea - since we already had an overabundance of toddler toys in the house that our older grandson no longer played with - to have his gifts that year be the beginning of a complete collection of Dr. Seuss books.  The older one (4 year age difference) was able to start enjoying the \"Beginner Books\" series (age 4-8) immediately, and the (now 22 month old) younger one has graduated from board books to this hardcover \"Bright and Early Books\" series, with the clever tag line of being \"for Beginning Beginners\" (age 3 & under).\n\n\"In a People House\" was the fourth of a dozen Dr. Seuss books in this series... this one is actually written under one of the pen names used by Theodor Geisel for books he authored but didn't illustrate, Theo. LeSieg (Geisel - otherwise known as Dr. Seuss - spelled backward).  This one is illustrated by Roy McKie, and it's a funny, very colorful look at a mouse inviting a bird into a \"People House\" to explore - albeit a bit chaotically! - all of the interesting things there are to be found in this foreign land.  If I counted correctly, there are 64 common household items for your little one to learn (with the 65th being the PEOPLE who live there who don't particularly care for mice and birds making a mess of their house!)  Again, I don't have a million other things going on in my life right now, so it's actually enjoyable to be at a stage where - when my younger grandson opens a drawer and starts taking things out - I have the luxury of time (and a bit more patience) to be able to use it as an opportunity to teach him what things are called instead of just saying \"No, no, no!\"\n\nIn case you're interested, the other books in the series are:  \"The Foot Book\", \"The Eye Book\", \"Mr. Brown Can Moo!  Can You?\", \"Marvin K. Mooney Will You Please Go Now!\", \"The Shape of Me and Other Stuff\", \"The Pop-Up Mice of Mr. Brice\", \"There's a Wocket in My Pocket!\", \"Great Day for Up\", \"Would You Rather Be a Bullfrog?\", \"Hooper Humperdink...?  Not Him!\", and \"The Tooth Book\".","summary":"For young minds that are like little sponges, here's a fun 65 word vocabulary to learn!","unixReviewTime":1390608000,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

Even though he never got to complete this book before his death, the book stays true to the ideas he had for the book and the combined authors and illustrators have done an excellent job in finishing the work that Dr. Seuss started.\n\nIn this day and age where everything seems to be done in a cookie cutter fashion, and standardized everything seems to be the norm, this book takes a look at what it would be like if a child could go to a school where the learning takes place over end of grade testing, or learning for the sake of a test score.  The teachers show kids that learning can be fun, and the teachers are anything but ordinary.  They go way beyond thinking outside the box to teach the children the things they need to learn, and imaginations run wild.  If there was a school that existed that taught the way these teachers do, I would be first in line to sign my kids up!  My son absolutely loves this book and he even thinks it would be cool to have a teacher like Miss Bonkers!\n\nAs an added bonus, the back of the book shows the work that Dr. Seuss had done for this book, along with hand written text and pictures.  While my son does not really have an interest in that part of the book, I thoroughly enjoyed looking at the process he used to create a book.  If I could give this book 6 stars, I would.

They dress in just one style.  They sing one song, they never dance, they march in single file . . . Their lunches have no taste at all, Their dogs are scared to bark.\"  Naturally, the Diffendoofer creative thinking students rally to save the day and the school.  The characters are quirky but all too real.  I particularly like giving this book to young people to encourage their spirit and creativity, as a preemptive strike against the peer-pressured conformity of adolescence.

{"overall":3,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"10 21, 2017","reviewerID":"A3L4TODGKQWRA1","asin":"0001720392","style":{"Format:":" Hardcover"},"reviewerName":"Cassandra Gelvin - DRTTMK","reviewText":"I'm not really sure what to think about this book. I mean, I read it when I was a kid; I had it read to me. It's a classic book. But I'm trying to look at it with fresh eyes.\n\nIt's well-written. It's well-rhymed. It's funny. The pictures are amusing. But the story basically boils down to this: a character, who is never named, is sitting reading a newspaper. This other guy, Sam, keeps rushing by him with signs on various animals, annoying him, and it's unclear why Sam's doing it, and then he offers the main character green eggs and ham. The main character replies that he doesn't like them, at which point Sam begins a litany of questions at this guy. \"Would you like them here or there?\" \"Would you like them in a house?\" \"Would you like them in a car?\" Sam just follows the guy around, going through these ridiculous situations, trying to get him to eat this frankly moldy-looking food. At the end, they end up falling in the ocean (I think) with the main character, again, vehemently denying that he likes this food, like he's got some kind of thing to prove about it or something, and then Sam finally suggests to the main character that he try them. The main character says, \"If you will let me be\/I will try them, you will see.\" Basically, \"If eating this food is what it takes to get you to leave me alone and stop destroying my life with all this random crap going on, I will.\" And then he eats them, and he likes them.\n\nI think it's supposed to be a metaphor for trying to get children to try new foods, because children will often deny that they like something without ever having tried it. Most adults don't claim to dislike a food before they've ever tried it. I guess children do sometimes come up with strange rules about when and where they will eat certain things (and I guess I do know of at least one adult who refuses to eat hot dogs unless she is at a baseball game). Taken in that light, it makes a lot of sense. Taken the way the world works for adults, it's basically one person harassing another person, until they consume dangerous-looking food. That would be like chasing somebody around, practically assaulting them with animals and vehicles, until they agree to eat leftover tuna that's been in the fridge for who knows how long.\n\nAgain, as I said, if you take it from the perspective that a child will likely take it, I'm probably reading too much into it. A child will look at it and think, \"Oh, there's a lot of food I don't like, and my parents sometimes resort to ridiculous lengths in order to get me to eat food that I claim to not like, and it sometimes turns out that I like it,\" so I think they'll identify with that. I guess the important part is that the main character does like it.\n\nBut there's no real reason given in the story for Sam to be an authority on food. In fact, in the beginning the main character says he doesn't even like Sam. There's no reasons given for anything in this book, at all. You can make up your own reason. You can say that Sam is trying to give the main character a gift of something that Sam really, really, likes, knowing it's not dangerous, but declines to explain that to the main character. And the main character thinks it looks dangerous, but declines to explain that to Sam. Despite the entire text being dialogue, there's not enough communication going on in this book. It kind of reminds me of the conversations I have with my own toddlers, so I guess it's accurate.\n\nThe message is kind of mixed from a modern perspective. Again, the book is very well written, the rhymes are excellent, and the meter is impeccable. Dr. Seuss: great writer. I'm just not sure I agree with the message of this book.\n\nMessage: Try new foods. Or, if you keep annoying somebody enough, they'll give in to what you're asking for.\n\nFor more children's book reviews, see my website at drttmk dot com.","summary":"In the words of Ponyo, \"HAM!\"","unixReviewTime":1508544000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Every child immediately perceives that green eggs and ham are just gross, very much like the disgusting food that strange adults try to get you to eat. In this case it turns out the stuff is essentially candy, but the narrator is right to refuse it up to the end.\n\nThere seems to be some confusion about the publication date of this book. I know people who had it at least as early as 1959, yet we keep seeing an Aug 1960 date for the 1st edition. Either this claim is in error, or the publisher distributed copies of it 18 months before the nominal, official publication date.

It's almost Dorothy-like in its ending\n\nMy Take\nWatch where you're walkin'!\nIt's a hazardous journey through life with problems popping and flitting, darting and biting, raining and flooding  without toothpaste or soap! And, poor Cat. His journey is so much longer than he expectedand isn't that the way for all of us.\n\nIt's a series of troubles that gets deeper and deeper, from a camel needing a ride, to the nastier part of that particular lesson and right down deeper into the tunnel under Pamplemoose.\n\nI do enjoy the colors Seuss uses in his books. They're rarely primary colors, but more nuanced and normally consistently used throughout the story. In I Had Trouble in Getting to Solla Sollew, Suess was totally inconsistent in his colors. Some were deep and grayed while others were bright and cheery. It could be a reflection of Cat's experiences as he travels.\n\nIf nothing else, I always enjoy the scenes and characters that Seuss creates.\n\nI certainly did like the button-like flowers outside that trap door. That field of flowers almost paled, though, when the city of Solla Sollew appeared with its towers and arches and frivolity too.\n\nI Had Trouble in Getting to Solla Sollew is a microcosm of life, as Cat discovers there are hidden perils everywhere and that running away from your problems doesn't necessarily get you in the clear.\n\nThe Story\nRocks, the evil-minded, green-headed Quilligan Quail, a Skirtz, and a Skrink pop up from all directions, leaving Cat thinking this chap in his One-Wheeler Wubble has the answers to his troubles.\n\nIt's a hard lesson to learn, and not so hard to go back.\n\nThe Characters\nCat is from the Valley of Vung.\n\nDr. Sam Snell knows all about camels.\n\nButch Meyers is the usual bus driver. Horace P. Sweet is the bus line president.\n\nGeneral Genghis Khan Schmitz inducts Cat into his army to battle the Perilous Poozer of Pompelmoose Pass.\n\nThe naughty Key-Slapping Slippard can't be killed, as the Doorman moans.\n\nThe Midwinter Jicker is a nasty rainy sort of storm.\n\nThe Cover and Title\nThe cover has a white background and is framed by a Seussian blob of deep pink that starts as a lumpy hillside on the left tumbling down to the bottom of the cover only to rise up as a long swaying trunk with a high umbrella-like canopy at the very top. Calmly stepping from hillock to hillock is a bright yellow camel hitched to a blue One-Wheeler Wubble to which a rusty looking Cat is clinging.\n\nThe title sums up that I Had Trouble in Getting to Solla Sollew.","summary":"Not one of my faves...","unixReviewTime":1473984000,"vote":null,"image":null}

It helped that there was a great promotional price at the time but the real motivator was to have them for my, at that time, infant grandson to read.\n\nFast forward a couple of years and I realized that while the Kindle version is great to have (especially when on-the-go), nothing really replaces having the actual book in hand for a toddler.  My grandson is now almost three years old and can handle the delicate process of turning thin, paper pages.  He loves to sit and read books to himself or to his baby sister.  Because of this new realization, I have decided to pick up the books in this series in hardback format.\n\nGreen Eggs and Ham is one of the wonderful books I remember from my own childhood and I love the book's rhymes and illustrations.  It was one of the Dr. Seuss books that I purchased and read to my children when they were young.  We still have those old books but I gave them to my daughters when they moved away from home so they could keep an important piece of their childhood with them.  I now get to have the opportunity to buy them again and enjoy reading them to a new generation.","summary":"A Classic children's book that I own both in Kindle and hardback version","unixReviewTime":1469923200,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

We were celebrating  Dr. Seuss's birthday and we could not have a celebration without having Green Eggs and Ham.  The children absolutely loved the book.  They learned the phrases that were repeated and would start repeating them with me.  I loved watching them learn thru reading. It is amazing what 3 year olds can learn if you give them the opportunity.  The Cd was great as well.  I have it playing during play time and they will stop and listen and repeat the parts they know while playing.  You know you have a great book when they stop playing to interact with it.

It is hard to even label him as a children's author, because adults love his work as well. We just use our kids as the excuse to buy the books!\n\nGreen Eggs and Ham is certainly one of his classics that has been enjoyed by several generations of readers and it is easy to see why. His books are fun to read and look at. The characters start in a simple setting but quickly progress into some silly adventure in a world that only Seuss could come up with and make so enjoyable for others. The rhyming flows wonderfully and it is fun to read out loud and play with pace of voice. Kids giggle and ask for more. Those who can't yet read, still like to look at the pages and do their best to from memory. Green Eggs and Ham aces the entertainment factor.\n\nI almost gave it 5 stars. Even now, it feels somewhat sacrilegious to take it down to only four stars. It feels wrong in the way some people feel about a kid not being allowed to eat candy on Halloween. It's fun, shouldn't I just enjoy it? Maybe, but I am going to be a stick in the mud instead. We try to teach our kids that no means no and that peer pressure is bad. This book does not honor that. Sam is like the salesman that won't take no for an answer. He keeps pushing and pushing to close the deal. He does not let up when the other person starts getting angry. Finally, he gets him to break and try what he is offering. He doesn't just like what Sam gives him, he loves it. And that is another lesson we often try to teach. You won't know if you like it unless you try it. That is what I tell my kids about healthy foods. But that lesson is certainly not more important than the others. Sam was told no and he should have left it at that, allowing the other guy to come around on his own. I know it seems like such a minor thing, but our kids are listening. They find this book fun and a lot of kids also find it fun to pressure other kids to like what they like and do what they do even if the other isn't comfortable with it.\n\nDefinitely read this book with your kids. Have fun with it, celebrate the genius of Seuss, and then simply explain to them that we should respect other people's choices.","summary":"No Means No and the Matter of Peer Pressure","unixReviewTime":1443571200,"vote":null,"image":null}

It thus symbolizes the existential angst of modern life, wherein we are unfulfilled by modern life, and are repelled by something that might impart nourishment. The \"protagonist\" to be convinced of its desirability remains anonymous, while the other actor refers to himself with an emphatic identifier \"Sam I am\", formed with a pronominal subject and copular verb of existence. This character thus seeks to emphasize his existence and existential wholeness, and even establish a sense of self-existence, with an apparent Old Testament allusion to Elohim speaking to Moses as the \"I Am\". This emphatic personal identifier thus introduces a prominent theme of religious existentialism to the narrative, probably more in line with original Kierkegaardian religious existentialism, rather than later forms of existentialism that were less theocentric and more nihilistic and darker.\n\nThe anonymity of the protagonist speaks of his lack of personal existential identity or lack of spiritual fulfilment that results from his pursuit of ordinary modern life. The modernistic lifestyle requires, prescribes, and enforces standard, conventionalized modes of thought, such as insisting on standard eggs and ham, and deeming deviations from the norm as distasteful and to be avoided, a pirori, even though pursuit of non-orthodox forms of meaning in modern society might actually lead one to the fulfilment that one might be seeking as a lonely, nameless person. One might benefit from embracing the unconventional, but modern society has taught us to simply accept what everyone else likes and accepts and values, and we are unable to find happiness outside of the lonely conventional framework that the modern world imposes upon us. Thus, we are nameless, devoid of identity, and unable to see that the unconventional might actually impart meaning and joy to our otherwise mundane and futile existence.\n\nIn various mythologies, eggs denote fertility, and thus, new life and rebirth. Ham may indicate a strong source of nourishment and gustatory pleasure, but also, what was once ceremonially forbidden under older religious codes, but is now allowable (it is not clear to me if this change in religious dietary restrictions is a relevant part of the existential analogy that the author is attempting to convey, though). Both are rendered as green - verdant, the color of spring, life, nature, and growth. The religious symbolism is very apparent here, and perhaps also the author is playing with Jungian archetypes here to set up the religious existential elements. The food items being offered are not just a physical enjoyment or pursuit, but something of spiritual value, leading to renewal, growth, and sustenance at this higher level of existence. The protagonist rejects this offer outright, not realizing their spiritual benefits, not recognizing the higher level of existence and life to which he is called. He remains confined to the purely physical realm that he knows and understanding, refusing to recognize or embrace what lies beyond the material.\n\nThe protagonist declares he would not eat them here or there; in a house or with a mouse; in a box or with a fox; in a boat or with a goat; or in other localities or with other modes of transport, such as in a car, in the dark, in a plane, in the rain, and so forth. He rejects the pursuit of this nourishment in various modalities of modern life, in various locales, and in various social settings (with mice, foxes, goats, or even at home alone). The character dismisses pursuit of a lifestyle deemed unorthodox by modern or post-modern society in any locale or social realization. He refuses to think outside the box (\"not in a box, not with a fox\"), confining himself to his mere material existence. A sort of literary merism is employed here (part-whole metaphors that denote entirety, such as \"day and night\" meaning \"all the time\" in poetry). He excludes the possibility of eating it \"here or there or anywhere\" - an emphatic merism - or an any locality, or any mode of transport, that is, in any path of life, or going about his mundane, meaningless daily routine, he still rejects the offer. In whatever social circle, be it with creatures deemed dirty such as mice, or probably even alone at home - at home by himself in his existential despair, angst, and loneliness, in the location where he is most comfortable and most \"himself\" - he would reject this offer. In doing so, he also rejects the sharing of something substantive and spiritual with other social companions, and would instead prefer to be home or otherwise alone, accepting and (in a philosophically perverse way) enjoying his conventionalized, lonely, angst-driven life that modern society has imposed.\n\nSam continues to offer the unusual, greenish manna, and finally the protagonist relents and tries it. He undergoes a personal epiphany and spiritual transformation. He goes beyond his conventional existence and experiences for the first time an unconventional fulfillment. He has taken an existential leap of faith into something higher and deeper, rejecting hollow social norms and the materialistic values that society offers. He receives the new gift, the new enjoyment, with great joy and enthusiasm, and declare his desire to consume the product anywhere and everywhere, in whatever locale or social context, in whatever path of life (train, car, plane...) he finds himself. Thus, he makes a full commitment to that which lies beyond the material, conventional existence that humans know by nature, and fully and whole-heartedly embraces a radically different set of values and avenue of fulfilment.\n\nSam, as the one constantly offering the new experience, always begging him, always probing for a new situation or context (in boxes or houses, with fox or mice...) in which he might be willing to open his mind, serves a crucial mentor role. In fact, as such, and as one implying a self-existence with \"Sam I Am\", he serves as a literary Christ-figure or Christ-type. The nameless protagonist undergoes a spiritual and existential change, growth, and renewal. As such, he functions as an existential type of hero, one that undergoes an internal spiritual or personal transformation, takes a leap of faith, and finds a greater fulfllment beyond mundane social expectations. As an existential experience, it is perhaps hard for the reader to understand why such chromatically differentiated foodstuffs would become so enjoyable, so worthy of such enthusiastic embrace, that it is something that only one who personally experiences it, such as our hero here, can understand, and can only partially communicate to others. Likewise, the literary Christ-figure Sam could only offer it and express descriptively and experientially, not propositionally, about the desirability of the food items - a benefit that the hero was not capable of understanding or accepting until he himself tried it.\n\nThis existential leap of faith is perhaps reminiscent of Pascal's wager, wherein Blaise Pascal claimed that sometimes one comes to the point where one cannot accept or psychologically apprehend propositional truth about matters of faith, but one can only take a leap of faith, try faith oneself, try it experientially, before one can actually understand it or come to grips with it, in order to determine its reality and validity.","summary":"Fascinating portrait of existential despair","unixReviewTime":1441497600,"vote":null,"image":null}

What would you do?\" So it could really be a thinking experience too.\n\nBut this continues to puzzle me. I know the illustrations picture green eggs AND green ham.

Green Eggs and Ham is a great story. Toddlers love lifting flaps. But this book is even better than that. Many of the flaps are constructed very cleverly so that the flap, when opened, connects with and changes the illustration on the page to further the story. It really is a fun book for both children and adults to read. I highly recommend it for kids ages 18m - 5y.\n\nMy only complaint is that the book comes with a sheet of stickers, some of which are meant to be added to the last page. I wish that the last page just had the illustrations and that the stickers were just extra or not included at all. While we placed the stickers in their intended place, some of them have since been torn out so now the flaps are just empty.\n\nBut, that is a small complaint that shouldn't stop you from buying this great book.","summary":"Clever flaps and a great story","unixReviewTime":1419638400,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

He returns, but arms himself against the bad things that may come his way.\n\nThis book is one of the longer Dr. Seuss books so it may need more than one sitting to finish it.

During 80% of the book, the protagonist clearly says \"No\", but the substance dealer continues to pressure. In the end the protagonist is defeated, ingests the substance, and shows signs of addiction proclaiming outrageous ways in which he'll take this new substance. There is no evidence that the antagonist will continue to provide free samples of the substance once the main character is addicted.\nThis is done in rhyme & marketed to children. Many parents view this as a very positive book (as you can see from the reviews on Amazon). This author probably has 3 books in my top ten creepiest books of all time.

They rolled off the tongue and were easy to memorize and recite along with Mom or Dad, and it went on for such a long time with Sam I Am popping up in increasingly absurd places and situations to try to get the protagonist to try green eggs and ham. I was a little annoyed in later years that maybe Sam couldn't just take a hint and respect the main character's opinion--I mean heck, if he wants to live his life unaware of the glory that is eating green eggs and ham, it's his right, isn't it?--but considering he didn't really seem to have a reason to NOT try it except for sheer stubbornness, I didn't think this message was problematic.\n\nMy mother attempted to actually make eggs and ham green for us one time using food coloring, and I think we were kind of grossed out.","summary":"Yes, try new things!

Not only did he graduate from Dartmouth, but after his death, his family gave the Medical School a very large endowment. It is now known as the Geisel School Of Medicine. Green eggs and ham, may have very well sent many to seek medical advice.\n\nI wonder how many of our children remember this book, 'Green Eggs And Ham' as one of the first books in their memory. The vivid, colorful pictures, the rhyming rhyme of the words. The nonsense of it all hit their funny bones as much as it does for the adults. \"I do not like Green Eggs and Ham, I do not like it Sam I am\". How often every day do we hear those words? Never mind that fool of a Senator who read these books, that almost spoiled my day. But, we must overcome that foolish incident, and move on. I really do like eggs and ham, just not the green ones.\n\nThe entire set of books by Dr Seuss, is one of the heritages of our lives. Read them all, laugh out loud, have a good time.\n\nHighly Recommended. prisrob 10-17-13","summary":"I Really Do Like Eggs And Ham","unixReviewTime":1381968000,"vote":null,"image":null}

I had not read much Dr. Seuss since my own child, now 21, was young enough to still want to be read to, and even then, I am not sure Dr. Seuss was high on the \"must read list\" for him.  The reaction I had as I read this beloved children's  was a bit bewildering at first.  It was not until I \"stepped\" back into being a child that I understood why  this book is so powerful - myths teach us truth that we resist hearing.  Green Eggs and Ham is a parable that uses mythical creatures to speak a profound truth - if you don't try, you will never know.\n\"Sam-I-Am\" is the teacher who asks the only other character to try \"green eggs and ham,\" this wise, never named, wisely character refuses.  This character, like the reader, has learned that green food is not to be trusted.  To be offered such a dish from a stranger is to be completely disregarded.  But Sam is persistent, to say the least.  He asks for the dish to be tried in every conceivable location (in a house, on a train, in the rain), with various companions (a mouse being the most memorable) while chasing this \"Every Person\" seemingly around the world.  Finally (WARNING! Stop here if you do not want to know the ending of the book) this seemingly despicable entree is tasted and found to be very much liked.\nThe art work alone is worth gazing through this book.  To see how Dr. Seuss uses but 50 words to spin a tale of intrigue, tension, anxiety, resolution and fun is the reason it is still a vital part of children's literature 50 years after it was initially published.  Ernest Hemingway could have taken lessons from the good doctor on the minimalist school of writing.\nI was reminded of the parable of the persistent widow (Luke 18:1- 5) as I read this book.  Therein, the \"judge who did not fear God or what people thought\" was asked repeatedly by a widow for justice.  Widows' had no one to advocate for them and were at the mercy of others to survive.  Because she would not shut up, the judge gave her justice so he could feel safe.  The only way Sam would \"let go\" was for the green eggs and ham to be tasted, otherwise, the stranger would never be left alone.\n\nSuch persistence is tiring and no one likes to be nagged, but the point of this tale is not the payoff of constant begging, but the rewards of trying new things.  The world has changed a great deal in the last 50 years, it is not as safe as it was when Dr. Seuss penned these words.  One must be even more wary now than then, but one must never reach the point of being so fearful that everything is a danger.  I need Sam-I-Am in my world, to remind me of the possibility of new things.  I think I'll read The Lorax or One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish Blue Fish, what wonders await me there.","summary":"What is NOT to like?","unixReviewTime":1359504000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Stay with me for a moment, and I will tell you why.\nI've been in sales all my life, and the message that this book drives home so enthusiastically, so repetitively, so creatively, so effectively, and so simply that a child can appreciate it... is that you simply do not give up. You keep pushing for the order... \"Always Be Closing\". Statistically, two-thirds of all sales are made after the fifth closing attempt. If you are stopping short of a half-dozen closing attempts, you are walking away from the majority of your sales.\nI think U.S. President Calvin Coolidge put it best when he said:\n\"Nothing in the world can take the place of Persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.\"\nThis classic book encapsulates that with beautiful simplicity.\nNearly two decades ago, when I was the top seller of foundation waterproofing systems in the Eastern USA, (long before I started my own online business selling rare and antique Bibles for The Bible Museum, Inc. at GREATSITE DOT COM) my manager asked me if I would lead the sales meeting one day. He wanted me to explain to the other men, most of whom were twice my age, exactly how I keep setting national sales records every month. I agreed to lead the meeting the following week. I walked to the front of the room, and I told my fellow sales reps that I was about to give them my secret... the key to success in sales. I proceeded to read every word of this short book aloud to them. What at first were looks of bewilderment as to what on earth I was doing reading a children's book to a room full of adults... soon gave way to smiles and expressions of \"Oh... I get it... I see what he's doing.\" When I finished reading them every word of Green Eggs and Ham (which only took a few minutes), I said, \"That's it. That's my secret. Don't stop asking for the order.\" My manager led the room in a round of applause, and I sat down.\nYou should read this book. You should read it to your children","summary":"A Great Message:  Never Give Up","unixReviewTime":1352678400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Well, this book proves that it can be good advice.\n\nThe result of a bet with his publisher over whether he could create a book with a plot with only 50 words, this Dr. Seuss classic finds us following an argument between an unnamed character and Sam-I-Am.  Sam wants the other character to try green eggs and ham, and the other character refuses.  Sam keeps asking him to try to in new places or with new things, but he always refuses.  Will he give in?  What will happen when he does?\n\nOkay, so the limited number of words means the book gets repetitive.  Every refusal includes everything that's been said before.  But in true Dr. Seuss fashion, the rhythm and rhymes make it so much fun.  I read this book to my niece this weekend, and I wasn't ready for it to end.  The words are all easy enough that a beginning reader should have no trouble with them, if they don't already have the book memorized.\n\nAnd Dr. Seuss's fun illustrations certainly help.  They are stylized as always, but they work to convey the story.\n\nThis is definitely a classic from the pen of Dr. Seuss.  It belongs in every kid's collection.","summary":"Try It.

The protagonist dreams of a better place, where he doesn't get attacked, and on his journey to the mystical place where there are few problems, he runs into more and more problems, some of them being violent, others of abandonment and betrayal and the pictures going with these scenes are scary for children. The ending of the book is not the fulfillment of the dream, but the return to the beginning, to the problems he knows. Maybe from an adult perspective it makes sense to tackle the problems at hand rather than to dream of escape, but children need the mystical place and a happy ending, which this book certainly doesn't have. The last picture is one of violence.\nI usually like Dr. Seuss books, but this book got ruined by the message.","summary":"not a book for children","unixReviewTime":1326844800,"vote":7.0,"image":null}

This is one of the books that you as an adult, will memorize--because they'll ask you to read it again, and again, and again.\n\nAs an educator and parent, I can attest to the value of using these books for lessons with phonics.  Once they learn the pattern (consonant-vowel-consonant), they form their own words.  For example:  'can' is the basis for 'man'; 'pan'; 'fan', etc.  This is education at its best; enjoyable and fun for both you and your child.\n\nThe hardback, shiny cover is both durable and eye-catching.  The pages are of sufficient weight paper that they will not tear easily.  Little hands will be able to hold it, as it is lightweight.

The Hebrew works unbelievably well; somebody put a great deal of thought into it.  The rhymes rarely feel \"forced,\" and are often quite clever and funny.\n\nThe second thing that struck me, only after a couple of readings, is that despite the English title, the Hebrew version does not mention what is on the plate AT ALL.  This is probably a strategic move, as many Hebrew-speaking children either wouldn't know what ham was or would be disgusted by it (and not just by its greenness!).\n\nThe Hebrew title translates literally to, \"I'm not hungry and I don't like it.\"  What \"it\" is remains a mystery.  Luckily, there is still the happy ending to look forward to, when \"Sheiv,\" the beleaguered central character (Sam, in English), gets to taste the greenish substance and acknowledge that, hey, he may have been a little hungry after all.\n\nIn any language, with a translation this good, this is a fun book to read, and I'd highly recommend this to English-speaking families, like ours, who are trying to build up a library of Hebrew translations of familiar stories.","summary":"NOT \"Green Eggs and Ham\" in Hebrew!","unixReviewTime":1272153600,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

Sherwin","reviewText":"The children's book entitled Green Eggs and Ham by Dr. Seuss does a great job of teaching young kids to try new things while increasing their vocabulary. The illustrations are very nicely done with hybrid \"things\" replacing people. These \"things\" are part human and part \"thing\"--great concept to stimulate a child's imagination! The text is written in easy to understand words so that with a little help your child be able to read this book independently soon.\n\nThe book tells a cute story of how a smaller \"thing\" or, \"person named Sam\" follows a \"grown up thing\" or, \"person who is not Sam\" around, beseeching them to try some food they've never eaten before, namely green eggs and ham. Happily, the food turns out to be delicious in the end. While the basic moral of the story is not to be afraid of trying new things; the child learns a lot of vocabulary and comparisons at the same time. Great!\n\nSpecifically, children learn the concepts of \"here,\" \"there\" and \"anywhere;\" \"like\" versus \"do not like;\" and modes of transportation including \"car\" and \"train.\" Excellent!\n\nThe book is nicely bound and the strength of the hardcover binding makes the book tolerate the bending and occasional carelessness of a young child who is learning to read partly by using this book. Great!\n\nI highly recommend Green Eggs and Ham for younger kids who are just learning to read. This book will increase their vocabulary by introducing words, comparisons and pictures. The child gets encouragement to try new things; and the adorable illustrations will delight children everywhere.\n\nGreat job, Dr. Seuss!","summary":"Green eggs and ham ???

Woodley","reviewText":"I would definitely recommend you buy this book, it is amazing. It has the most whimsically wonderful illustrations, wonderfully catchy text and rhymes and overall a great message for kids.\n\nThe story has a nameless hero who narrates the action, he trips over, then gets bitten, and while trying to watch in front and behind gets attacked from above and below. He meets a man going to Solla Sollew (where they never have troubles at least very few). So he joins him on the trip - but things go very wrong indeed and when he finally gets there they have had a trouble and so the gate keeper is going to another town (where they never have any troubles at all).\n\nI think this (like Horton the elephant) has a sophisticated underlayer of humour which appeals to adults and children alike, The one wheeled wubble driver who blithely sits back and lets our poor narrater drag him and and the camel along because it is much more efficient for someone to pick the best path and have all the pain and the aches. The general who bravely pushes every one in to battle, and then instantly calls retreat, the door man to Solla Sollew who just walks away. They are all instantly recognisable in every day life as well as in caricature in this book.\n\nThe illustrations are so whimsically lovely - the best is the billowy marshmallow pillows, but there are lovely flower like plants on the banks of the beautiful river Wah-hoo - which my children adore.\n\nI would recommend this book above many of the other classic Seuss works - it is a wonderful, funny, story and a nice message in it to instil in your children.

It is a disturbing glimpse at the Cold War forces that made Eisenhower-era America the stifling society it was, a nightmare for the creative and intellectual classes.\nIt begins with an Everyman innocently reading in, we should presume, his own home.  A stranger runs past him with a wooden sign announcing that he is Sam.  Our protagonist recognizes he is the victim of a home invasion, but like so many restrained Updike males, is unable to voice his objection to his domestic tranquility being shattered, other than to utter a powerless plea that he doesn't care for this Sam character.\nSam, having taken the upper hand, moves beyond in-your-face picketing (note the clever denegration of peace activists by this introduction) and will now force our hero to eat some offensive looking victuals: meat clearly in the advanced stages of rot, and eggs to match.  There is a suggestion that the spineless victim brought this upon himself by hiding from society, engaging in anti-American activity by reading books.  The reader is left to ponder whether the victim is a Communist, or at the very least a vegetarian.  For this reason, Sam, cleverly named to represent the consensus view of these United States, must prevail.\nThe victim's protests are many, his attempts at evasion numerous.  Leaving the safety of his home only increases his discomfort; he is forced to endure the company of several possibly rabid mammals, all while Sam keeps shoving the unwanted offal in his face.  While he has removed the irrepressible Sam from his house, he must also deal with roller-coaster rides into the water, while getting rained on and being forced to climb a tree; none of these being interests of your typical egghead.  As the story moves along, the reader feels less and less sympathy for the victim, blaming his situation on his noncomformity, even if the society of those who wish him to eat rotten animal products are animals themselves.\nThe presumptive lesson of this book is that one must conform to social pressure, or even worse things will happen.  This fable is an important lesson for today, with so many anti-intellectual messages coming from both government and media.  Viewed in its proper context, we see it as a cautionary tale of a hellishly restrictive society that is back with a vengeance.","summary":"Resistance is Futile...

The format of a quest was as appealing to me as a youngster as it is to all of us in its many more mature formats. Like all Seuss books, it is a little wierd and twisted - I am not always sure that is a good thing, but I loved the alliteration of phrases like \"the perilous poozers of pomplemoose pass\".  As many have noted, the plot of a character facing his troubles in stead of searching for greener pastures was clearly evident to me as a 4 year old.

Sam-I-Am presents the meal in several different ways (in a box, with a fox, on a train, in the rain) but his cantankerous friend still refuses to eat the peculiar dish.  In the end, Sam-I-Am's determination pays off, prompting his pal to take a bite.

Discouraged by these setbacks, he is all ears when a chap on a One-Wheeler Wubble comes along and says that there's never any trouble in the City of Solla Sollew, and offers take him there.  The trip turns out to be very arduous and difficult.  Finally at Solla Sollew, a new problem arises.  From this experience, he decides to be more proactive in the future.  \"Now my troubles are going, To have trouble with me!\"\nLike all of the Dr. Seuss books, this one is enlivened by hilarious creatures, dramatic and colorful illustrations, and a pleasant rhyming scheme that uses funny names to aid the rhymes.\nOne of the most difficult lessons for people to learn is that we carry the seeds of all our problems and opportunities around with us.  Simply changing the scenery may not be enough, if our old ways of thinking still guide us.  If you are somewhat depressed and see no opportunity in one place, even in an earthly paradise you can still experience life the same way.\nMany people go through life looking for the perfect mate, house, and job, only to be constantly disappointed.  In I Had Trouble in Getting to Solla Sollew, that voyage toward perfection can be quickly experienced and the lesson learned.  Here is where a parent can make a big difference.  You need to share some experiences in your own life where you lived this story, and share what you learned as a result.  In this way, you can help you child in later years by providing an alternative perspective and reminding her or him or this story.  \"Are you going to Solla Sollew?\" can be a shorthand way of encouraging your child to re-examine the purpose of  the sought-for change.\nFor an adult, the benefit from this story can be to help you consider whether all of the error-elimination you pursue is worth the effort.  My clients frequently are interested in reducing their error rate.  They may be starting, though, in an area with an error rate that is only one in ten million occurrences.  And the area being considered may be relatively unimportant to the success of the organization.  The same effort could instead make important improvements in some area where mistakes abound, results do matter, and perfection is an impossible dream.\nDecide what the problem is before you grab just any solution!","summary":"The Grass Only Seems To Be Greener Elsewhere","unixReviewTime":982627200,"vote":23.0,"image":null}

It is a text for any adult in life too.  If you consider it 'Sam I Am' was the ultimate salesperson fo  all time.  I have handed this book to new sales trainees wanting to know  'how to sell' as it gets across the simple example of 'persistence pays  off'.  It sheds light in the manner that salespeople are really the people  whose task it is to introduce new things into the society, and it is upon  their efforts and results that measure the new technology or products  ultimate success.  No new technology goes anywhere without someone along  the line selling it to someone.  I have long since felt that this simple  tale by Dr. Suess conveyed that lesson with this story about 'Sam I  Am'.\nAdditionally this book carries with it a message about really  looking and observing for yourself, and not just allowing your observations  about life to be confined into a snap answer to everything along the lines  of 'It's new or different, I don't like it and won't condsider it.'  Or  'It's not socially acceptable, I couldn't possibly...'  The resistent man  in this tale finally is made to really see things for himself, and  disregard his previous fixed opinions about things.  Ultimately he is  enlightened upon the glories of Sam's offering of Green Eggs and Ham, and  he finds upon actually trying them that he likes them.  This is a timeless  story that holds an incredible message about observation and on the flip  side, persistence.\nLook at it this way: had Sam not persisted with his  sales efforts, the man would have been denied the happiness he ultimately  found in trying Green Eggs and Ham.  Also if the man never looked and  finally tried it for himself, he would have missed out on some happiness he  did not know existed, because he was forbidding himself to actually look  and experience it himself and knocking aside all social considerations that  would retrain him.\nI consider this to be more than just a story spun by  Dr. Suess for entertainment of children, but more exactly a lesson about  life to be understood at all levels of society.  A elegant masterpiece if  wisdom.","summary":"A Magical Message About Observation & Persistence!","unixReviewTime":967248000,"vote":null,"image":null}

The plot is more complete and complex than any other Seuss, and  the moral is as valuable today as when I first read it.

The Spanish Steps will become a sea of azaleas and the various stational churches and basilicas will get themselves all decked out in finery and flowers for their special feast days (e.g. San Lorenzo in Lucina awash in roses and orchids on Friday of the 3rd week in Lent). If you are fortunate enough to be planning a trip to Roma by all means avail yourself of \"The Companion Guide to Rome\" by Georgina Masson.  It's in several editions but I prefer the earlier ones without the updates by Mr. Fort.  My current favorite is a 1966 edition.  This book is in a class all it's own in the mass of publications about the city of Rome. It is probably not a book to drag around all day as you tramp the streets of the Eternal City but then why not (it doesn't weigh much more than a water bottle).  But it is certainly a book to have in your hotel room to read about the neighborhood you are about to visit or the one you visited the day before.  Ms Masson gives lots of details about museums, churches and architecture but it is as much poetic-literature as it is a guide book, she is one with her city (she lived there for many years) and wants us to feel that along with her.  For me she succeeds admirably! Earlier this year when I was longing to be in Rome but couldn't be I picked up the Companion Guide then read each chapter with great care and observation as Ms Masson walked me through the tangled streets and lively piazzas, in and out of churches and museums and to favorite little escapes, unknown to most people, but waiting to be discovered guided by the adventerous, creative spirit of Georgina.

Unfortunately, after a week in Rome we decided this book was fairly worthless. If it provided deep history on the sites we saw (so we could review what we had seen in the evenings), I'd be thrilled. Unfortunately, the book comes with maps printed so small it's hard to read them even after you've seen the things they portray in person. And the guide has only a tiny amount of history and background on things... mostly it provides inane comments like \"to the left of XYZ, you'll see ABC\" which a guide like the Eyewitness Guide does more clearly with pictures. (Not to mention its descriptions say things like \"from the entrance you can see...\" without acknowledging that there are 6 separate entrances to the site or clarifying which one it's referring to.) It also provides distinctly un-insightful history saying things like \"[name] was the person who gave real meaning to the abbreviation S.P.Q.R\" but without actually telling you what SPQR stands for or how the person gave it meaning. Perhaps the book is a decent refresher for people who already know Rome's history, but don't expect any insight into things you don't already know. And it's definitely not a guide to carry with you--the maps are tiny and illegible with 3-point type, and the information too dense to find things quickly--it's laid out and reads like a 400 page novel.","summary":"dense and unhelpful for first-time tourists","unixReviewTime":1079222400,"vote":null,"image":null}

This was one of my favorite books as a kid and it's value has held up over time. Now, as an adult, I read this book on a whole different level than I did when I was 7.\n\nAs a kid, and I get the impression this is how my kids views it too, the point is pretty straightforward. Basically that it's stupid to get all ruffled up and start a fight over something so trivial as the way a group of people butter their bread. (Though those butter side down freaks are just weird.) That's a great conversation starter for a child.\n\nAs an adult, I realize the world is a lot more complex than this. This book doesn't make a case for total disarmament or anything like that. It's not suggesting that a defensive military is a bad thing. What it does do is illustrate the underlying issue behind most of the world's petty disputes, that our differences aren't what draw us towards war so much as our distrust and lack of understand of the people who are different from us. If the Yooks and Zooks and just taken their buttered up bread and buttered down bread and talked about it with each other they would have found they each held half of the components of a nice butter sandwich. Instead they assumed that the other side acted differently because they were sinister and evil. That makes the escalation of violence easier, when you go into it thinking you are morally superior to your opponent.\n\nAnd think about how many times humanity has gone to war over two group disagreeing on the way each interprets the same book. When you think about that, fighting over the correct side of the bread to butter doesn't seem like it's that far removed from reality.\n\nOf course my kid isn't picking up any of this. But the book is laying the groundwork for it. And now I, some 30 years after I last put this book down, am appreciating it on an entirely new level.\n\nAs for the illustrations, they are standard Seussian. In other words they look similar to every other Dr Seuss book. The color theme is orange, yellow, and blue, just like the cover. It's visually appealing.","summary":"Holds up over time.","unixReviewTime":1461542400,"vote":null,"image":null}

He would do accents and speak in a comforting rhythm that never failed to lull me to sleep. Its one of my earliest memories of reading. And one of my fondest.\n\nI knew once I found out I was going to be a mother that I would get to pass on that love of Dr. Seuss to my daughter.  Im confident it will turn into a tradition because my daughter loves to read Dr. Seuss to me; I can only imagine when she has a family of her own to read too.  It kinda makes you feel small when you think about it that way.  Something that you did will continue to live on after you expire.\n\nBut enough with the history lesson, the reason Im telling you this is because this book is on my Read Harder challenge list from Book Riot.  Read a book out loud to someone.\n\nThis book should be mandatory reading IMO because it touches upon a subject that is very difficult for some people to deal with; the judgment of others. Many types of judgment can be seen in our soci0-economic structure; in our past as well as our present.  Just because some people don't talk the same way, look the same way, act the same way, or do the same things that you do; like say, eating bread and butter a certain way, doesnt mean you are better than them. Or that they should be treated differently for it.\n\nThis book explains to children a complex concept in a simple way that can be easily understood.  Dr. Seuss was a brilliant writer\/poet and his books will continue to remain in mainstream literature because of his catchy rhymes and awkward illustrations that show kids a more adult view of the world.  A view that they can identify with and understand.\n\nIts my favorite Dr. Seuss book of all time. And thats saying a lot since he had so many great books.  Highly recommended to people of all ages.

DelParto","reviewText":"Dr. Seuss takes one of the most historic eras of the twentieth century and transforms it into one of life's lessons that may appeal to young and old.  The Butter Battle Book was first published in 1984 during the latter part of the Cold War of the mid 1980s.  The story involves two communities, the Yooks and the Zooks, and what can they possibly be in conflict with?  The right and wrong of spreading butter on a piece of bread, the Yooks argue that butter should be spread on top of the bread while the Zooks believe it should be spread on the bottom side of the bread.  What arises after each cannot come to a consensus?\n\nThe entire premise of the story involves building new inventive concoctions to deter the opposing group.  As all of this is going on within each side, the Yooks and the Zooks simply cannot see an end to the conflict.  Instead, they continue to build and build bigger walls and massive machinery with the attempt that one will give up.  However, neither side gives in.  And as one reads the story, one of the resolutions that neither side even attempted, a peaceful means of negotiation through communication and speaking with each side rather than producing more unnecessary inventions that simply have not worked.  So where does the story end?  Where it began.\n\nThe Butter Battle Book is one of Dr. Seuss's classic stories that falls within the same vein as other controversial storylines that speaks to the masses and offers a lesson, The Lorax.  This story also leaves much room for further discussion almost twenty years after it was written as well as within the present day.","summary":"A story that leaves a thought provoking ending","unixReviewTime":1373587200,"vote":7.0,"image":null}

Children need to be able to conceptualize what war technically is, and they are not going to get that in a culture mired within the ludicrous fantasy that the military \"protects our freedoms\" and therefore should recline in the blissful cupidity of casual acceptance without criticism.  These people would actually make excellent Soviet citizens, even though they manage to assume otherwise.\n\nWhen you hear war-mongering pigs decry this book as an audacious, even \"radical\" attempt to indocrinate young people with a simplified explaination to what they imagine is a \"complex\" issue you will often hear testimonials from military families.  How is a military family made?  Through indocrination.\n\nSo the criticism tends to fall flat on it's face.  Especially when adjusted to scale; a casual flip through the Butter Battle Book at the school library is not the same thing as having your parents and their parents unfurling a gilded dynasty of military \"service\" in your face every single day.  Frankly I think that Seuss could have made a few more like this one. A book focusing on the fact that the military not only doesn't protect our freedoms (civil dissidence does), but that it also imperils the citizenry by making trouble for the sake of purpose.  Which is exactly what happens.\n\nWhen people complain that this book mirrors the Cold war you hear them talking in vague, abstract platitudes.  They pretty much substitute the noun \"United States\" with a rainbow of positive adjectives and then bury the noun \"Soviet Union\" in a flury of negative ones.  As mentioned before these are indocrinated citizens, their counterparts in the cold war would be the state loyalists who denounced the west and kept portraits of Stalin over their mantlepieces.\n\nLong live the anti war movement.  Perhaps the longest, most sustained, and certainly most popular battle for our freedoms we have ever seen in this country's history.  Whenever \"the nation\" goes to war we are seeing an assault on our freedoms on behalf of the government, who typically have to lie or dishonestly frame an issue just to procure consent. By 'Nation' I mean narrow, often private interests and their goofy, militarized cultists who monopolize the debate with abstractions.","summary":"A kick in the teeth for war-mongerers.","unixReviewTime":1303948800,"vote":null,"image":null}

I think my parents bought it when my mom was still pregnant with me.\nBoth of my parents were military.  My mother was a Russian Linguist during the cold war and my father was part of the MI comunity so I think this book hit them as perfect!  My sister and I were raised on Dr. Seuss but The Butter Battle Book and The Lorax were always my favorits.\nI now have two kids of myown and I read at least two Dr. Seuss stories to them every night before bed.  Dr. Seuss still has a way of teaching children moral and common scence leasons in a way that your child doesnt know that they are learning.\nMy daughter is 5 and her favorit is Yertle The Turtle, and my son, who's 2, requires me to read The Sneetches every night... and at nap time if he can get away with it.\nI would recommend Dr. Seuss to anyone... not just parents or grandparents.  I think my dad still reads them without kids anywhere near him, and he's in his 50s.  The leasons in these books aren't just for kids.\nNote: If your kids don't like to go to bed, read Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book to them.  My kids have yet to stay awake through it, and it works the imagination, so their dreams and imaginations are strong!

I believe Dr. Seuss was a genius, and my political leanings are in line with his.  The only explanation I can come up with for this book is that it wasn't intended for children or non-violent adults, but rather to send to war mongers to show them the error of their ways.  My five and seven year old daughters found it downright disturbing.  I \"accidentally\" skipped over much of it when I saw the look of sadness, concern, and utter confusion on their faces.  It details a war between two nations, and the somewhat silly names for the weaponry are not nearly enough to make the increasingly morbid arms race palatable.\n\nThere are just so many better Dr. Seuss books: for big kids and adults, try \"Did I Ever Tell You How Lucky You Are\", \"Oh, the Places You Will Go\", or \"Happy Birthday to You\"; for little kids, read \"One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish\", \"Go Dog, Go!\", and \"Dr. Seuss's ABC\".  These are a much better representation of this man's talent, and just a tiny taste of the incredible treasures he left for the world to enjoy.\n\nP.S. ANYTHING adapted by Tish Rabe for Dr. Seuss is excellent as well, and great for intelligent elementary-aged kids.","summary":"I Love Dr. Seuss, not The Butter Battle Book","unixReviewTime":1235520000,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

The book is essentially an allegory of the cold war.  With two different ideologies battling it out in secret rooms with weapons that are never used.\n\nLike the Lorax, this book is great for children and adults alike, because it discusses such an important subject in such an accessible and colorful way. Adults will see the parallel between the book and the conflict of the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. and children will see an allegory for themes such as racism , and other thoughtless ignorances.\n\nThis is a powerful book, and in my belief an essential part of anyone's libary.  If you are the mother or father of a young child, my reccomendation goes much deeper.  Use this book as a way to start a discussion on any conflict that doesn't make sense to the child.

It presents, in kid-friendly idiom, the inane causes of war. Although presented as silliness, the conflict rapidly escalates through successively goofier armaments. The end shows the entire populace descending into underground shelters with the Big-Boy Boomeroo about to be launched by both sides at once.\n\nThe presentation is Seussish and silly, a real contrast to his hawkish WWII editorial cartoons. Still, it's grimly familiar to anyone who lived in the 1950s and 60s. Bomb shelters and the threat of mutually assured destruction were daily realities then, and their memory is still sharp. Maybe, if kids see insanity early enough, they'll learn to avoid it.

Marren","reviewText":"\"Butter Battle\" tells the story of the Yooks and Zooks, two identical races living on two sides of a high wall, differing only in how they butter their bread. The book is about passing on prejudice and hatred to children, when grandfather reveals the terrible bread-buttering practices of those who live on the other side. It's about hair-trigger readiness for war, and the arms race. All this, with Seuss' rhyming prose and vivid, funny illustrations.\n\n\"Butter Battle\" was a departure for Dr. Seuss, a serious book about the nature of war and the nuclear arms race. Perhaps he wrote it with the Cold War in mind, and some object that the book trivializes the nature of that conflict. But our history since 1984 provides too many examples of what Seuss was talking about--the Balkan conflicts, India-Pakistan, the Middle East. The book isn't widely available (except on Amazon!) but it's certainly worth tracking down. I used it in an \"English as a Second Language\" class on discrimination and prejudice.

The book also, however, can be viewed as showing the necessity of arms races, since, as the book implies, if one side doesn't match the threat of the other, than the other will strike.  The only problem I see with it though, is that the entire book, especially the ending, might be a bit too much for younger kids, which is what Dr. Seuss's audiance has become.  Sadly older children (10 to 12) would probably much rather read something that seems more mature, since by this age they're perfectly capable of reading chapter books.\n\nA surprisingly well writen political commentary by a children's author, The Butter Battle Book can easily be viewed as a Seuss classic.","summary":"Seuss's darkest and most political work","unixReviewTime":1103500800,"vote":12.0,"image":null}

Garrard","reviewText":"Unlike any of his other books, Dr. Suess's \"The Butter Battle Book\" is as close to an anti-war book as any children's text could be.  It tells of two warring countries divided by a great wall.  The similarity between the East and the West of pre-fall of the Berlin Wall is evident to the plot.\nThe Zooks on one side of the wall eat their bread with the butter side down; the Yooks on the side eat their bread with the butter side up.  This is the reason for the conflict.  Each side feels that theirs is the correct manner for eating bread.  Becoming suspicious of each other, they construct this wall and devise military means to defend themselves from any attack from the other side.  Humorously, the author portrays military strategists as obsessive little men that endlessly work in backrooms creating greater weapons of destruction.\nThe story ends with the two opposing generals facing each other with the ultimate bomb that will destroy the enemy's land.  The grandson of one general asks the question, \"Who's going to drop it?\"  The reply is, \"Be patient...we will see.\"\nA powerful statement is this for it raises questions about our own relationship in the World Order.  Dr. Suess, known for his whimsical excursion into fantasy and lyrical rhyme, has not abandoned these elements.  He has just expanded his horizons by writing a children's book for adults.  This work should be required reading for military and government leaders worldwide!\nThe theme of acceptance of differences is the key to this story.

Howe","reviewText":"I remember hearing about this book some years ago, but it was only recently that I began to think of it again.  When the images coming out of the middle east and Israel began circulating, and it seemed that retaliation by both sides kept building and building to the point of human nonsense, this book came to mind.\nThe story contains the Zooks and the Yooks.  They are both similar in their looks, but it is by the means which they butter their bread, that they are at odds with each other.  Zooks butter their bread upside down, while yooks right-side up.  It is this dispute that causes them to not get along, as an older Zook tells his grandson.  Then one day, Grandpa patrols the wall, when his guard device, a \"Snickberry Switch,\" is destroyed by a Yook named Van Itch.  It is this that leads to the chain reaction of arms and almost total foolishness, as the Zooks and the Yooks begin building larger and stranger devices to keep the other at bay.  finally, it all comes down to the \"Bitty Big Boy Boomeroo.\"  A tiny device about the size of a gumball.  It causes both Yooks and Zooks to take cover, but the Grandfather Zook and Van Itch stand at the wall, waiting to see who will drop their first.  In a children's story, this is quite a world view.  Much as the Lorax was on the fact of nature and the care it must have to be maintained, this book delves greatly into the human psyche.  Why is it that becuase of subtle differences, we, ashuman beings, cannot look past these and accept the others.  Mainly, I read this book thinking of the Arab and Plaestinian conflict in thet middle east.  If a child needed a book to read to show them the follies to avoid in their adult life, I'd recommend this one for sure.","summary":"A cautionary story that many adults should read!","unixReviewTime":982800000,"vote":10.0,"image":null}

Then things go wrong because \"a very rude Zook by the name of VanItch snuck up and slingshotted my Snick-Berry switch!\"  The border guard for the Yooks tells his superior.  The scientists get to work, and soon an improved weapon (a Triple-Sling Jigger) is available.  The Zooks counter again, and so on it goes.  The names, characteristics, and illustrations of the weapons are hilarious.  Then, just when you are enjoying the folly, the scientists come up with the BITSY BIG-BOY BOOMEROO, which fits in the palm of a hand.  Everyone has to get into a shelter underground because it is so dangerous.  \"'Grandpa!' I shouted.  'Be careful  Oh, gee!  Who's going to drop it?  Will you . . . ?  Or will he . . . ? . . . We'll see.  We will see . . . .'\"  To go from that silliness to that horror in such a short number of pages is an amazingly effective job of story telling.\nThe book also explores how such conflicts are caused by lack of communication.  There's a wall between the Yooks and the Zooks.  Over the years, it gets higher and higher.  So they can see a little about each other, but not talk.  From what they see, they are astonished that one side eats their bread and butter with the butter-side up, while the other eats with the butter-side down.  I thought that was a pretty interesting way to capture the kind of small differences that often lead to border wars.  Consider the former Yugoslavian states.\nThe primary drawback of such a story for children is that it is a chilling tale.  Visions of mutual destruction are not exactly what I would want to read to a small child just before bed.  However, it may be appropriate for some children who are very violent in their play and need to be reined in a little.  I would suggest that it be read early in the day, however, even in such a case.  For children who are sensitive and easily frightened, this book should probably be read much later in life than age 8.  If this were a movie, I would suggest at least a PG-13 rating, and possibly an R.\nDefinitely, every adult should read this book.  We still live in a world where these issues are current.  I hope that someday this book will seem quaint and obsolete as a characterization of human beings.  Until it does, the book should be sharing its message broadly.\nAfter you have finished enjoying the book, I suggest that you consider how you can help promote international understanding.  Perhaps you can at least find someone to correspond with by e-mail on the other side of the world.  Better yet, can you lend a helping hand somehow?\nLive long and prosper . . . because of friendly, cooperative competition!","summary":"Futility, Folly, and Fear from an Arms Race","unixReviewTime":979171200,"vote":19.0,"image":null}

As you'd expect from Macaulay, the illustrations are superbly executed in his iconic crosshatched style, and his depictions of city life, and structures being built, are a joy to behold.  We follow the development of the city from a small military camp to a bustling city of 50,000, showing each step in the city's establishment. Macaulay depicts the building of aqueducts, defensive walls, a road system, sewers, government buildings, homes, markets, an amphitheater, and public baths.\n\nAlthough it's beautifully illustrated and raises some relevant points about urban planning, \"City\" falls a little short when compared with some of Macaulay's other works. It's exceptionally well done for a \"kid's book,\" but the writing feels a little simplistic in places, and the artwork isn't quite as stunning as it was in \"Cathedral.\" I recommend \"City\" mostly to the author's fans, or to people interested in ancient Rome, but aren't looking for a stuffy textbook. I'm not sure if kids will totally understand or really appreciate this book, although it does include a handy glossary. It does raise an interesting point - once a Roman city had reached it's maximum size, it's walls were just as much for keeping the city in, as they were for keeping the enemy out!","summary":"Roman urban planning and building construction - for kids!","unixReviewTime":1442016000,"vote":null,"image":null}

I am both a fan of architecture and of Rome so a book like this is incredibly interesting to me.  Understanding now how they built their roads, aqueducts, sewage systems and even sidewalks gives me a whole new appreciation for the Roman sense of planning, order and preparation.  Each page of this book highlights one area of the construction of a pretend city called Verbonia from the planning and site prep to its completion 20 years later.  Each page will typically have a short paragraph about a step in the cities construction and then some beautifully drawn details.  Though I read through the book in about an hour one could easily spend twice as lone going through the drawings in detail.  Due to this City would also serve as an awesome reference book just to have in one's library.\n\nI can easily recommend this book to just about anybody as its appeal will be broad.  The fact that me and my six year old both jumped on it when my wife brought it home attests to this.\n\nI got the chance to flip through this author's book on Pyramids and it is just as good.\n\nHighly Recommended","summary":"This book is awesome","unixReviewTime":1348876800,"vote":null,"image":null}

The books is concise and filled with illustrations to aid the reader in imagining what a Grand scheme a Roman Engineered city must have been (especially considering what setbacks in civilization would come later through the middle ages).\n\nI really enjoyed this book, the only setback I have with it is that it is maybe too good at summarizing it's subject.  It is a brief read, more belonging to the non-fiction section of a 'Young Adults' library than a history loving 'Adult'. It is a little...sanitized in Roman Rule, and skirts around the visciousness of Italy.  One would be inclined to believe the Romans were peaceful while reading this, and forget that they were a civilization bent on subjugaition of foreign lands, and brutal in justice for all citizens.  That is the only reason I hold back 1 star; there is much more that could be told, and considering the excellent detail the rest of the book gives, it could have abbreviated LESS in it's timeline, and the reader would have been much more in debt to the author for having done so.

I was fascinated to learn how they built the aqueducts for the city's water supply, even going through hills, and the sewer system underground to keep the city sanitary.  The architecture of the forum and baths was so intriguing.  Of course, this might be expected from the author of \"The Way Things Work\"!  His detailed drawings are fabulous.

Tunis and Sloane blended well written history with well done pen and pencil illustrations.  \"City\" follows the standard convention of beginning with a parcel of undeveloped land and showing the building process as the project progresses to a completed Roman city.\n\nWhat makes this book so important is that David Macauley was able to expand the age paremeters and produce a beautiful book that could appeal to both young children and adults. His skills as a story teller and illustrator allowed people to look architecture and history in a new light.  There are other illustrators with stronger drafting skills but there is nobody with more imagination.  Macaulay is not afraid to enter into an image and tear it apart and look at it from many different viewpoints.  There is a sense of movement and playfulness in his illustrations that make him unique.\n\nThis book is so important in the history of children's non-fiction literature because David Macaulay opened the doors for a whole series of children's book illustrators who have produced hundreds of illustrated history books.","summary":"A Ground Breaking Book","unixReviewTime":1167091200,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

The basic premise is simple enough: these people from another time and country are going to build something, and the book is going to show us how they did it. The text itself, as with many children's books, is relatively simple, but the intricate pen-and-ink drawings are spellbinding. Time and again I would go back to CITY, and pore over the pictures, often discovering some previously-overlooked detail that Macaulay had included.\n\nI highly recommend CITY, and Macaulay's other architectural books, to both children and adults. Most children are inherently curious, and interested in how things are made, why they work, and who made them. Macaulay teaches those things in his books, but more importantly, the books draw the reader in and stimulate the imagination. There's a hands-on history lesson inherent in each of these books, a brief glimpse at other cultures around the globe and in different times. Whether it's ancient Egypt, classical Rome, medieval France, or 18th Century America, the worlds in Macaulay's books are always fascinating to visit.","summary":"A marvelous book","unixReviewTime":1102204800,"vote":47.0,"image":null}

Both protagonists (Lion and Blue the Brazilian Butterfly) find themselves in love, yet must first take their own individual paths to get to a point at which they can be together.  It is implied that both need to grow, explore, learn on their own first in order to be the very best for each other.

Or at least it was in my day, when I was in college in the 70's. But I never read it back then, which is just as well, as I was probably not ready for it.\n\nI just finished it this evening. It is a long and very detailed book. Though I thought it very interesting, I don't think most readers would want to tackle such a lengthy book unless they are very interested in Hemingway.\n\nThe image of Hemingway that emerges in this book is contradictory and disturbing. At times I found myself loving him, at other times I hated him. Those may sound like extreme or emotional reactions, but I think them appropriate responses to the portrait drawn in this book. The Hemingway found in these pages inspires me to want to live more deeply and to work more passionately. He loved life and experienced the Caribbean, the American West, Paris, Italy, Spain and Africa with passion and endless reserves of energy. He could also turn on his best friends for no reason, desert his wives, and he killed animals in vast numbers and seemingly without respect for their beauty or elegance. Yet he could describe animals, and nature, with obvious love and deep feeling.\n\nHis most profound and most obvious failing was his love of alcohol. He was a first class drunk, and when drunk, he frequently behaved abominably. He lied, he bullied, he chased women in front of his wives.\n\nHe also wrote books. He did not write a lot of books, and not all of them were good. But his best books were extraordinary. And despite his debilitating alcoholism, not all his great books were the work of his youth. He wrote the best of the short stories, The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms while young. He wrote For Whom the Bell Tolls in his late thirties or early forties and The Old Man and the Sea in his fifties. All of these books are more or less permanent parts of the American canon and deserve their place.\n\nHow one man could be both so charming and so despicable is a bit of a mystery. It is that mystery that pumps blood into Baker's book and keeps it alive. Baker shows both the good and the bad in Hemingway, but it is up to the reader to try to understand the complex novelist who had such great virtue and so many egregious faults.\n\nIf you look at the world in black and white, and think people are either good or bad, you probably will find this a very disturbing book. If you are used to finding both good and bad in your friends and family, you might find interesting this portrait of a person who could at times be not just good but great, and not just bad, but utterly despicable.","summary":"Not Just Black and White","unixReviewTime":1405728000,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

Its insights and commentary are especially surprising since this book was written less than ten years after Hemingway's death.\n\nThis really should the first Hemingway biography you read and certainly not the last.  It was written when the great man's shadow still hovered the literary scene.  If you want to see how present day and post 60's attitudes toward Hemingway developed, this book will give you  clue. Unlike many of the critical analyses of Hemingway, this book attempts to give you a glimpse into the life that was lived that produced such a great writer  Warts and all yet no ax to grind.  I think that many of those who purport to study him really resent him for his talent.  He is one of those writers who seem to be a model for many aspiring authors.  These learn too late that they think that \" I can write like that\" but can't and therefore become bitter.and revel in their hatred, yes hatred, of the man (whom they never met) and works which they have read only once.\n\nI would caution many readers new to Hemingway to be aware of a surfeit of Hemingway biographies and reminiscences  which were only written by \"pilot fish\" intent to cash in on the Hemingway myth with spurious claims to a familiarity with him.\n\nYes I am biased when it comes to Hemingway but I find that the chapter which concerns Hemingway's suicide and mental illness to have been handled with the utmost tact and civility. As for the man remember that this was written before the publication of \"The Garden Of Eden.\" Now that book would stun Hemingway's denigrators.","summary":"Scholarship Not Lurid Journalism","unixReviewTime":1403136000,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

He was a Byronic character who seemed able to do anything.  Carlos Baker goes beyond \"interesting\" into \"gripping\", which cannot be said for most biographies that strive for completeness.  Anthony Burgess wrote an ironic and often amusing biographical sketch of Hemingway too.  The material is lifted almost entirely from this volume.  It's a long book of more than 900 pages and few of them are dull.  And on top of that it's well written.\n\nBaker's style includes quoted phrases from Hemingway's letters and other document and the phrases are earthy and sometimes as funny as hell.  I open the book at random and glance at pages 365 to 367 and I see \"gloriously drunk,\" \"quite a guy,\" \"awfully dumb,\" \"fresh as hell,\" \"3\/4 blind and quite deaf,\" and \"a nice jerk,\" the kind of remarks you're liable to hear about celebrated friends in The White Horse Tavern, combing the commonplace with the incisive.  What an enormous amount of research this represents, and it's balanced too.  When the hero acts the boor, Baker describes the action simply, without judgment, and lets us conclude what we will.\n\nSome of the events described have been disputed.  The famous encounter between Hemingway and Steinbeck, in which Hemingway broke Steinbeck's ancient blackthorn walking stick over his own head, much to Steinbeck's disgust, has been differently described in an issue of \"Esquire\" from about twenty years ago by an eyewitness.  But that's a very minor point.\n\nI did part of a dissertation on the way Hemingway managed the problems associated with growing old.  (He wasn't so good at it, but it's hard to tell because he suffered from mental illness when he was elderly.)  He was given to a kind of adolescent boy's club boasting about his manliness and rugged individualism.  He needed a dose of what in sociology is called \"role distance,\" the ability to step back from a performance and recognize it for what it is.  In the long run it doesn't seem wise to take too much pride in one's prowess, whether physical, artistic, or both.  Hemingway should have gotten into Buddhism and learned that loving something too intensely is a bad idea because, in the end, you always lose it one way or another.\n\nI have a yellowed old copy of the paperback near my desk and I still pick it up and read a page or two while waiting for my PC to boot up or cleanse itself.  That speaks volumes for this volume.","summary":"Excellent.","unixReviewTime":1345593600,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

I describe it as shades of Titanic (in the air) with a touch of Mysterious Island and Pirates of the Carribean thrown in. In this sequel, Oppel takes us back to the world of graceful hydrium ships and into a search for gold.\n\nAs a Paris Airship Academy cadet, Matt Cruse is serving on a rust bucket freighter when the crew sights a long-vanished phantom ship, the Hyperion. Like the Flying Dutchmen of shiplore; the Hyperion is more rumor than fact. The ship is at an unreachable altitude but Matt's captain is foolishly determined to capture it. As the crew falls victim to the crushing altitude, Matt is able to save their lives by disobeying a direct order from his captain.\n\nBack in Paris after this episode Matt is wondering if he has a future at the Academy or with the lovely Kate de Vries.  Kate wants to prepare an expedition to find the Hyperion though she is more interested in scientific discoveries than the legendary treasure.\n\nMatt alone knows the the ship's last position and others want his knowledge. Should he let the dream of wealth overtake him and join in the hunt for the Hyperion or should he plug away at his studies and forget the whole thing?\n\nLike treasure hunters searching for Spanish galleons at impossible ocean depths, the team will have to break the sky in their quest. A beautiful gypsy girl, a privateer with questionable motives, a prim governess, brilliant Kate and brave but confused Matt make up the party and are in for the flight of their lives.\n\nAs Kate suspects, there are other lethal creatures in the sky besides cloud cats. The other presence in the story is the Captain Nemo\/Howard Hughes-type eccentric who built the Hyperion so many years ago. Is his spirit ready to part with the secrets of the ghost ship?\n\nHoration Hornblower meets Jules Verne -- this is a cracking read. I hope Oppel will visit this world again. His fascination with bats continues by the way.","summary":"A terrific sequel","unixReviewTime":1133395200,"vote":10.0,"image":null}

The sequel had so much to live up to and it disappoints on several levels: there's the odd spelling mistake, some errors in syntax, and those are forgivable; however, the shallow character development and the overall pace and direction of the sub-plots feels hurried, at times issues are just glossed over like Simpkins supposed romance. The novel at times reads like it was half-baked and the publisher rushed it to market before letting Mr. Oppel really flesh out his characters. It's more plot driven than Airborn. That's not to say Airborn has no plot, it's there but the character development is done with such finesse and interwoven with the plot that it succeeds in a way that Skybreaker fails to attain. Skybreaker's characters seem one dimensional in comparison. For example Matt's father is often mentioned in Airborn and is always a haunting reminder of what Matt aspires to; in Skybreaker his father is more of an afterthought and would have made a perfect appearance when Icarus (Matt) falls through the sky (think the scene when Matt is flung off the side of the Aurora and how that was deeply tied to his father). I love the ties to the Sherpas given the ships name, but I felt they were secondary characters that could have played a larger role or at least been given more depth to their raison dtre in this tapestry. As much as I enjoyed the plot, I feel there could have been more to this story. Gone is the feeling I had of Matt in Airborn, a feeling of excitement that only a young D'Artagnan obtaining his promotion can compare: the underdog moving up the ladder and breaking barriers once thought impossible.","summary":"at times issues are just glossed over like Simpkins supposed romance","unixReviewTime":1424908800,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

He has created a fascinating setting: I don't believe the actual year is ever cited, but it feels like the early twentieth century in an alternate history where the Hindenburg disaster never soured the general public on lighter-than-air craft and a substance called hydrium makes immense airships feasible.  Against this backdrop, he tells a cracking adventure reminiscent of the best pulp adventures, with involving characters and a romance that doesn't feel cloying and juvenile.

But calling this series steampunk is doing it a disservice, while Oppel does borrow from modern steampunk, what starts to become apparent to me, with this the second book in series, is that what he has actually done is simply continue the \"golden\" era of pulps into the thirties and forties as if the first and second world wars had never happened. In a word, it is \"Brilliant\".\n\nAll three of these books read like any number of Edgar Rice Burrows tales and each one seems to me to fit a specific subgenre in early pulps, in book two, which is the one I qualify as the most \"Action\/Adventure \"of the trilogy, Matt joins an expedition to the unheard of altitude of 30,000 feet to recover a lost luxury liner where he finds a cold airless wasteland and fantastical creatures of the unexplored heights! This series is just plain old fashion fun and I highly recommend it to everyone but most especially to anyone who grew up reading pulps or wants a glimpse back to what people imagined in a time when a great deal of our own planet was still one full of mysteries galore.","summary":"Need a good pulp?","unixReviewTime":1340236800,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

The premise is very straightforward: find the treasure. The obstacles are fairly obvious if you've read the first ten pages of this book and the last Matt Cruse installment. I know these sound like bad things, but they're not. Oppel takes a classic story, but because he is a master at weaving in details, the twists continue to be unexpected, but not surprising. I know, I know-- Savs, you're making no sense. Well, cut me a little slack-- the first week back at law school is killing me.\nWhen I was a little theater student at USC, I had the wonderful opportunity to study for a semester under Gates McFadden (also known to Trekkies as Dr. Beverly Crusher). And she repeatedly told us that our choices as actors should be unexpected, but not surprising. This means no going back against cannon. No \"it was all just a dream\" (unless you do it very, very well, which few people do). No. If a gun is on the table in act one, the audience had better at least think it's going to go off in act three. Oppel has that down to an art. Just as in Airborn, by the end of the story all of the disparate details and elements come together for one roller-coaster climax. I approve.\nSide note about Kate: I was ok with Kate in the first book. And then Nadira, the \"mysterious gypsy\" showed up in this book. I like her a lot better. She's nicer to Matt, she's brave, she isn't as whiny and childish... but of course Matt is in love with the pretty, rich, mean girl. I hope Oppel has fleshed out the love triangle between the three of these characters in the third book. But that's mostly just because I want to know more about Nadira-- we were promised that she was mysterious and that she was hiding something, but I don't think the \"what\" was ever actually stated. Or even alluded to. Sigh.\nRating: 4  stars, rounded up to 5 because of my strong feelings towards the series as a whole\n\nSide note: I wish we could get these in some sort of packaging deal with similar covers. That would be awesome!","summary":"Just as awesome as the first","unixReviewTime":1306195200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Flight academy student Matt and his upper-class sweetheart Kate embark on an air voyage to find the long-missing airship Hyperion so they can salvage treasure and rare animal specimens.  They throw in with Hal Slater, the boastful owner of a \"skybreaker,\" an airship that can fly in very high altitudes, and Nadira, a gypsy girl who has the key that will unlock the booby-trapped doors of the Hyperion.  Of course they are not the only ones who covet the supposed treasure on board the Hyperion.  Their journey is filled with suspense, roller-coaster excitement, heartbreaking lows and joyful highs.\n\nMatt is a rare good guy protagonist who is never boring.  Kate is no less a stellar creation; she's a kind of female Indiana Jones.  Yet neither is perfect and those imperfections are what make them truly memorable.  Their love story is engaging without being cloying.  Hal and Nadira are terrific foils and offer both Matt and Kate a chance to question and examine their true feelings for each other.\n\nBut the main attraction here is a fanciful world full of action and excitement.

I devoured this book is a few hours depsite its rather large size. I was so absorbed and the pages (get ready for a pun) flew by.\n\nThis book continues Matt Cruses saga. When it starts, he is serving as an intern on the airship Flotsam. The Flotsam gets blown off course and as it rises to heights untraveled, it discovers a 40-yr-old mystery: the location of the Hyperion, a ghost ship legended to have riches upon riches on board. Because of some complications, the Flotsam must end it's journey, but that doens't mean the journey ends for Matt Cruse. With the Hyperion's coordinates and thoughts of riches in mind, Matt Cruse along with the heiress Kate de Vries and a mysterious gypsy named Nadira, set out on a perilous journey.\n\nI think this book maybe even better than Airborn. It was filled with the same swashbuckling action and ripping good adventure, and the romance between a certain cabin boy and young heiress grew even tenser. Now there was even a love-quadrangle of sorts with some other new characters thrown it. I think the character development was considerably better this time around, and we finally got some emotion from Mr. Cruse.\n\nThere is just something about these books I adore. They are fun and thrilling, and there is nothing about them that makes me groan in dismay. I think that why these books get five-stars. I'm sure they could be better, but there is nothing about them that I dislike. And the visuals are awesome.

A great deal of this has to do with the protagonist being such a wonderful, upstanding, young man who tries his hardest to do what's right, and questions himself when he falls short (even if his failings were not from his own actions).\n\nOppel has created a new cast of supporting characters for Skybreaker and they are just as detailed and intriguing as the cast of Airborn (first book in the series).  Returning to Skybreaker are certain other favorite characters from the first book, whom I now feel are like my good friends :)\n\nSkybreaker continues a little while after Airborn, (AIROBORN SPOILERS TO FOLLOW)\n\nMatt is now in the Academy and is no longer a crewman aboard the Aurora.  However, when the ship he's temporarily crewing is thrown off course and by chance discovers the Hyperion - a huge ship lost decades ago, with supposedly vast treasure aboard - Matt must decide what, if anything, he's will to risk to retrieve the Hyperion, and it's treasure.\n\nThis is a fast paced adventure full of heart and wonderful characters.  While I felt a few parts towards the beginning were a little slow, the adventure definitely picks up about a third of the way through.  And though I'd probably give Skybreaker four stars compared to Airborn, compared to other books it's worthy of all five stars.\n\nI listened to the Audiobook and am continually impressed with it's production!

If need be, this book could have just been a book, not a sequel. And what a joy that is.\n\n\"Skybreaker\" gives us something different, but still cool. Matt and Kate (heroes from \"Airborn\") have grown a little and things are different.

After an incident of near death (and obeying a captain's foolish orders), Matt finds himself in a dangerous position of knowing the coordinates of the \"Titanic\" of the sky. This ship, \"The Hyperion\", at dangerously high altitudes, is the treasure ship of the sky, thought to be a myth. Everyone wants to be in on the gold that can supposedly be found there.\n\nAnd so begins a new journey. Emotions run high as the altitude grows, and there's plenty of plot to the adventure as well.

The cold and high altitude alone seems to make it impossible. Does he even want to get tangled in another adventure? But whether he does or not, Matt is pulled into a whirlwind of new purpose. Along with him come the admirable Mr. Slater, the mysterious Nadira, Kate and her chaperone, and the crew. All have different reasons why they want to find the ship. But Matt and his friends aren't the only ones after the contents of the Hyperion, and it's a race against time to find it. A world frozen in time, and strange creatures prove that along with untold treasure comes untold danger... in the end, Matt has to decide what's most important.\n\n Kenneth Oppel has written a sequel that soars to incredible heights, being even better than it's predecessor!

He has done a particularly good job of constructing an enjoyable alternative universe which has a Victorian flavor with alternate Victorian type technology, though more advanced in some ways, and an alternate biology as well.  Both the alternate history and biology are particularly well done.  Characterization and plotting is quite well done with the teen romantic elements handled sensibly.  The plot is clever and the conclusion of this book is worthy of the better Spielberg Indiana Jones movies (Oppel was apparently once a scriptwriter).

Well I stand corrected! not only does Skybreaker improve on everything that made Airborne one of my favorite books ever, Its also so well written and perfectly paced that its one of the few books that I actually skipped meals to read.....and Ive read over 1000 books. The story is one of the most original to come out in a long time, Long story short, A slightly older Matt his friend (well more than that) A gypsy Girl named Nadira and an airship pilot named Hal go off to find an Abandoned airship which supposedly contains a fourtunes worth of gold, Much to the chagrin of some pirates who also want the gold (although they are unimportant until the second half of the book)Along the way Matt's simple life is challenged as his greed for money starts to cloud his judgement. Some minor complaints I have about this book are that the character of Nadira gets kind of pushed aside during the second half of the book as Matt starts to fall for Kate. I realize she is not the main character But I would have liked to have seen her do something other than just sit there and be sick. Secondly the book is called Skybreaker,but the skybreaker engines are only mentioned like twice in the whole book....I think a better title would have been Hyperion since basically the whole book revolves around this ship. And finally I thought the book ended at a bad place....it leaves you wondering \"well what the hell happens after!!!\" unless the author is working on another sequel...then just pretend I never typed that complaint\n\nall in all A great book thatcan be enjoyed by both fans of Airborne or just people who love a compelling story.

The Republican Spanish government, supported by Russian communists, socialists, American mercenaries, and other foreigners including Hemingway, was fighting nationalist rebels led by General Francisco Franco, who was backed by German Nazis and Italian fascists.  Stalin saw the war as an opportunity to gain another foothold for Russian communism in western Europe and to divert world attention away from the purges occurring in his own country.  Hitler and Mussolini wanted a Chance to test their new war machine.  Hemingway, although not a communist, believed in the Spanish Republican cause.  The war became a dress rehearsal for World War  II.  .  The story is about a band of Republican guerrillas operating behind fascist lines. Their mission  is to blow up a bridge to slow the fascist advance.  Over the course of a few days the members of the group developed friendships, love relationships,and suspicions of each other.  They accomplish their mission , but at a high price.  The main character is wounded, and at his own request is left behind to try to slow the progress  of the enemy so the others can escape.  This is where the story ends.  I was hoping for a more final ending, but over all I was happy with the book.  I had heard of the Spanish Civil War, but like most people I  knew little of the details of the event.  By reading this story I gained much insight into the causes and effects of the war as well as some understanding of Hemingway's attitude toward communism, socialism, and fascism.  For more information on Hemingway I recommend the book  Writer, \"Writer,Sailor, Soldier, Spy\" by Nicholas Reynolds.  .  David L. Mathews.  .

There must be, for me, some connection with the subject matter, and there must a real interest in understanding what the author is trying to say.  Of course, that begs the problem of each (writer and reader) being able to discuss the book either with the author or another reader.\n\nI liked the book because of the honesty of O'Neill, and I have several qualifications.\n\nFirst, it was interesting because it explains, in detail, what was\/is involved in becoming a Navy Seal; second, the story was told (1st Person) through the eyes (memories and judgment) of one individual (a personal narrative).\n\nQualifications: Robert O'Neill went through several real and important transitions that I related to.  One was his relationships with his fellow Seals and, especially, those who were on his various teams.  These relationships were very strong; they were a transition from a  narrow, personal concern for becoming a Seal to creating a family unit on which military combat relies.  When O'Neill began to change, mature past his Seal experiences, he was finding that many of his Seal brothers were becoming envious of his notoriety  and, therefore, a lack of connection which had been some vital was experienced.\n\nAnother important relationship was with his wife and children.  This was mentioned in very minimal terms which is somewhat understandable because of the lack of time spent with them.  As his story developed, they became more significant, but it left me wondering about his wife's perception and feelings.  I thought that this deserved more attention because of its importance.\n\nThe last chapter (23) is quite an ending, and yet it is a beginning for O'Neill.  His view of his life and that The Seal Bubble as over is important.  That statement explains his view of the changes he experienced, of transition from one life-stage to another.  Life-stages are often age\/maturity related in combination with changes in activity.  It is a growth and adaptive process which can be difficult.  He recognizes that he is in transition and that he believes his Seal experiences and his processing of those experiences has prepared him for a new stage.  This chapter should be a new book.\n\nI recommend this book!","summary":"THE OPERATOR What makes a good book? A good story","unixReviewTime":1504483200,"vote":null,"image":null}

I concur with it completely. But let me add a few notes.\n\n1.  Until I read this book, I hadn't known that Hemingway could also write a warm, moving and haunting love story between a young man and young woman, but this story, about 4 days of love between Maria and Robert, the novel's protagonist, is magnificent.\n2. From an action perspective, this is the story about a single escapade (the blowing up of a bridge near Segovia) within the Spanish Civl War (1936-1939), but it also includes other fascinating forays, such as a wonderful story abut a bull fighter and bull fighting, stories about Russian leaders in the guerrilla war, and stories about Robert Jordan's times in Madrid before and during the war.\n3. The beautiful  love story between Maria and Robert  is, without question, the emotional centerpiece of the book...About this, I can only say, 'Bravo!'.  Enjoy..\n4.

Jordan is a dynamiter who has been assigned to blow a bridge to prevent Fascist reinforcements being sent to repel an Republican attack in teh Spanish Civil War. Jordan, like everyone else, is caught up in great forces that are beyond specific human control. Even Golz, the Republican commanding general, is powerless to forestall the attack once it is set in motion to almost certain failure. Each individual must decide for themselves how they will deal with these forces. Some choose duty; some choose to delight in cruelty. The partisan bands that Jordan recruits are bands of individuals each with their own motivations. They are together but each is alone in dealing with the overwhelming social forces driving the civil war. The novel is a series of character sketches revealing possible responses. Each must choose their own way and each must do this alone just as  Jordan does at the beginning and the end of the novel.","summary":"Individuals Reacting to Overwhelming Social Forces","unixReviewTime":1483228800,"vote":null,"image":null}

About 90% of the plot is delivered via conversations between the characters in a sort of proletariat narrative style that I found tiresome after only a few pages. I confess that I must lack the elevated culture needed to appreciate the rich imagery and gripping themes of such a complicated novel. It might have been easier if I didn't have to wade through the \"thee\" and \"thine\" and if Hemingway had just told the story instead of writing 480 pages of forced dialogue.\n\nTo me it was an over-complicated story about a communist college professor who leaves America to go fight in a communist rebellion in Spain during which he is ordered to blow up a bridge.

The purported purpose may have ceased to exist, in case it ever existed. Once we begin, we just march on. The costs are enormous in the times of war and strife, but they are not small even in times like ours.\n\nThe book is hailed for on the ground portrayal of the lives of fighters. This is absolutely right. Warring soldiers live every day on which pantheons can be and should be written to ensure that those who decide to throw them into these situations do not make their decisions lightly.\n\nDespite his age-appropriate biases, the author creates a good set of characters and interactions. Some scenes are absolutely haunting - the most exceptional is Pilar's story. As common in any good literary classic, there are many hidden themes and imputed messages. While the reader is rarely given respite from the upcoming doom, there is enough to keep one positive.\n\nThe language is certainly overly wordy with too many repetitions - not only in dialogues but also in other descriptions. Various characters' musings appear somewhat arbitrary as the author would frequently speak the mind of some like Pilar, Robert or Agustin but not others like Pablo or Maria. Towards the end, the perspective changes also appear out of place as the author would often wonder away from Robert and his surroundings - something which does not happen earlier (the shift would always be in someone's thoughts or back stories).\n\nThe message is darkest when one is made to realize how everyone is going through the motions, fully knowing what is personally at stake and even recognizing that their idealistic goals that got them started were already waylaid. Unfortunately, recognition of this typically human blind spot will not make almost anyone reading too to behave any differently.","summary":"but they are not small even in times like ours.

But when I got to the stage where I was dreading picking up the book as I was finding it so monotonous, I decided enough was enough--it was going back to the library from whence it came.\n\nThe lengthy novel tells the story of Robert Jordan, a young American in the International Brigades attached to a republican guerrilla unit during the Spanish Civil War. As a dynamiter, he is assigned to blow up a bridge during an attack on the city of Segovia.\n\nBy the half-way point, he still hadn't blown up the bridge but was instead engaging in seemingly never-ending debate about why it needed blowing up, how to do it, whether or not everyone in his group was in favour of the destruction .....the list could go on but I will spare you. I turned each page wondering if it would be the culmination of 250 pages of planning but sadly it was not to be. Or maybe that was a good thing because the soldiers guarding the bridge were spared for another day.\n\nImagine writing down every single action you take in a typical day from morning until evening whether relevant and interesting or not. Then gather a group of people and ask them to do the same. Then merge the pages and you have this book.\n\nThere is limited bad language although I found it amusing that for the stronger language they have simply inserted the word \"obscenity\" whether it made sense or not. There is some violence and some sexual content. The content wasn't offensive enough to put me off.

What one can not deny, however, is Hemingways brilliant, surgical descriptions of what his characters feel, their thought processes, and their desires.\n\nSure, it is a war novel with some compelling battle scenes, but for me the essence, the beauty, of the novel lies in between these scenes.  If you want a fast, exciting, love story about the Spanish Civil War you might be better off looking elsewhere. But, if you want to know what killing and dying are like, what a broken leg or a bullet feel like, what absinthe or wine actually evoke in ones long-desiccated brain cells, or, what making love in the middle of the forest, in the middle of a cool night to a person you know you would like to spend eternity with but was only granted three days; in essence if you want to know what life, in its most fugacious of moments, is really like  then start reading For Whom the Bell Tolls and you will not be disappointed.","summary":"What being at war actually feels like","unixReviewTime":1474848000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Jones III","reviewText":"I recently re-read&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Old-Man-and-the-Sea\/dp\/B000FC0SH8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Old Man and the Sea<\/a>, and that proved to be the catalyst to re-read his masterpiece, which was the prime reason he won the Nobel Prize in 1954. He was a man of action who was also a writer. He actively sought, and eventually found the limelight, cultivating mentors like Gertrude Stein and Ezra Pound. I first read this work in 1968, when I was obtaining some personal lessons in partisan warfare, which included the blowing up of bridges but on the receiving end. I knew almost nothing about the Spanish Civil War, but recall a governmental form that I had to sign, indicating I was not a member of a whole bunch of possibly subversive organizations, including the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, whose last known member, Delmer Berg, died last month, at the age of 100.\n\nHemingways novel takes place over four days, in late May, 1937, in central Spain, in the mountains near Segovia, where it can still snow, and does. The Republican forces are attempting an offensive against the fascist forces of Francisco Franco. Robert Jordan, an American, is a Spanish professor from the University of Montana, with a long-term interest in Spain, nurtured by extensive travel there. In summer jobs in construction and mining, he learned the art of dynamiting. As other Americans did, with dollops of idealism, Jordan volunteered to fight for the Republicans. The commanding general for this particular offensive, Golz, has ordered Jordan to go behind fascist lines, link with a group of partisans, and blow up a bridge in order to prevent reinforcements from joining the attacked fascist forces.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the structure of the novel, and the manner in which Hemingway reveals information. For example, the paragraph immediately above is pieced together from information gradually revealed in the course of the narrative. Hemingway had gained penetrating insights into a range of people. There is excellent character development, often via the technique of flashbacks. Anselmo is 68, tough, who Jordan knows can still outwalk him in the mountains. Pablo and his wife, Pilar, are two of the most complex characters. The official diagnosis of PTSD did not exist during the Spanish Civil War, yet Pablo clearly had it. In one of the most searing portions of the novel, via a flashback, Hemingway describes when Pablo was fearless and ruthless. He led his forces in seizing a village under fascist control, executes the civil guard who have surrendered, and then forces the fascist members of the village to run a gauntlet, where they are flayed. It further degenerates into a drunken orgy of killing. And then Pablo says: if you think that was bad, you should have seen what happened when the fascists seized the village back three days thereafter. Pablo says: If you have not seen the day of revolution in a small town where all know all in the town and always have known all, you have seen nothing. It immediately brought to mind Salvador Dalis Soft Construction in Boiled Beans: Premonitions of the Spanish Civil War.\n\nThe unique character of Spain appears in the bullfight, the men who prove their manhood thusly, and the women who love them. Pablo was once a bullfighter, and Pilar loved the ritual, and cared for his wounds, all related via flashbacks. Hemingway also relates how the pre-Christian religion and rituals still impacted the fighting during the civil war. Small unit tactics and the hardware of war, coupled with the terrain, is depicted with care and accuracy. Who enjoys the killing, and who does it as a job? This was one of the questions raised in the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Hearts-and-Minds-The-Criterion-Collection\/dp\/B00006673L\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hearts and Minds (The Criterion Collection)<\/a>&nbsp;about a latter war, and is a recurring them in this novel. The military leadership?  Hemingway has Jordan say: There are no Grants, Shermans or Stonewall Jacksons, only McClellans. And the civilian leadership? Jordan has a brief interlude away from the war at the Gaylord Hotel in Madrid where the leadership congregated. He notes the cowards have fled to Valencia, and in Barcelona there are only political clowns acting out revolution.  He believed in the Republic as a form of government but the Republic would have to get rid of all of that bunch of horse thieves that brought it to the pass it was in when the rebellion started. Was there ever a people whose leaders were as truly their enemies as this one?\n\nLove, life, commitment. It is there too, in Jordans relationship with Maria, whose parents had been executed by the fascists, and she had her head shaved and was repeatedly raped. With death all around them, there love-making is intense, and it is Pilar who notes that it is an old gypsy belief that one has three opportunities in life to have love-making that is so intense that it can move the earth. Maria and Jordan have had that, and Pilar, now older and ugly, claims to have had it twice in her life. Is moving the earth in our past, or still to come, as it were?\n\nThere is much, much more, including the dramatic tension involved in Jordan sending a message to Golz about the upcoming offensive. Will it get there in time? Alas, how many interfere with the delivery of critical intelligence to the decision makers? And there is Jordans relationship with his grandfather, who fought in the American Civil War, and taught him about life, as well as his own father, who committed suicide, a cowardly act the author claims  and one must reflect on Hemingways own suicide a few years thereafter.\n\nOverall, a beautifully written complex novel that incisively looks at war, and the range of human behavior surrounding it, as well as love, and its intense moments. 5-stars, plus.","summary":"Three opportunities to make the earth move","unixReviewTime":1465776000,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

What makes this so unrealistic is that the book takes place entirely over only three days, and at the beginning of the book Jordan and Maria have not yet met. So, in the course of just THREE DAYS, we are expected to believe that they go from complete strangers to in love in a way that defies comprehension. Not only is this unrealistic, but it is also SO BORING. There are literally entire chapters of just Robert Jordan and Maria telling each other how much they love each other.\n\nThis book is described as a war novel, but its only a war novel in the sense that it takes place during the war. There is very little actual war that happens in this book.\n\nBasically, the book is boring.

It is almost always a reading that happened many decades ago, perhaps in school, and many people recall only the love story, the earth moved interludes likely to impress a young person.

There is not only the Republican guerilla Anselmo, an old man who weeps when he must kill the enemy sentry, but the Nationalist lieutenant Berrendo, who must order the beheading of the dead El Sordo and his men, but cannot watch it. I am certain that I did not appreciate the character of Pilar, the powerful woman who dominates the band of men that Robert Jordan joins in order to carry out his assigned bridge detonation. Her description how her husband and his allies murder a towns Fascist officials is unforgettable. And Jordan himself is a far more complicated figure than I recalled. The life he lives in the few days he spends in the mountains is (perhaps) more full and more worthy than the life he might have had as a professor of Spanish back in Montana. He sees, hears, and feels everything in a state of intense hyper-alertness. However, there is nothing sentimental in this novel, no glorification of war or machismo, just a sense of lives lived for a just cause, teetering on the edge of eternity.\n\nAnd then there are the planes, the mechanized and distant form of warfare feared and hated by the partisans. The impersonal bombs that rain down from on high are the future.\n\nM. Feldman","summary":"\"I read that.\" \"No, not really.\"","unixReviewTime":1459814400,"vote":null,"image":null}

It is a \"true\" story about the nature of war and how people affect it and are affected by it. What Mr Hemingway taught me is that he is a writer foremost and everything else after. He reminds us that he has been in actual war and that it affects very normal everyday people in generally awful ways. For them (us) there is no happy ending.\n\nIf, like me, you have put off reading Hemingway because his novels were set decades ago, please put aside your apprehension and pick up this (or any other) book by him.","summary":"Tenderness, love, betrayal, brutality, cowardice, redemption, heroism, death, beauty, ugliness, duty","unixReviewTime":1458259200,"vote":7.0,"image":null}

The use of syntax and older styles of modern English to show when they are speaking in Spanish (and having actual Spanish peppered in) was refreshing and felt authentic. The plot, they must blow up a bridge with a ragtag band of rebels to assist in an attack, was good. And, of course, the love story was believable. My one complaint is sometimes the internal narratives would go on, and on, and on, and on. It was effective as a literary device to show a rambling conscious, but it got tiresome. Other than that, Hemingway's beautiful descriptions of war, love, and even the mundane task of putting a notebook in a breast pocket of a baggy shirt are reasons to enjoy reading this book.

Aaron Bellamy","reviewText":"I haven't read much Hemingway, just 'Old man and the Sea' way back in middle school and The Sun Also Rises way back in my twenties. And a handful of stories. The Sun Also Rises really moved me. I once asked a girl in a bar what her favorite last line of any novel was, and she said \"Isn't it pretty to think so\" which is exactly what I was thinking, so I about fell out of my chair.\n\nThis book is very unusual. I can't say I enjoyed it all that much, but I certainly am thinking about it. Written as if it has been translated directly from Spanish to English, with expletives bleeped out via the word unprintable or obscenity, and conversations that go on and on and on about nothing (kind of like they do in real life). And all of it leads up to something we all know is going to happen... the bell's gonna toll, and it's gonna toll for thee. And when it does, the horror of war and the stupidity of human kind and the ridiculous game of life kind of rears up and slaps you in the face. There are some moments in here too, that just hurt to read, painful to read. Robert Jordan talking of his father's suicide and his lack of respect for his father. As a father myself, and of course knowing Hemingway's life struggles, this just burned to read. And old Anselmo, honorable Anselmo who will kill if he must, but will never enjoy it, never want it, his poor life. A part of me knows - even if it isn't true - that all these people in this book were real. Maybe amalgamations, maybe direct to page, and even if not, it doesn't matter, they are all real. And Pablo drinks wine, bowl after bowl, and it seems like the only answer. And maybe it was.\n\nSo why do people still talk about Hemingway... why is that word \"hemingway\" one that everyone knows... I think this book must be a big part of it. I haven't hit wikipedia yet, I don't want my thoughts tainted, but this novel strikes me as ahead of its time even now somehow. And like I said, I didn't really enjoy it. And honestly, this is my second stab at it. Got halfway through about ten years ago. But I get it. I get what the big deal is. And it is a big deal. A terrible stormy awful big deal.

The stilted dialogue (much of it presented as literal translations of Spanish) is irritating and unnecessarily drawn out.  Rather than having concise conversations, characters engage in irritating back-and-forth babble that serves no purpose (along the lines of:  \"I am going to check on the horses.\"  \"The horses?\"  \"Yes, the horses.\"  \"Those are fine horses.  Can I go?\"  \"No, man, you cannot go.\"  \"Are you sure I cannot go?\" etc., etc., until you are ready to pull your hair out).  The entire book could have been much more effectively told if it had been trimmed-down by at least a third.\n\nHemingway often reveals background information and history through thought sequences, but these are often awkwardly done.  He will interrupt a scene or even a conversation to have a character go on a mental frolic for, sometimes, several pages before returning to the story.  Since it is hard to imagine a person actually doing this -- one imagines that the character must have slipped into a several-minute trance to have thought so much -- it would have been much more effective and far less irritating to have conveyed this information via omniscient narration.\n\nIn addition to stylistic problems, the story suffers from horrible plot decisions by Hemingway.  As the story begins, Maria has only weeks earlier been imprisoned and gang-raped by fascist sympathizers, yet she is so smitten with Robert Jordan that she comes to him in the middle of his first night in camp and has sex with him.  To say this is horribly unrealistic is putting it mildly.  Making matters worse, Maria has to be one of the least-appealing female love interests in literary history:  she is portrayed as a simpering fool, stupid, whining, and generally irritating.  Any time there is serious work to be done or danger at hand, she turns into a ball of goo and wants to play kissy-face with Robert.  One expects her to break into baby-talk at any moment.\n\nA further plot problem involves the cunning Pablo.  After building up the tension with the guerrilla leader throughout the book, Pablo's ultimate betrayal and abrupt reconciliation are written so poorly as to be both anticlimactic and unbelievable.\n\nAll of that said, the book contains some well-drawn, complex characters -- particularly an older fighter named Anselmo -- and the last third of the story does have some excellent dramatic tension.  All in all, however, this is a case of an opportunity squandered.","summary":"Overrated","unixReviewTime":1444867200,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

It was published in 1940 and tells the story of Robert Jordan, a young American in the International Brigades attached to a republican guerrilla unit during the Spanish Civil War. As a dynamiter, he is assigned to blow up a bridge during an attack. Hemingway describes the life of leftist guerrilla fighters in a series of skirmishes and camp fire vignettes; plunging the reader into a world of pine tree forests and counter intelligence. The characters of the morally repugnant and swine-eyed Pablo, as well as the strong willed Pilar, are indeed memorable. What sets this novel apart from othersis Hemingways own economical and inimitable style. Hemingway wrote without ornamentation  a symptom of his having been a journalist  and could evoke great emotion with his select choice of words. The recount of Sordos last stand, for example, is a particularly harrowing part in the book. Hemingways larger than life reputation preceded him when he was alive. He won the Nobel Prize for literature; as well as a Pulitzer prize for his Novella The Old Man and the Sea. Hemingways fiction seemed to fuel the legend that surrounded him as an author. He had served as an ambulance driver in WW1and much later travelled to Spain as a journalist to cover the civil war there; and no doubt his first-hand experiences inspired and helped to colour his writing. The book has various themes at its heart such as idealism and the fight against fascism (ie. fighting the good fight)as well as death in war, the transitory nature of life etc. The title of the book, For whom the bell tolls, comes from a line in a John Donne poem and is in reference to the symbolic funeral bell and the kinship all men share because of their mortality - No man is an island, entire of itselfFor whom the bell tolls, It tolls for thee.","summary":"Rings a bell","unixReviewTime":1441324800,"vote":null,"image":null}

The book did what I dimly remembered it did: it showed the local, human dimension of the war rather than the history book battle of ideologies we usually see.  What I hadnt remmbered was the subtlety and complexity  of the love story. Ive always thought Hemingways ability to present love has been underrated by many people who prefer to focus on the unwillingness of many of his characters to talk about their feelings.  Its true, his characters generally don't have much to say on the subject, and even their inner monologues tend to be sparse, but Hemingway still manages to express his characters deep, vital and nuanced feelings. I think the lack of verbiage is part a reflection of the view expressed by many of his characters that it doesnt do to talk about significant things too much and part the simple fact that the characters themselves don't understand what they're feeling.\nHemingway was a fabulous writer, and much of his work, though clearly rooted in his time period, still stands up to scrutiny today.","summary":"Great presentation of a complex character","unixReviewTime":1441152000,"vote":12.0,"image":null}

That would be Hills Like White Elephants, which, like most US college students, I had to study in my short stories class.  Now, roughly 13 years later, I've been attempting to go back and read all the classics that my high school and university professors tried to get us to read.\n\nFor Whom the Bell Tolls is a gripping read.  Once you make it about a third of the way you will be hooked until the end.\n\nAs this is considered a classic, I read it with a slow, active reader's eye, paying as much attention to the prose and word choice as anything else.  The dialog is superb, even in spite of Hemingway's controversial choice of having the characters speak in an Old English style.  Reading it quickly becomes second nature.  Never have I seen so much character imbued in dialog.\n\nHemingway also doesn't overload the reader with details of setting.  He gives you just enough detail that you can project your own mental image and get on with the plot.\n\nThe action is well described.  Hemingway himself was involved in fighting in several wars, and his familiarity with combat really shows through in the battle scenes.\n\nThe prose isn't perfect.  Though Hemingway exercises his typical avoidance for large, ornate words, descriptions and dialog can be nonetheless wordy and flowery.  Pilar's description of the smell of death dragged on for pages, and was useless besides since her palm reading served the same plot purpose.  There are other passages in the book where I felt like Hemingway indulged a bit too much in wordiness.\n\nThat leads to the book being a touch too long.  If the wordiness had been wrangled in a bit and certain subplots excised, I think the book would have been a much tighter experience.\n\nStill, I think it's an excellent book.  It's definitely one that you will remember.","summary":"That would be Hills Like White Elephants","unixReviewTime":1440028800,"vote":null,"image":null}

Weber","reviewText":"I read this on the heals of Amanda Vaill's very good book \"Hotel Florida\" (Farrar, Strauss 2014) describing the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39 through the experiencing of it by Hemingway and others as correspondents and photographers.  Hemingway wrote this in 1940 with resounding success.\n\nA young American professor who teaches Spanish at a university in Montana signs on as a partisan volunteer.  It's because he's anti-fascist more so than being pro-Communist.  This is Robert Jordan a demolitions expert, a skill he learned after arriving in Spain.  He's known now as a dynamiter.\nHe becomes part of a small group, 8 or 9 insurgents, hiding out in the mountains near Segovia making their home in a cave.  They are a motley group, which is part of the charm of the novel.  The dialogue between them and Jordan is a major part of the story.  Who can be trusted?  Who has the nerve to carry out their responsibiltiy?  Can this person be depended on or should he be knifed or shot?  It's rich with characterization.\n\nMarie has been brought into the group.  Young, charming, and having been sexually abused and hair growing out after having been cut off as part of the cruelty inflicted on her.  She and Roberto are a match from the start.  They pledge their enduring love.\n\nRoberto's assignment is to blow up a bridge in the hinterland.  This  is easy enough.  Two guards are on duty at all times and 5-6 others are billeted close by to take their turns.  They can be eliminated.  The problem is that the bridge must be blown at just the right time; as soon as Roberto hears the bombardment that signals the Spanish attack.  The purpose is to cut off the resupply of the rebel (Franco's) forces which must cross over the bridge to get to the battleground.  Blow it too soon and the rebels will be alerted and throw pontoons across; the element of surprise is lost.  Too late, and the rebels will be crossing the bridge and it will be impossible to take out the bridge.  To compound Robert Jordan's problems  a traitor in his group has stolen all the dynamite caps.  Not only must the dynamite be fastened in place under the bridge at the key places in the structure, but it must be detonated by hand grenades with the triggers pulled by long thin strings to places of shelter on the shore.  And the guards have to be eliminated before any of this.\n\nHemingway is at his best in building suspense.  Can they kill the guards?  Can Jordan attach the dynamite and the grenades?  Will it work?  Can he get it done before the bombardment signals that the bridge must be blown?  Can they escape?  Is Marie safe (she's guarding their horses)?\n\nDon't expect this book to make you a historian of the War, but it will acquaint you with backwoods guerrilla war, the atrocities, the idiocies, the evil that corrupts a soldier's soul.","summary":"It Tolls for Thee","unixReviewTime":1435363200,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

I really enjoyed this books exciting plot and the deep themes of the horror of war and the need to use sensibility as well as your head during your battle. The way the book was structured around the cycles of life, and the \"wheel of human conflict\" was also very engaging. I especially enjoyed how over the course of the novel Robert Jordan became increasingly connected to the land, Maria, and therefore himself. The evolution of his character over the course of the novel from a throughly practical man, to a more earthly and spiritual one was especially unique. It brought a great voice to this book. Another theme that I really liked was the similarity between the Fascist soldiers and the Republican soldiers. This shows how war is only arbitrary and politics only run skin deep. War is a modern menace that disrupts the simple natural way of living. Finally, the criticism of both sides in the war represted that war is between two flawed sides, with normal people caught in the middle.\n\nSome things that I didn't like about the book were the flatness of the characters of the women, Maria especially. I felt that they did not evolve over the course of the book and were often viewed as weak and causes of problems. Another issue I had with the book was that Hemingway provided almost no context to the story, so I had to read about the Spanish Civil war before I could continue with the story.","summary":"I really enjoyed this books exciting plot and the deep themes of ...","unixReviewTime":1435276800,"vote":null,"image":null}

I have previously read some of Hemingways short stories which had his famous sparse style. The writing in this novel, however, while clear and crisp, has a rhythm and generous beauty that makes the reading almost sumptuous. My only warning for would-be buyers of this book: be patient to get the most from the novel.\n\nThe story is set during the Spanish civil war in the 1930s. Robert Jordan, an American professor of Spanish, has come over to help the Republic fight the Fascists as a demolition man. He is sent to blow up a bridge at a specific day and time, creating a countdown where, as a result of the diminishing hours, he spends four intense days with a small guerrilla force, creating tight, intimate relationships.\n\nIll be honest. The first half of the book put me to sleep; but Im not saying this as a criticism, I swear! The language was so mesmerizing, repetitive, and rhythmic, that it created a hypnotic effect that kept making me drowsy. I had to be so patient. I couldn't read with any distractions and often read only a dozen or so pages at a time to help with my focus.\n\nThe second half of the book, in stark contrast, accentuates the countdown to blowing up the bridge. The plot started to fly by, and I found myself going faster through the writing than I wanted to. I had to really focus on keeping my reading at a steady pace to catch all of the narrative and not skip anything. Again, I found I needed all my patience and focus, but in an entirely different way.\n\nThere are no bad parts to this book. The characters, language, pacing, plot, everything is well done. Chapters often set aside the plot for a while as characters give us their personal anecdotal histories or conversations, but these asides add so much depth to the narrative that they seem integral to the whole story.\n\nHeres my example of his writing style on pg. 323, Chapter 27: Dying was nothing and he had no picture of it. But living was a field of grain blowing in the wind on the side of a hill. Living was a hawk in the sky. Living was an earthen jar of water in the dust of the threshing with the grain flailed out and the chaff blowing. Living was a horse between your legs and a carbine under one leg and a hill and a valley and a stream with trees along it and the far side of the valley and the hills beyond. Theres nothing about the style here thats sparse. Repetitive and clear, but so lovely as the time that I find it captivating.\n\nI was in a book club that read this, and I can tell you the only downside to this book is that we all agreed so well upon it, the conversation lacked any good argument or intensity (although we did understood the novel much better afterwards). I encourage book groups to read this book as there is so much depth here to explore; I easily created pages of discussion questions and could create so many more if I spent more time with the book. This would also make an excellent book for anyone interested in reading classics. Someday Im going to read this book again, and I know that Ill get even more out of it then.","summary":"Looking for a Hemingway book?

Hemingway is never overly explicit. Each scene and character serves multiple purposes. The author weaves his themes of humanity, the morality of war and each metaphysical peal of the \"bell\" into his narration, slowly building up to the climax.\nTherein lies the problem with this classic novel. It is very slow and tedious with enough archaisms to rival your KJV Bible. You'll also be running for your Spanish dictionary, as Hemingway cleverly substitutes all foul language by either changing the English spelling (\"Muck\" for the f-bomb for example) or inserting the Spanish word as he does when one character refers to two others as \"Maricones.\" The book's setting (Spain) isn't readily apparent at first so don't feel bad if you get lost. Look for Hemingway's nod to Gertrude Stein on page 289.\nThe main plot is introduced immediately. The protagonist and his new group of friends must blow up a bridge as an act of war. Unfortunately, it takes them over 400 pages to do this. Everyone talks too much in this book. Everyone has a story to tell. Stream of consciousness abounds, serving more as filler than enhancing the plot. The three days they spend planning, discussing and contemplating the risks of their mission feel like a lifetime.\nIndeed, even the main protagonist himself, Robert Jordan, thinks on this, as his life is especially changed after meeting and falling in love with the beautiful \"honey bunny\" Maria (who is affectionately referred to as \"rabbit\" which comes off as misogynistic but, hey, that's Hemingway!) Their gentle love story and Hemingway's fascinating ability to create inoffensive sex scenes in a sleeping bag were all that kept me turning pages. There's also an implied impregnation at the end. Robert, Maria and Pilar would've make quite the kick-ass team going after Maria's rapists and avenging all the Boco Harams of the world. But in the words of Tony Stark to Dum-E, \"You are a tragedy,\" because that's the novel Hemingway set out to write.\nI think it's safe to say he succeeded.\nRead this book, then watch the excellent 1943 movie adaptation.","summary":"You Are a Tragedy","unixReviewTime":1431993600,"vote":null,"image":null}

For Whom the Bell Tolls, though, I enjoyed thoroughly and found much more engaging than, say, The Sun Also Rises or short stories like the heavily anthologized A Clean, Well-Lighted Place.  For a Lost Generation tale of gentry drinking binges, give me Fitzgeralds poetic Gatsby over Hemingways Sun Also Rises. But For Whom the Bell Tolls is a different matter. The prose has the simple directness of Sun Also Rises, but the subject matter turns on the life-and-death situations of guerilla warfare during the Spanish Civil War, giving a dramatic intensity to those clean, simple sentences. And to a large extent, Hemingway seems, like his contemporary William Carlos Williams, to want to keep the language transparent and give us the thing in itself. Indeed, he sounds as though he quotes Williams when he has his main character ponder the confidence that comes from thinking back to concrete things. This allows him to build a very powerful sense of place, both with the direct, no-nonsense descriptive sentences and with the bastardized (but accessible) English-Spanish dialogue.\n\nBut the prose is more subtle in For Whom the Bell Tolls, as Hemingway seems more sure of his voice here than he was in The Sun Also Rises. The occasional flashbacks and stream-of-consciousness shoots of prose mark this or that character with a special immediacy, with a reflective inner life. And the reflections may be terse and unadorned, but they are not simplistic philosophically. They seem fully commensurate with the life-and-death context, and indeed, from the vantage of this novel, it is the overwrought philosophies of the ivory tower that seem frivolous and simplistic.\n\nSo if it happens that youve read a few stories or The Sun Also Rises and found yourself less than fully engaged, you should still give For Whom the Bell Tolls a try. To each his own, but for me, the latter is more the Nobel Prize-worthy Hemingway.","summary":"Hemingway on point","unixReviewTime":1431475200,"vote":null,"image":null}

The guy who invented modern English literature and all that. He fought wars and this book is about one of them, the Spanish Civil War, which Hemingway witnessed as a reporter. Here, the main character is also an American, in this case an university professor who decided to fight for the Spanish republic and is caught in the midst of a guerrilla group trying to demolish a bridge, a secret mission given to him by a Russian general who is planning an offensive to change the course of the war against the fascists. Our hero arrives at his destination and, in four days everything happens: he finds the love of his life, he understands that maybe the noble cause of the republicans is already corrupt, he reconciles with his father, he understands all about human nature and, well, it is only possible that all that finishes in one way. Honestly, it is a bit to much and at certain points the book suffers from the urge that Hemingway has to get it quickly and exhaustively. Some passages are very good, even memorable, but in general it was a dragging experience. It took me much more than the four days during which the story unfolds to finish it. Worth the reading, for purely historical reasons, but I left with something missing here. And a bit disappointed.","summary":"Expected more...","unixReviewTime":1425168000,"vote":null,"image":null}

His writing, in my opinion, is boring and confusing.  I did not care for his grammar or run-on sentences.  I found it difficult to follow his use of the word \"obscenity\" in place of the actual word.  I finally caught on half way through a long paragraph.  He also switches from using \"thee\" and \"thou\" to \"you\" and \"your.\"  It was just confusing to follow.  Other than that, the story was good, though his descriptions are tedious.

I first read Hemingway (The Sun Also Rises) in college, more than fifty years ago. I remember at the time being unimpressed, unlike many of the reviewers of that book here on Amazon.\n\nMy goal in life has been, for years, to read at least one of the classics each month. So I am quite able to appreciate the differences in various writing styles starting with Homer and all  his descendants.\n\nFor example, a few months ago I read Lord Jim, by James Conrad. As a reader, I found it quite intriguing. As a writer, I found myself highlighting many passages that caught my imagination with Conrads beautiful prose that delivered complex ideas or emotions, and vivid descriptions that imprinted themselves on my mind.\n\nIn contrast, in FWTBT I found only two passages particularly memorable. The writing, aside from its many new and unique techniques, is definitely literary, as opposed to the story-tellers. I also found Hemingways style to be ponderous and repetitious\nSo if the reader is searching for a good, compelling story that holds your interest while it delivers its message, then FWTBT will leave you disenchanted. If you are seeking a literary tale that describes the confusion and immorality of war, then Hemingway will not disappoint.","summary":"Reviewing a true classic of American literature is never easy, and in the case of Hemingways For Whom ...","unixReviewTime":1420416000,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

JOHN DONNE\n\nIf you haven't noticed, I read a lot of Hemingway.  The reason for this is that I enjoy (even more) a textbook about him that was written by a Princeton Professor, Carlos Baker.  He understands Hemingway and shares that knowledge in a way that shows the artfulness of the writer.  He diagrams the novels in the same way that my grade school teachers taught me to diagram sentences (noun, verb, adverb and subject, object of the preposition, adjectives and compound sentences, etc.).  Using this textbook I am learning how a writer approaches a novel (as an artist would); hence the title, \"HEMINGWAY, the writer as artist\".  It is one of my favorite books and has been for more than ten years.\n\nFor Whom the Bell Tolls (FWBT) was published in 1940, but the notes for it were taken during '37, '38 '39.  It speaks of the loyalist fighting against fascism in Spain.  His detractors called Hemingway a 'Stalinist' or a 'Fascist' at the extremes, but he was neither.  He was simply anti-fascist.  He thought that fascism killed art and literature.  It was just that easy for him to pick a side.\nHis novel is broad in scope and speaks garishly of the cruel killings by both sides.\nHe goes into great detail of an incident in which the 'loyalists' torture and kill local fascist shop owners, blowhards, idiots, city officials and priests in a way that is foreign to any experience of my sheltered life. Hemingway shocks the reader by writing the details of killing in a way that reminds us of a bull fight, or the running of the bulls at Pamplona.  This chapter is hard to read.  It is so cruel.

They are all bad in different ways, but For Whom the Bell Tolls is particularly bad. This is the one where \"the earth moves\"! The one where the Spanish speak a weird and annoying 18th century English. The one where Hemingway's supposedly terse style can go on for dozens of pages of very boring digressions.

Hemingway was a reporter in Spain during that country's civil war (1936-39), so he knows firsthand about what he is writing - not merely the landscape and city names, but the mindset of the people, the devastation wrought by the war, the inhumanity of each side toward the other, and all the small human tragedies interwoven with the national tragedy.  The dialogue might seem strange to someone who doesn't know Spanish; all the dialogue is written as if it were directly translated from Spanish, including the formal addresses \"thee\" and \"thou,\" and things like that.  If you know Spanish it won't bother you; if you don't know Spanish, the dialogue (although not the narration) reads a bit like Shakespeare, and maybe even makes this book feel a little more classy than his other writing.  At the end of the day, I love Hemingway, and he is a legend for a reason.  Buy this book.","summary":"A small slice of a national tragedy","unixReviewTime":1407542400,"vote":null,"image":null}

There is a boatload of this dialog and I felt it detracts from the story, since in this modern age such terms seem archaic. One feels as if he's reading the King James Bible at times.

I'd read The Old Man and The Sea a long time ago and I was curious about Hemingway's masterpiece, but once I started to read it I found it difficult to get into the story. One thing that contributed to that was the writing style. I had heard that it was raw and that the writing was very blunt, but I found it to be beyond that. Sometimes I had the feeling that I was reading a telegram. Specially when it came to the dialogues. Had Hemingway put a stop word at the end of a dialogue sentence and I wouldn't be surprised!\n\nA thing that I found unnecessary was the romance. The only way for me to describe Robert Jordan's and Maria insta love is by calling it Tarzan level. It can me summarized into this: We just met, but I love thee! Thou loves me? Let us get into bed and do things! - end of love story. So I ask: why? Why put romance into this when there's none?\n\nWhere I found interest in this story was in Robert Jordan's thoughts and feelings towards his path in life and his faith.\n\nSo, in short I didn't dislike it but I can say I liked it as well.\n\nOne final note is that this edition is censored and whenever there is a swear word in English it's replaced by the word obscenity (which in some situations ends up being quite funny given the context). All the swear words in Spanish are uncensored.","summary":"This is the longest telegram I have ever read","unixReviewTime":1405209600,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

I read 'The Old Man and the Sea' many, many years ago ( it was really my inspiration and beginning to what has become a lifelong love of books and reading), and I felt I needed to read more to find out what all the fuss was about. Well, this story may have been gripping in 1935 or 1940 or whenever it was written, but I am struggling to finish it. There is of course the ubiquitous double standard for men and women that was the accepted way of life in its time. I understand all that but its like reading about things that happened on another planet. There's the addressing of each other as 'thee' and 'thou' which I'm guessing has something to do with translating Spanish to English but as the book is in English I have to wonder why this is even addressed. Also, why are all the characters referred to by their first names : 'Pilar', 'Maria', etc., but our hero the protagonist is always identified by both first and last names? It was annoying at first - but I've become used to it at this point I guess. I've suspect that this story is NOT going to have a happy ending but I don't know for sure yet. I don't think Maria is going to get her chance at a lifetime of happiness which would undoubtedly consist of making babies and stew for R.J.","summary":"Sorry, Papa. but you're dating yourself","unixReviewTime":1404000000,"vote":null,"image":null}

He goes into the mountains to meet with a band of rebels who are to help him destroy the bridge and attack the base on the other side of the bridge. Jordan meets and falls in love with a young Spanish woman Maria and the story reaches it's climax when he is forced to make a tough decision and blow the bridge without the proper equipment.\n\nLike many of Hemingway's novels, For Whom the Bell Tolls was quite wordy.

As a dynamiter, he has been assigned to blow up a bridge at a certain time, three days away. In the mean time, he must win over the local guerrillas and procure their help.\n\nIn For Whom the Bell Tolls, Hemingway crafted a near-perfect novel. The characters goals are clear. Their motivations and stakes are high. Their problems and setbacks are many. Everybody is flawed and damaged, some considerably more than others. And their dangerous task looms relentlessly over every interaction as the plot progresses. From the start, the reader knows that 1) either they will or will not success in \"blowing\" the bridge and 2) its almost certain some of the characters will die in the process. By the end, I had come to love and root hard for Robert Jordan and his strange band as they went to their task.\n\nHemingway is a master at getting inside the heads of his characters. Through their thoughts, he examines love and war, honor and cowardice, respect, fear of loneliness, God and religions, and the atrocities human beings commit against others during war.\n\nThe characters speech often sounds very literally translated Spanish. Example: What passes with thee? For me, that and the sprinkling of actual Spanish contribute to the authentic feel of the story. The back-and-forth arguments Robert Jordan carries on in his mind are fantastically written as are the scenes about truly great love. Seventy-five years after For Whom the Bell Tolls was published, the story and themes are as profound and beautiful as ever.","summary":"After 75 years, still a masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1397865600,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

The dialogue is so choppy & forced-formal that it seems like the characters are all talking past each other.  I think it must have something to do with a Spanish translation but it really distracted from the plot.  Bottom line is that I have seldom gotten less involved in a story.  I made it 3\/4 of the way through & decided that I did not care if the bridge got blown  up or not and stopped.  I just found the whole thing to be a bloated and a drudging read for what should have been a rather simple (and exciting) story.  I think more than anything else it was the dialogue that put me off, but it will definitely be my last encounter with Hemingway.\n\nI don't know - maybe I am missing something but I really did not enjoy this book one bit, and have encountered more believable dialogue in a Mel Bay film.  To each their own, I guess.","summary":"Maybe I am missing something","unixReviewTime":1395619200,"vote":17.0,"image":null}

It was the final epic scene upon the bridge. You'll know the one when you get there. I started to cry. I felt it coming for a few chapters, and then finally it came out and I wept. I'd never done that with a novel before, cried, and I didn't stop myself. It wasn't that the story was the saddest thing I'd ever read or imagined. It's a Hemingway novel, and my favorite author has a way of punching you in the stomach when he's closing out a novel. For examples check out 'A Farewell to Arms' or 'Islands in the Stream'. So I wasn't too surprised to see how this epic magnificent novel was unfolding in its final tragic and violent glory. What suddenly struck me like an icy blade into my heart was the realization that I was reading the truest book that I'd ever read and probably would ever read. The enormity of that was too much to bear. I felt as if I was there, and all the emotions that came in something so highly stressful, dutiful and chaotic came flooding in. Let me say that I'm a veteran of the US Army and I was deployed to the Middle East in 2009, but that I've never shot at another person or killed anyone. But I have, however, been in numerous very high stress situations that flooded my core with anxiety and a sense of duty. Reading 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' rubbed some of those scars raw and I'm thankful for that. I'm not angered that Hemingway's utterly poignant writing showed me things that I'd left behind in the darkest days of my own life. This novel showed me, in the truest way imaginable, that there is such beauty and love to be found in duty and conflict, and it showed me that there's nothing wrong in fighting and standing your ground for something that may not survive the test of time, just as the rebel guerrillas in Spain were ultimately doomed to fail against the Fascists.

It's the Spanish Civil War before World War 2 with the Loyalists against the Fascists. Gary Cooper plays Robert Jordan, a dynamite expert not interested in life until he meets Ingrid Bergman who plays an orphan girl that was mishandled by the Fascists. They fall in love until an untimely end. The music is by Victor Young & many say this is his finest creation. Typical 1940ish bombastic semi-classical music intermixed with Spanish dancing tunes.

This is the question that haunts Robert Jordan throughout FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS. Leaving behind his respectable life as an American college Spanish-language teacher, he has become an accomplished guerrilla fighter and explosives expert fighting for the anti-fascists in the Spanish Civil War. Can he really find a new \"family,\" fall head over heels in love, and strike a blow that will further the rebel cause and lay his own personal ghosts to rest ... in just four days? Well, he's going to give it one almighty try, because when that fourth day arrives, he is sure there will be no tomorrow.\n\nAnd so, Robert Jordan, ordered to blow up a bridge to enable the anti-government forces' latest attack, attaches himself to a ragtag band of hardened guerrilla fighters, currently hiding out in a cave in the hills near the bridge. In the cave, he finds a band of unstable, hotheaded misfits, a band of unique and beguiling individuals, a band that is sheltering a frightened \"little rabbit.\" But they are very few, and the task Robert Jordan has brought them is very great. Can he possibly lead them to a glorious, unlikely success, or will he lead them to their doom and his own? The story is haunted by the concept that: \"Whether one has fear of it or not, one's death is difficult to accept.\" This is the scene that Hemingway sets, and being Hemingway, all he does is tell us: These are the people, this is what happened to them, this is what they did, this is what they said. And being Hemingway, that is more than enough.\n\nHemingway's famously \"economical\" style can sometimes border on the cold, clinical, and flat, but in this book, he loosens the reins just slightly, with very effective results. The moments of fast-paced action are often very dialogue-driven; in quieter moments, there are little oases of slightly more wordy descriptions of surroundings or feelings; and sensual moments are a tumbling bundle of words and images that hardly even constitute sentences at all, but are intensely moving. Overall, the style of FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is still characteristically Hemingway - matter-of-fact, pointed, with not a word out of place. The dialogue is still jarringly clipped, but that's what makes it so stirring. There are moments of maddening, excessive repetition, but they are like hammer strokes driving the point home. Once again, Hemingway does everything that should make a story fall flat - but instead, it soars. Don't try this at home, folks. This is something beyond the powers of mere mortals; this is something found only in the realms of genius.\n\nCharacterization and character development are particularly strong in FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS. In his usual way, Hemingway introduces us to all the characters of the story in situ, withholding any hint of their histories and making us earn the right to know them better by waiting and dwelling with them for some considerable time first. It seems that we are meant to get to know these characters in the present so as to deserve the privilege of knowing anything about their pasts, and so as to understand that the present is really all that matters. But by the time we have got to know them that well, all we can think about is their futures: Who will survive the dangerous mission before them?\n\nRobert Jordan is the typical Hemingway leading man - mysterious, enigmatic, physically and emotionally strong but not invulnerable. Initially appearing to be made of stone, it is the \"little rabbit,\" Maria, a victim of unspeakable war crimes who has found refuge with the guerrilla band, who steadily chips away at \"Roberto's\" facade to reveal the human being beneath. And this human being is all too mortal and all too susceptible to the dread of leading his new Spanish \"family\" to their doom. And the enigma remains: Why is this American fighting in somebody else's war? Meanwhile, the cast of peripheral characters in FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is as vibrant and varied as the contents of a paella. In the wait for zero hour, these characters are revealed one by one: Anselmo, the gentle-hearted \"old man\"; Fernando, the pedant; Agustin, the fervent revolutionary; Rafael, the unreliable gypsy. And then there is Pilar, a character who could never be accused of being \"peripheral.\" Mercurial, certainly, but never peripheral: she is surely one of Hemingway's strongest female characters - by turns worldly, zealous, kind, cruel, loyal, bitter, and as tough as old boots. When it comes to the crunch, we are right there with these very real characters as they march with their heads held high and their hearts in their boots into the impossibly dangerous situation devised for them by the powers-that-be, the powers-that-should-damn-well-know-better.\n\nFOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is reminiscent of Hemingway's other war story, A FAREWELL TO ARMS, in the attention it gives to the way in which war turns men into monsters. Pilar's recounting of the first day of the revolution in her own village plus the underlying threat of insurrection within the guerrilla band's own ranks provide chilling evidence of the evil that lurks in the souls of ordinary men and women. In the memorable words of Agustin, \"War is a bitchery.\" Robert and Anselmo, in particular, struggle throughout with the Machiavellian concept of killing for the sake of their higher cause. Is this really all there is to it, or do they take some kind of perverse pleasure in the taking of a life? And can they be honest enough, at least with themselves, to admit it?\n\nThese themes of personal guilt and responsibility lead inevitably to contemplation of who the enemy really is. At one point, Robert remarks that one side of a revolution usually garners greater attention than the other. Hemingway makes it abundantly clear, however, that FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is not going to perpetuate this injustice, and great pains are taken to emphasize that \"the enemy\" are people, too. From the personal effects of an enemy scout to a peek through the window at the occupants of an enemy guardpost to actual narrative space given to the enemy in a bloody skirmish, the reader is never allowed to forget that both sides of the conflict share a common humanity. When all is said and done, Robert reflects on that part of himself that is the core of all soldiers, no matter who they fight for: \"In him, too, was despair from the sorrow that soldiers turn to hatred in order that they may continue to be soldiers.\"\n\nAnd when faced with the horrors of war, the minds of soldiers often turn to religion, another central theme of FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS. Robert and his newly Communist comrades are supposed to have renounced religion altogether, and there are many jokes about their now ex-Lord and Savior. Anselmo, however, is quietly wracked with uncertainty over renouncing the beliefs of a lifetime, and in a particularly moving scene, he wishes for the opportunity to undertake some form of religious penance, once the war is over, for the lives he has taken. And when the battle for the bridge is finally waged, both sides turn to prayer as their last resort.\n\nFOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is a magnificent rendition of the hypocrisy, farce, and senselessness of war. This, in itself, makes the book a superb, thought-provoking, soul-searching classic. But it is also arguably Hemingway's greatest love story. Robert and Maria's story is so much more than just a whirlwind romance, it is an exquisitely tender, desperately passionate joining of two lost but beautiful souls. As ridiculous as it may sound, Robert and Maria will make you believe that true love can blossom and burn in the space of just four days. This pair would do anything for each other. They want to live a full life together, but they won't hesitate to die for one another, either. Will they have to?\n\nI do not make this statement lightly: FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is the most perfectly paced novel I have ever read. In the beginning, the story chugs along sedately, giving you time to meet and greet your fellow passengers and accustom yourself to your surroundings. In the last third of the book, you start to hear the whistle blowing and feel the story picking up speed. In the last fifty or so pages, you're holding on to this runaway train for dear life. By the end, you've gone past the edge of your seat and are kneeling on the floor praying for these characters, and especially these two lovers, to survive. \"I wish that I were going to live a long time instead of going to die today because I have learned much about life in these four days; more, I think, than in all the other time.\" This is Robert Jordan's musing when the battle is finally joined, and it made me realize that I had also learned much about life from the four days, the lifetime, contained in the pages of this unprepossessing, riveting novel. The thing that makes me so passionate about books is that when they're really, really good, they make my eyes sparkle and my heart beat faster. FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS held me mesmerized and took my breath away. It is one of those books I will never forget. It is a masterpiece.","summary":"Hemingway at his haunting best","unixReviewTime":1387238400,"vote":7.0,"image":null}

It is a book that has inspired its fair share of leaders over the years, and will do the same for you. It's simply that good!\n\nWith two masterpieces under his belt (The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms), which described in crushing detail the physical and emotional wounds suffered during war, of love lost and hope destroyed, and of the depression and disillusionment experienced by the group of Americans known as the Lost Generation, Ernest Hemingway could have written nothing else and he already would have gone down as one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. Then in 1940, he published For Whom the Bell Tolls, which would become another masterpiece, the master at his best, writing about all of the themes that had become central to his life: Courage, duty, love, death, honor and idealism.\n\nIt is the story of Robert Jordan, an American demolition specialist attached to a band of Spanish guerrillas sent to destroy bridges during the Spanish Civil War. He is a professional, and knows his mission is a bad one, that is unlikely to make any real difference in the fight, but for some reason he feels compelled to complete it anyways.\n\nOver three days of hiding out with a band of rebels, he falls in love with a beautiful young Spanish girl named Maria. He also realizes how doomed their mission really is and that he must accept what fate has given him, and do his duty regardless, however bitter it may be. He must press on to destroy the bridges he came to destroy.\n\nJordan proves that life, no matter how long or short, can be deeply heroic and full of purpose when we take the right action. He convinces himself of this through his own self-talk, which Hemingway gives to us throughout the book as a sort of code of ethics, a model to live by:\n\n\"So if your life trades its seventy years for seventy hours I have that value now and I am lucky enough to know it. And if there is not any such thing as a long time, nor the rest of our lives, nor from now on, but there is only now, why then now is the thing to praise and I am very happy with it... You must make your whole life in the two nights that are given to you; that living as we do now you must concentrate all of that which you should always have into the short time that you can have it... You have it now and that is all your whole life is; now. There is nothing else than now. There is neither yesterday, certainly, nor is there any tomorrow. How old must you be before you know that? There is only now, and if now is only two days, then two days is your life and everything in it will be in proportion. This is how you live a life in two days. And if you stop complaining and asking for what you never will get, you will have a good life. A good life is not measured by any biblical span.\"\n\nJordan exhibits exactly the type of \"grace under pressure\" that Hemingway admired and was famous for. He demonstrates that action, not outcome, is what counts, and that, despite everything else, there is great value in doing one's duty against overwhelming odds.\n\nIn For Whom the Bell Tolls, Hemingway tells this story with his characteristic prose, tragically and poetically, as only he can. It is his greatest work. If you choose to read one Hemingway, make it this one. It will inspire you for many years.","summary":"Hemingway's Best","unixReviewTime":1387065600,"vote":null,"image":null}

I have also been reading a fair amount about Hemingway lately. I have learned a great deal about Hemingway's technique, and I have come to admire his craft and artistry, but I have not been able to find any Hemingway book that really moved me or, in my mind, justified his reputation or popularity. Until now. I just finished For Whom the Bell Tolls and I was blown away. I finally feel like I have some understanding of why people love Hemingway and why he is such an important writer. This is, in my opinion, by far Hemingway's best novel. There are, I think, a few reasons for that.\n\nFirst, the novel has the most engaging plot of the Hemingway novels I have read. In general, plot is not all that important to me. I tend to be more interested in the quality of the writing and the philosophical ideas contained in a novel. It was surprising to me, therefore, what a difference having an interesting plot made in terms of my enjoyment of the book. I guess plot does matter! The novel is about an American helping a band of guerillas in the Spanish Civil War blow up a bridge. The novel is very exciting and tense in places and Hemingway paces things perfectly. POSSIBLE SPOILER. The climactic scene on the bridge was, in my opinion, perfectly paced. Hemingway slows things down, not enough to bore the reader, but just enough to keep them on the edge of their seat. Anyone who wants to learn how to pace an action scene would do well to study the bridge scene closely. I was mesmerized.\n\nSecond, the characters were more interesting than the usual Hemingway characters. I do not tend to like any of Hemingway's characters all that much but I was surprised that I liked all the characters in this book. Robert Jordan is a professional, as so many of Hemingway's heroes are, but he is a likable professional. He has heart and understanding. He forgives people their faults and weaknesses and he is noble. He is also capable of great passion. Pilar and Pablo are very interesting characters as well, each in their own way. I think Hemingway could have done a little better with Maria. She was, of all the characters, the least well drawn to me. She felt secondary to me, like she was put in as a means of making Robert Jordan more interesting, as opposed to being her own independent character with an independent value. Still, the relationship between Robert and Maria was powerful.\n\nThird, this novel comes later in Hemingway's career and his style has developed a great deal since The Sun Also Rises. The Sun Also Rises is told in very plain and very direct prose. There is very little lyricism. In For Whom the Bell Tolls Hemingway still uses what he learned from his earlier direct style but it is much more lyrical and beautiful. Everything that was great about his early style is still here but it is better. There is genuine lyricism in the prose. There is no doubt in my mind that Hemingway continued to grow as an artist and this book seems to me to be his most mature statement as an artist. He restrained himself for a long time, he learned control, and here, he has what seems to me to be a carefully controlled unrestraint, as paradoxical as that might sound. He is like a horse trainer who finally has enough control over his horse to let it run wild sometimes. He does not have to keep it tethered all the time.\n\nEven more than the lyricism, however, there is passion and feeling in the prose. One of the things I did not like about Hemingway's early style was his penchant for affectless understatement and ironic detachment. I am by no means an expert in Hemingway's development or style but I do not remember any passages like this in The Sun Also Rises \"He looked at her brown face and at the eyes that, since he had seen them, had never been as young as the rest of her face but now were suddenly hungry and young and wanting\" (67). You can feel the longing in that prose. You can picture Hemingway typing those words and getting caught up in the passion as opposed to remaining stoic and detached all the time. SPOILER ALERT. That is especially true in the farewell scene between Robert and Maria. There have only been two books that have ever brought tears to my eyes and this book is one of them (the other is Cormac McCarthy's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Road\/dp\/0307387895\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Road<\/a>). The farewell scene between Robert and Maria was very sad and poignant. I had no idea Hemingway was capable of such power. He is less restrained here and it shows.\n\nThere are a number of really poignant scenes in the book. There is a scene where Robert is remembering back to his childhood when he had to get on a train and go to school for the first time. His dad is very emotional, he is crying, and he says a little prayer before Robert gets on the train. Robert is embarrassed for his father and he says it was the first time he felt older than his father. It is a very poignant and beautiful moment. There is very little of that in the other Hemingway I have read.\n\nFinally, the novel deals with some interesting themes. Like all Hemingway novels there is the theme of courage but Hemingway lets us hear the thoughts of his characters as they battle with their own fear in this book in a way that he does not in his other works. Death is also a theme as it is in nearly all Hemingway works. SPOILER ALERT. Robert Jordan expresses beautifully what is so difficult about death. Robert Jordan is an atheist. He does not believe in any afterlife, so he is not frightened by the afterlife. The reason death is difficult is because \"The world is a fine place and worth the fighting for and I hate to leave it very much\" (Robert Jordan's own words) (467). Only Hemingway could have expressed the sadness of having to say goodbye to the world and everything in it so simply and yet so powerfully. This is easily one of the most moving books I have ever read, and I never thought I would say that about a Hemingway book. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone whether you are a Hemingway fan or not.","summary":"Finally! I get Hemingway's appeal...","unixReviewTime":1378252800,"vote":null,"image":null}

This existential question certainly torments FWTBT's protagonist Robert Jordan, an American ex-patriate, Spanish professor, and bridge demolitions expert allied with several Spanish communist guerrilla fighters against the fascists in their late `30s civil war.  Robert certainly doesn't want to deal with this abstract dilemma.  An efficient, meticulous professional, he merely wants to destroy a strategic bridge in order to slow the fascist advance.  But, this task is not so cut-and-dry as it seems.  Like an unemotional surgeon, Robert has to time the explosion precisely in order to delay the fascists enough so that the main communist forces led by General Golz can arrive in time to retaliate.  This means there is plenty of idle, \"dead\" time to not only plan the demolition, but also to somewhat unwillingly get drawn into the lives, hopes, and fates of the guerrilla fighters.\n\n  And what vibrant, compelling, unforgettable characters these fighters are!  One of the most admirable fighters is the elderly but capable and loyal guerrilla veteran Anselmo who helps Robert execute the complicated demolition and attack lookout logistics.  Despite his war experience, Anselmo wrestles with qualms about killing others, since it conflicts with fading but still strong religious convictions, but he constantly convinces himself that it is for the good of \"The Republic\".  In spite of himself, Robert mirrors the same misgivings, even though he is a self-professed atheist.  An even more conflicted guerrilla veteran is the swinish but cunning Pablo, who was once a dedicated insurrectionist but may have lost his nerve because of new materialistic longings, especially for horses.  His allegiance to the cause is uncertain, especially to Robert.  There is the alluring, violated, seemingly fragile and traumatized, but nevertheless determined revolutionary Maria, with whom the surprisingly (to him) smitten Robert shares a passionate relationship.  Then there is the plump, matronly, wise, outspoken and totally indomitable amazon Pilar, wife of Pablo and fierce protector of Maria, the equal of (and probably superior to) any man.  She provides Robert comforting adages, observations, and moral support.  She has her own misgivings about war, fighting, and killing like the rest of the group, but her patriotism and the promise of a fair Republic, as well as her sturdy personality, keeps her going.\n\n  As I said, despite his best efforts to distance himself from the guerilla fighters' personal dramas and remain practical and professional, Robert finds himself drawn in.  Although FWTBT gives the lie to war's depiction as continuous, monumental action (in the novel, it is often quiet and dull with only occasional, sporadic bursts of fire and action), it seems to see the Spanish civil war as meaningful and important, unlike a lot of wars.  FWTBT hints that Robert sees this war the same way and that he wants to contribute to the communists' worthy cause of freedom and autonomy.  Not only that, it also seems he wants to perpetuate his grandfather's heroic Civil War legacy, and expunge the cowardly shame of his father's suicide.\n\n  Nevertheless, even worthy wars can demand actions that can be unconscionable in peacetime.  For example, Pablo's potential for betrayal prompts the guerrilla band and Robert to debate whether to kill Pablo.  Again, killing is supposed to be wrong,but in this case may save the lives of others.  But as counterpoint, Pilar relates the grisly tale of how Pablo, she, and several citizens of a Spanish town captured several fascists (including priests) and made them run a deadly gauntlet.  Even though it felt right and pleasurable to beat and humiliate this evil enemy, and even though they were \"losing their religion\", Pilar still felt remorse for such barbaric actions.  Not only were they barbaric, they were futile; the fascists took the town anyway.  No wonder Robert struggles to keep a clinical, impersonal perspective on this war; he fears that if he cares too much, he can't do his job effectively.\n\n  Even in his intimate relations with Maria, Robert keeps this arms-length attitude.  Make no mistake, he appreciates her company and feels she has made his life sweeter and more substantial, but he also resents the fact that it happened too late and in war time and that war could end it.  But of course Maria's mixture of unjustly tarnished innocence, her fierce devotion to him, and her staunch revolutionary parentage endears Robert to her and evokes protective feelings equal to Pilar's.  He even goes so far to say that he is \"married\" to her and one with her and describes plans on how they will live their lives together in Madrid post-war, though FWTBT is a wee bit unclear as to how sincere Robert is about all this.\n\n  As the war continues, and the bridge demolition time nears, this existential struggle plays out, most tellingly in Robert's internal monologues.  Throughout FWTBT, his admiration for the guerrilla fighters rises and falls, his opinion of the war oscillates between worthwhile and incompetently chaotic, and his will to live and fight waxes and wanes.  The chapters on the fascist's horrific besiegement of stalwart communist guerrilla fighter El Sordo, the Robert's guerrilla fighters' noble but impractical desire to help El Sordo, and guerrilla fighter Andres' resolute but probably futile efforts to get Robert's message to General Golz to delay his attack because the advancing fascists were not vulnerable enough - all this reflects Robert's vacillating thinking.\n\n  To the very end of FWTBT, Robert struggles.  Does it matter whether he blows the bridge up or not?  The fascists will come anyway.  Robert and his band must retreat, including Maria, whom he may not ever see again.  Finally, a leg injury forces Robert to make a choice between two terrible actions that might be considered dishonorable at most times.  However, in war time, either action might be seen as a noble self-sacrifice.  Whichever Robert chooses, it will finally convince him that, in at least this circumstance, life is indeed worth living, fighting, and dying for.\n\nSome observations:\n\n1. Like Hemingway's other war novel \"A Farewell to Arms\" (see my Amazon review if you are interested) FWTBT deals with the pain and the elation of war, love, and inevitable death.  I believe FWTBT is the greater novel because unlike \"A Farewell to Arms\" it finds hope where there is no hope to be found.\n\n2. The \"thees\", \"thys\", and \"thous\" in the dialogues between Robert and the guerrilla fighters sounded a bit artificial to me.  Of course, FWTBT is based upon Hemingway's experience, so I must assume the dialogue is authentic.  Still, it sounded like an Amish community.\n\n3. As in \"A Farewell to Arms\", the love interest Maria in FWTBT is decidedly compliant, obedient, and almost worshipful to her man.  Of course, the circumstances in both novels explain that most un-feminist attitude.  Still, it can sound like Hemingway's private romantic fantasy, especially with that unintentionally comic (to me) phrase, \"Did the earth move?\".\n\n4. If you haven't read FWTBT and plan to, keep a Spanish dictionary handy.  Hemingway does translate most of the Spanish phrases he uses, but not all of them.  Furthermore, be warned: many of the Spanish phrases are obscene, if amusingly so.","summary":"Is Life Worth Living, Fighting For, and Dying For?","unixReviewTime":1376438400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Buzalka","reviewText":"For Whom the Bell Tolls is Ernest Hemingway running a bit to flab. A master of constructing concentrated scenes of great power, often using dialogue alone, or with vividly rendered details sparsely catalogued, Hemingway I think starts to get lost when he begins piling up the words, and nowhere did he pile them up more than in this work, his longest ever. That's not to say that as a consequence the novel is a failure. In fact, there are many fabulous scenes in this novel, from the excruciating narration of how one village executed its fascist sympathizers and another executed its Republican mayor and his wife, to scenes where characters verbally joust while the underlying tension almost sweats from the walls. There are also vivid battle scenes where we feel the intensity experienced by the characters and another involving a sojourn across the battle lines to deliver an important message.\n\nUnfortunately, there are also a number of scenes where the dialogue spins off into desultory BS sessions to no great purpose, and extended internal monologues that feel like Hemingway never edited down his raw rough draft. Perhaps worst of all are the intimate interludes between the central character, Robert Jordan, and the heroine Maria, which to me are some of the silliest sex scenes I've ever read (\"little rabbit\"?). These scenes cartwheel into the offensive when they imply that the worst thing about the gang rape Maria experienced is that it might be a turn-off for Jordan. Frankly, I found Hemingway's vicarious need through Jordan to be the virile but sensitive manly man to the naive, submissive, sexually and psychically damaged Maria rather creepy.\n\nAs for the length of For Whom the Bell Tolls, I think it was very deliberate on Hemingway's part. When the novel was published in 1940, Hemingway was coming off a lackadaisical decade in which his only major works were a pair of rather self-indulgent nonfiction works about two of his hobbyhorses, bullfighting (Death in the Afternoon) and big game hunting (The Green Hills of Africa), and the slipshod \"novel\" To Have and Have Not, which reminded nobody that the same guy had also written The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms. True, he had also produced a number of very fine short stories (\"The Snows of Kilimanjaro,\" \"The Short Happy Life of Francis MacComber\") during this period, but Bells to me just seems like Hemingway's deliberate attempt to show that he can produce prose in volume with the best of them. But like I said, that's not playing to his strengths.\n\nOne other note I would like to mention is Hemingway's take on the internal politics of the Spanish Republican side, which were dysfunctional to say the least. He seems remarkably sanguine about Soviet influence, which seems very naive compared with the much more measured view taken by George Orwell in Homage to Catalonia. Of course, by the time For Whom the Bell Tolls was published, in late 1940, the verdict was in in Spain (the \"good guys\" lost) and the fascists (Germany and Italy) and the Communists (the Soviet Union) had gone on to other predations.\n\nI'm sorry for dwelling more on the faults than the virtues of this book in this review. I really did enjoy reading it again, but I figured the virtues were already well documented by the many five-star reviews here, so I thought I'd give my thoughts on things that haven't been mentioned as much but which I think are important to keep in mind when reading For Whom the Bell Tolls.","summary":"Hemingway's prose begins to grow a spare tire","unixReviewTime":1376265600,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

But at least I won't resort to name calling like some reviewers do, when someone doesn't share their opinion.  If you've never read it, give it a try, you may love it.  If you don't, its not indicative of your intelligence level as some would have us believe.","summary":"You love it or you hate it","unixReviewTime":1373328000,"vote":null,"image":null}

The entire novel takes place over 72 hours in which Robert Jordon, the young American, is responsible, as part of a bigger attack, to bomb a bridge and by that ensure that the Fascists won't be able to send reinforcements after the attack has begun. During those intense 72 hours, Robert Jordon falls in love with Maria, a Spanish girl whose family was murdered by the Fascists. (Isn't it amazing how Hemingway's characters always manage to fall in love faster than it takes one to finish smoking a cigarette?) The story follows Robert Jordon's preparations for the attack and his relationship with Maria and the guerrilla fighters who will assist him with the attack.\n\nI am fairly puzzled by this novel, which is considered by many to be Hemingway's best. It offers brilliant observations into the mind of his solider and the psychological aspects of participating in war and how Jordon copes with the hardships of it. While reading some parts of this novel, I was fully absorbed and captivated. In others, I felt it was rather long-winded. Perhaps some editing would have been handy. Although I don't think it is Hemingway's best, I do recommend it to Hemingway's fans.","summary":"Not my favorite Hemingway","unixReviewTime":1372982400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Scott","reviewText":"Controversy has swirled around Ernest Hemingway's masterpiece since the day it was published. \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in 1941 and the Pulitzer committee agreed unanimously to name the book as the winner of the fiction category. Board president Nicholas Murray Butler, however, overruled the committee on the grounds that he felt the book to be profane and offensive. No award in the fiction category was given that year. The Pulitzer committee, sans Butler, did go on to award Hemingway in 1953 for \"The Old Man and the Sea.\" Butler has since been widely criticized for his partisan politics and racial beliefs during his 43 year stint as president of Columbia University. Hemingway also won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954.\n\n\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" is Ernest Hemingway's seminal novel of the Spanish Civil War. Beginning in 1937 Hemingway traveled to Spain to cover the war as a reporter. In the years before WWII, Spanish Republicans, backing the established Spanish Republic fought the fascist Nationalist forces of General Francisco Franco. The Republicans received backing from the Soviet Union and various organizations of the Marxist movement, among others. The rising forces of Nazi Germany and Italy backed Franco. The fascists under Franco won. Franco established a dictatorship and then went on to rule Spain with an iron hand until his death in 1975.\n\nIt is easy to get hung up on all the politics involved in this book - who is backing which side, etc. Remember the time frame of the book (pre-WWII) and know that the story is essentially human. It is about ideals, loyalty, love, sacrifice, and honor in the face of loss and death. Robert Jordan is an American who joins the guerrillas fighting on the side of the republic as a dynamiter. Jordan's goal is to blow a key bridge right after a Republican attack starts against the Fascists. He meets up with the anti-Fascist cell in the area, which is headquartered in a well-hidden cave. Pilar is the wife of Pablo, who ostensibly is in charge, but Pilar runs the show. Pablo is tired, burned out, and dangerous to the cause after years of war and atrocities committed on both sides, and Pilar takes the reins. While coordinating the attack with the cell Robert Jordan meets and falls in love with Maria, a young woman adopted by the cell after her family is decimated by the fascists and she is raped by their soldiers. Much like the principal characters in \"A Farewell to Arms,\" the wartime romance is accelerated and Jordan undergoes a transformation due to his love for Maria. He begins to question his role in an increasingly futile conflict. He spiritually takes Maria for his wife with hopes and dreams for the future. When it becomes evident that the guerrilla attack will be doomed, Jordan must decide between escaping with Maria or staying true to his ideals and do his duty with honor in the face of impending disaster. The entire story takes place in four days.\n\nI really liked \"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\" It gets beyond the politics and the ideologies and more into the nature of war, showing that there is good and bad on both sides of any conflict. Hemingway points out that the best soldiers don't necessarily win a war - the ones with the biggest weapons do. \"To make war all you need is intelligence. But to win you need talent and material.\" Other memorable gems from the text include, \"Nothing is done to oneself that one does not accept,\" and \"If you stop complaining and asking for what you never will get, you will have a good life. A good life is not measured by any biblical span.\" The apt title itself comes from the John Donne quote, \"...And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.\" Thus is the nature of any conflict, regardless of the politics involved.  One reason Jordan, an American, is fighting in Spain is because he is concerned with the rise of bigotry and fascism in his own country. This belief is made all the more ironic by the treatment of the book by the Pulitzer committee and Nicholas Murray Butler in 1941, on the very eve of America's entry into WWII against Nazi Germany.\n\nDo not be intimidated by \"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\" On the surface it reads like a great adventure story with compelling characters. It is so much more than that, however. As with the very best of novels, its themes and messages are truly timeless, ringing true during the Spanish Civil War, WWII, Vietnam, and today. This is an excellent book, and I recommend it very highly.","summary":"The Book That Ripped the Pulitzer Apart","unixReviewTime":1369353600,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

How can I add to the other 390 people who have read \"The Old Man And The Sea\"? How would you like to read Ernest Hemingway's own words? Hemingway gives us a rare opportunity to understand the nature of his writing in the book, \"Ernest Hemingway on Writing\". I am sure that Hemingway did not intend his private letters to become public but this reader is thankful. \"The Old Man And The Sea\" places the reader in the moment because of Hemingway's intent. Listen to his words about story: \"Make the story so real beyond any reality that it will become a part of the readers experience\". Listen to what Hemingway says about place: \"Convey Everything, every sensation, sight, feeling, place, and emotion to the reader.\" Listen to his belief in character: \" I want them to sound as though they really happened.\" \"The Old Man and The Sea\" is only 127 pages but conveys a old fisherman's entire world: \"Prose should read easy and simply and seem short and yet have all the dimensions of the visible world and the world of a mans spirit.\" Hemingway pulls us into the story by his detailed description of the old mans boat; \"The sail was patched with flour sacks and furled it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.\" Many months have passed since the old man has proven his skill while other; \"successful fisherman of that day were already in and had butchered the marlin out and carried them laid out full length across two planks with two men staggering at the end of each plank.\" Everything in the olds mans life began to lack purpose and fiction filled in the gaps; \"There was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it. But they went through this fiction every day. There was no pot of rice and fish and the boy knew that too.\" On land the old man was just an old man but in his boat he was transformed; \"They were strange shoulders still powerful although very old and the neck was still strong too and the creases did not show so much.\" The sea gave him hope; \"The old man always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave great favours and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them.\" The great fish lived in a world unknown to most except the old man; \"Nothing showed on the surface of the water but some patches of yellow sun-bleached Sargasso weed and the purple formalized iridescent gelatinous bladder of a Portuguese man-of-war floating close beside the boat.\" Death of the great fish was near and; \"He was bright in the sun and his head and back were dark purple and in the sun the stripes on his sides showed wide and light lavender.\" If you love the spoken word and want to be transported into the world of an old man and a great fish, \"The Old Man And The Sea\" is a must-read.

The 1968 copyrighted special edition was part of the Limited Edition and I believe Famous Editions. I consider it to be the best of the available editions as the rest are rather generic covers designed for an Ernest Hemingway series.\n\nThis edition contains illustrations and an introduction by Sinclair Lewis.\n\nThis was my introduction to Hemingway, and perhaps not the best book to be weaned on. I can understand why kids hate him. His writing is \"real time.\" Characters are developed at a snails pace through conversation and deeds. Hemingway seems to write about every waking hour of the main character Robert Jordon. Jordon is an American helping the Spanish in their fight against fascism. The Abraham Lincoln Brigade was a famous group of American communists and various left wingers who went to the aid of the Spanish people. Their experience proved invaluable as they were recruited to act as spies for the OSS during WWII. After WWII, for their dedicated service they were barred from the CIA because they were communists.\n\nThis story likewise looks at patriotism, communism, democracy, and fascism seen at the microcosm level of Robert Jordan. It is a tale about love and loyalty as Robert meets Maria and plans to make her an honest woman when it is all over. The beginning of the book opens with plans to blow up a strategic bridge, which happens about 400 pages later. The action is slow. Hemingway writing shifts between first and third person. He has sentences without verbs. The book is lengthy and needs an editor by today's standards.\n\nI don't know if this is how Hemingway wrote the book, but in this edition it uses the phrase \"curse word\" when a curse word should be used. It got annoying after a while. Meanwhile this edition includes an illustration of a topless woman.\n\nThis is a fine looking EP edition to put on your shelf.

I can only add my voice to those praising the wonderful cadence of Hemingway's dialogue and the haunting, descriptive narrative as he works through how the politics of war have changed all his characters, reducing them to little more than animals living in caves, sometimes predators and sometimes prey.\n\nHemingway was sympathetic in real life to the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War (against the Fascists), but he does not completely spare them in his portrayal of the levels of brutality to which men stoop in a war pitting citizens of a single country against each other.  Hemingway also spares little sympathy on the ignorance and stupidity of some in command of the Republican Army, nor the callousness of those on the elite periphery, as preparations are made for the novel's pivotal moment.\n\nThe narrative in the audio version is by Campbell Scott.  He is a very soft spoken performer who took some getting used to.  I imagined this novel would be read in a more forceful way, more like I imagined Hemingway himself might have read it, but Mr. Scott's voice is very measured and while heroic, virile male characters like the republican guerrilla fighters, characters like Pablo and El Sordo, may have been slightly underplayed, his careful narration allowed him to give depth to female characters, especially Pilar.\n\nI have listened to many audiobooks and one of the most annoying things can be male narrators trying to do female characters and completely blowing it.  A failure on this level can take you right out of the story and completely ruin the experience of listening to the book.\n\nMr. Scott avoids this and is able to voice the female characters without it sounding like a parody.  This is incredibly important with this book because the female characters are prominent and very strong. Another problem some narrators encounter is accents; again, a failure here ruins the book.  Mr. Scott never overplays any of the characters, giving each one of them credible distinctions without ever descending in stereotype.\n\nWhen I had finished listening to the book I realized that Mr. Scott, by achieving this balance with supporting characters, had given nearly perfect voice to the measured, methodical and logical voice of American Robert Jordon, the main character.  Since much of the book is introspective reflection and dialogue by Jordon, Mr. Scott's narrative style was, for me, the perfect fit.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend both this book and this audio version.  If you are not a reader or don't see yourself ever being able to attack this long book, try the audio version.  You will be carried away to the treacherous gray, stony mountains north of Madrid by an author who knew not only how to live but also how to die.","summary":"For Whom The Bell Tolls - Audio Review","unixReviewTime":1349395200,"vote":null,"image":null}

It even has some pleasant moments.  But ultimately, it's about the selfless nature of war---which, though Hemingway clearly intends us to admire the acts of sacrifice to which the war incites his characters, I think is the greatest condemnation of war.\n\nBut Hemingway's portrayal of this theme is quite powerful.  He isn't always consistent, but he is about as consistent as it is possible to be about such a theme and much more so than most, which is of great artistic value.\n\nIt's also generally very well written, much more so than (and something of a relief after reading) a lot of faux-Hemingway like John Steinbeck or Cormac McCarthy.  And I thought this was much better than the only other Hemingway I've read, A Farewell to Arms.  But there are a few passages that miss the mark, such as this almost comically bad sex scene: \"...They were having now and before and always and now and now and now. Oh, now, now, now, the only now, and above all now, and there is no other now but thou now and now is thy prophet. Now and forever now. Come now, now, for there is no now but now. Yes, now. Now, please now, only now, not anything else only this now, and where are you and where am I and where is the other one, and not why, not ever why, only this now; and on and always please then always now, always now, for now always one now; one only one, there is no other one but one now, one, going now, rising now, sailing now, leaving now, wheeling now, soaring now, away now, all the way now, all of all the way now; one and one is one, is one, is one, is one, is still one, is still one, is one descendingly, is one softly, is one longingly, is one kindly, is one happily, is one in goodness, is one to cherish, is one now...\" blah blah blah.\n\nThe mind-numbing repetitiousness of this \"description\" (if one can call it that) is especially unfortunate as it echoes another passage just a few pages earlier which is intended to have quite a different feel: \"...muck this whole treacherous muckfaced mucking country and every mucking Spaniard in it on either side and to hell forever. Muck them to hell together, Largo, Prieto, Asensio, Miaja, Rojo, all of them. Muck every one of them to death to hell. Muck the whole treachery-ridden country. Muck their egotism and their selfishness and their selfishness and their egotism and their conceit and their treachery. Muck them to hell and always. Muck them before we die for them. Muck them after we die for them. Muck them to death and hell...\"  It goes on like this at some length.\n\nBut in the end, Hemingway affirms that there are \"pleasant things to speak of\": \"That is in Madrid. Just over the hills there, and down across the plain. Down out of the gray rocks and the pines, the heather and the gorse, across the yellow high plateau you see it rising white and beautiful. That part is just as true as Pilar's old women drinking the blood down at the slaughterhouse. There's no one thing that's true. It's all true. The way the planes are beautiful whether they are ours or theirs.\"  But the horrors win out in the end: \"The hell they are, he thought.\"\n\nThree and a half stars.","summary":"War and self-sacrifice","unixReviewTime":1344470400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Skwiat","reviewText":"The decades since Hemingway's death have not been kind to his legacy. While still revered as a pillar of English literature, his life seems to have chipped away at his work.  Most find Hemingway's writing too dry or his stories clustered with masogny and booze. To be fair the critiques have some relevance, but behind every Hemingway story lies a heart fractured, but aspiring for peace. For Whom the bell Tolls was my fourth Hemingway and I can honestly say my favorite. There is so much to marvel at that my meager attempts at a review do the book no justice, but it's the way Hemingway writes and the subtle beauty that he evokes that made this novel so enjoyable for me.  Hemingway's prose style is so intricate it at once appears etched in stone, but  light as a feather.  Hemingway shows how war not only changes the way we feel and act, but the bonds we form with the ones around us.  Robert Jordan's relationship with Maria is one of the few hemingway's love stories that I felt connected to, and while a bit dated in today's world I still was touched by the love they bore one another.  Maria is encapsulated in a blanket of femine weakness, but she is bolstered by the mighty Pilar.  I find Pilar to be one of hemingway's most fascinating women. Endless papers can be written on her alone, and I found her to be so multifaceted.  Besides being one of hemingway's best novels, it's also one of his longest.  At first I was daunted by 400 pages of dry Hemingway prose, but by the end I was looking for more.  Besides shining light on an area of world history few even know existed(the Spanish Civil War), Hemingway's story is universal in it's telling by including themes of fraternity, nationalism, and the multifaceted definitions of courage.  I have a new respect and love for Hemingway after reading this remarkable novel.  While Hemingway may not be everyones cup of tea, but those looking for a good and memorable story should look no further!","summary":"The real heart of Hemingway","unixReviewTime":1343433600,"vote":null,"image":null}

It has three major flaws:\n\n1. The hero's love interest, Maria, is a uninteresting and unattractive. Most of the other characters feel like flesh-and-blood, flawed people, but, for reasons I can't fathom, the author gave Maria the psychological depth of a pet.\n2. The hero's dialogs with Spaniards are in a distracting and ridiculous form, resulting in lines like \"Eatest thou always onions for breakfast?\"\n3. The characters' swearing is clumsily bleeped out, with lines like \"Obscenity thy mother!\" At first, I thought  that the Kindle edition I was reading had been censored, and returned it. I switched to Scribner's 1968 print edition, and found the same. I cannot believe that Hemingway actually wrote that way.\n\nAnother strange passage that is also dating the book is one where the hero views himself as \"taking part in a crusade,\" adding \"That was the only word for it although it was a word that had been so worn and abused that it no longer gave its true meaning.\" And what exactly is the true meaning of \"crusade\"?

What I fell in love with in his writing is all here, except his conciseness. This story could have been 200 pages shorter and all the better for it. But Hemingway was responding to critics that accused him of the very conciseness that made his other works a rhythmic masterpiece of storytelling narrative. Hemingway understood technique better than any writer, and why he let criticism overrule better judgment destroys the pace and rhythmic flow of this story. For a three day period, 470 pages is a lot of cave dwelling, talking, eating and drinking. The stories of Pilar while important also drag the story in pacing. Robert Jordan's train of thought - well let's just say that is a mighty long train. The relationship between Jordan and Maria is a quick and welcome breath of distraction from the mundane cave proceedings.\nThis is still worthy of a read, but you are going to have to spend some time with it and, dare say, slug through some excessive chapters where the rhythm and flow of the story comes to a crawl.","summary":"Broken Rhythm Hampers An Otherwise Brilliant Novel","unixReviewTime":1341619200,"vote":null,"image":null}

The story takes place over three days but the book runs in excess of four hundred pages.  As a result, the pace can get slow at times.  No background is given on the war, but Hemingway's sympathies are clear: the fascists must be defeated, and the worth of personal sacrifices is determined in how they further the greater good.  Hemingway develops some interesting characters, particularly \"Pablo,\" a disillusioned partisan leader whose murderous actions in support of a noble cause lead him to alcoholism and defeatism.  The American protagonist is most interesting: a cynic who still believes in a cause outside himself.  The romantic relationship between the American and a Spanish girl was not the novel's strength; Hemingway did not make his career drafting love stories.  Although a bit slow, some of the scenes are fantastic.  In particular, the flashback to the murder of fascist sympathizers in a small village is one of the most horrifying chapters I have ever read.  Likewise, an account of a partisan group's last stand on a hilltop puts most Hollywood action movies to shame.  Liked the book but did not love it.

So that qualifies as literature according to my wife's definition when I asked her what made literature \"literature\" a while ago.\n\nProtagonist Robert Jordan is an American volunteering with the Republicans fighting Franco's Fascists in the Spanish Civil War.  A demolitions expert, Jordan's task is to blow a key bridge as part of a larger Republican attack.  While waiting with a small band of guerilla's he meets and falls in love with Maria, a victim of the war and symbol for all innocents caught in aggression's path.\n\nThus we have a literary work that addresses commitment to cause, love, and the battle between individual wants and the needs of and obligations to a larger cause.\n\nHemmingway has a way with description and his prose is very well done and evocative - particularly one passage I liked when he described holding Maria's hand with ripening grain in an untrammeled field.  His story is slow, however, for my tastes and the descriptions and inner conversations of Jordan are much more prevalent than scenes where anything called action could be said to be occurring (though the action scenes are pretty good when they do occur).  I imagine the ending will be unsatisfying to some, but for literary minded folks be the source of discussion as to how the final scene may have played out and what it meant in terms of tying the story's themes together.","summary":"For Whom The Bell Tolls","unixReviewTime":1334275200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Among the gurerillas is a young woman, Maria, who becomes attracted to him.\n\nA man named Pablo appears to be in charge. However, it is his wife, Pilar, who is the real force behind the group.

This mixture of love and war is a significant juxtaposition used by the author. With the tender moments of these two characters, it is as if this might be what the guerrilas are fighting for. The government's totalarianism attitude cannot tell them what to do and that gypsies like Rafael, foreigners like Robert, women like Pilar and Marie can all work and live together as equals.\n\nHemingway has a master's givt for dialogue. We don't just read the words but are transported to the Spanish mountainside and are listening to the scenes such as Pilar and Pablo discussing a matador that Pable had seen and admired. It is so real that we can almost hear the crowd chant ole'.\n\nHemindway was a reporter in Spain during the Civil War and his characters are honest in their actions loyal to one another and  Spain and are described in great detail.\n\nThe story mixes historical fact and speculative fiction in a most entertaining manner. Readers will enjoy the novel and feel as though they have read a work of extroadinary literary significance.","summary":"\"Every time you hear a bell ring, it means some angel's just got his wings.\" Francis Goodrich","unixReviewTime":1320969600,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

This is a book about death and dying set against the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War.\nHemingway's novels and stories present a certain kind of hero: \"The Code Hero.\" This individual lives by his own code and struggles gracefully and bravely against death and annihilation. Another consistent theme found in Hemingway is courage under fire or dire circumstances, whether it is in the bull ring, behind enemy lines, or hunting man-eaters in the green hills of Africa. Cowardice is particularly loathed.\nThe novel begins in 1937 at the height of the Spanish Civil War and takes place over a four day period.  The chief protagonist is an American named Robert Jordon who has been tasked to blow up a bridge behind enemy lines in the Spanish mountains. He is aided in this task by a band of guerrillas headed by Pablo and the woman of Pablo, Pilar. We also meet the beautiful Maria. A young Spanish girl whose parents were murdered by Fascists soldiers who then raped and abused Maria. Some say that Maria represents Spain and her gang rape represent the despoilage of Spain by the Fascists.\nRobert and Maria fall in love at first sight. This is another recurring theme to be found in Hemingway, that humans can find salvation through romantic love. The couple makes love together in Jordon's sleeping bag on the ground outside the mouth of the cave where they are all hiding.  He asks Maria \"Did the earth move for thee?\" This is the earliest I have seen this terminology in print and is now considered a clich, but it may be that Hemingway coined this usage.\nHemingway's use of language was controversial in this novel. Many Spanish words and phrases were translated literally word for word which gave a sense of the Spanish but sounds archaic and stilted to our English hearing ears. For example, the Spanish characters in the novel referred to each other as thee and thou. The traditional second person singular in English is \"thou\/thee\/thy\". The most exact way of translating \"tu\" from Spanish is \"thou\" or \"thee\". This was a bold experiment. Once the convention was understood and accepted one got used to and even grew to like it.\nDuring the course of the novel many flashbacks and digressions take place as various characters tell their stories and reminiscence about the past. We learn, for example, that Jordon's Grandfather was a Civil War hero in the America's war of rebellion. We also learned that his father was a coward and that he shot himself to death with a pistol. It is indeed ironic that Hemingway's own father committed suicide and that Hemingway took his own life with a shot gun many years later.\nDeath is the primary focus of the novel with much discussion amongst the characters about what it is like to kill another human being, was it the right thing to do and what would it be like to die.  In the end, Jordon is fatally wounded after successfully completing his mission and trying to escape. He waits by the roadside while the others get away, hoping to kill as many of the enemy soldiers as he can before he dies.\nIt took me a long time to get around to reading this book. I have been carrying it around with me since 1971. I finally read it in 2011. Forty years. It was well worth the wait. While each man's death may diminish me to some extent, this novel has made me whole.","summary":"For Whom The Bell Tolls","unixReviewTime":1319846400,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

Others have called this work simplistic, its title unrelated to the book's content, something to be idolized by high school English teachers. Ha! If you read only to be entertained, you will miss some of the most poignant features of the work.\n\nFor me, the characters come alive in the book. They live and breathe as human beings most certainly did during the Spanish Revolution: Golz, Anselmo, El Sordo, Pablo, and Pilar. And although Robert Jordan's intimacy with Maria is cloaked in euphemisms to get it past the censors when the book was first written in 1939, I got the point: the two of them, as sometimes happens once or twice in life, were inexplicably drawn to each other. It's not something carnal or obscene; it's something divine, and that which one should be eternally thankful for. Certainly, Hemingway must have realized this when he created the characters of Robert and Maria.\n\nThe ending was written some thirty-eight times in an attempt \"to get the words right,\" and that speaks volumes about the author's diligence in producing a work of literature that will last the ages. The love which Robert Jordan had for Maria is evidenced in his desire to see her safely away, to give up his life that she may move on and live her life. He knows he is \"mucked,\" yet he kindly but forcibly tells Maria they will always be together. Now, that's love!\n\nI give this work my highest rating.","summary":"The Ultimate Sacrifice","unixReviewTime":1315094400,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

In this way Hemingway demonstrates his genius for having accurate and sensitive insight into the human spirit.\n\nI am impressed by the way he is able to express passion, especially in the sex scenes, under the constraints of early 20th century censorship.  I read this book simultaneously with Sandra Brown's \"Hello Darkness,\" reading six chapters of Hemingway to every five chapters of Brown so that I would finish both books at the same time.  This truly provided a contrast of how human passions were expressed in early 20th century novels compared with how they are expressed today.  You should try it!  It's an eye-opener!  What some would judge as repetitive prose in Hemingway was actually a literary device he used to bring the reader into the experience, and in my opinion (and of course, the opinions of countless other readers and critics) Hemingway succeeds famously. I also found it very amusing to read how Hemingway skirted around the expression of \"unprintable\" language, a hindrance contemporary authors no longer need to be concerned about <g>\n\nAnother device Hemingway uses in this novel is to make his characters \"think\" in Spanish but \"speak\" in English.  This is not easy to accomplish successfully.  Because I am bi-lingual, I found the rhythm of the prose quite natural, but I wonder how the experience would be for an only-English speaking reader.\n\nThis is my second Hemingway novel and I am so grateful that I have been introduced to Hemingway on Kindle. Because I read this on Kindle for PC, I was able to conveniently and quickly look up not only the definitions of words I did not know but also the translations of Spanish phrases with which I was unfamiliar.  Thank you, Kindle!  It made reading this book much more interesting and informative.  It has also spurred an interest in the history of the Spanish Revolution which took place in the decade before I was born.  Of course, Kindle has satisfied that curiosity as well.\n\nThis is more than a worthwhile read for anyone who enjoys war novels.  One learns so much from reading; I've always said fiction is the best medium for speaking truth, and Truth (whatever that means to each one individually) abounds in this book.

Hemingway tries to create Spanish sounding English by stretching the syntax of English nearly to its breaking point, by rendering Spanish-ism into odd English phrases, like \"what passes with thee?\" for que pasa, a common Spanish greeting.\n\nHemingway also uses archaic English usages to present forms that exist in Spanish, but are gone from English, like thee and thou for the second person pronoun. It makes for strange but captivating reading. Here is a writer rendering English into Spanish forms. The results are startling and not always enjoyable; but it always gives you the impression that you have entered another world.\n\nIf the novel was written in more fluid English, the result would not have been so unusual. The very clumsiness of the language reminds the reader that this is a novel that is taking place in another, somewhat more formal language. And the English bears that imprint.\n\nWhen we read For Whom the Bell Tolls we can see English both reaching into its past to create diction of current usage, as well as using an odd and foreign syntax to give the illusion of another language.  Often, this effect was criticized.  But an open reading of this novel shows what an effective technique this is and how well it does the heavy lifting of expressing another culture's values on the level of language from one tongue to another.","summary":"Rendering one language into another","unixReviewTime":1289347200,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

This was a well written, easy to read book. My edition was 470 pages, and I had it read in 2 days. The story sucks you in pretty well. I even was able to tolerate the romantic parts, and there are lots of them when Robert Jordan falls in love with the young lady Maria. Usually I roll my eyes and skip past the slop, but this was not too bad. The ending at the bridge was extremely well done. When I read about Robert Jordan down there planting his explosives, near panic because he still hears shooting up above, trying to calm himself down, it really did make my own heart beat a little faster. No book has done that to me in a very long time.\nSo here's what I didn't like. First, it seems like two-thirds of the book was a buildup to the attack on the bridge. After a while, I was thinking, get on with it, already. The big one, however, that ruined the book for me, was the last few pages. Robert Jordan blew up the bridge, reunited with what was left of his group, reunited with Maria, and was fleeing, when a tank shell knocked him off his horse and the horse collapsed on top of him, breaking his leg. Now, in this part, Maria is absolutely right. She wants to cut the load off one of the horses and throw Robert Jordan on its back. Sure, his leg was broken.. so what? That's a non-fatal wound. He wasn't losing any blood as far as I could tell from the text. Sure, he probably would have lost his leg, but so what? Better than losing his life. I really hate what he does here. He gives up. He drives Maria away, breaking her heart for life. Then he lies there with a gun, waiting for the enemy so he can go out in a blaze of glory.\nMaybe Hemingway meant for this to be noble and heroic. Not for me. To me, it was stupid, unnecessary, and downright cowardly. You see, I'm not suicidal, and I can't get past the fact that this joker did not have a fatal injury. He could have lived and escaped. He had done his bit for the cause in blowing up the bridge. He had a woman (Maria) who loved him and was willing to marry him. He had a good, secure job waiting for him back in the States. The only downside for him is that he may have lost one leg. Big deal. To me, in throwing all that away and committing suicide, Robert Jordan ended up a despicable coward. His little suicidal ending may have killed one enemy officer. A suicidal ending like his is appropriate if you are inches from death; better to take one of them with you on the way out. But Robert Jordan was NOT near death! He just had a busted leg. So he's an idiot, and did not deserve Maria's love. The only possible benefit I can see is that maybe, IF he managed to kill that enemy officer, it allowed the group with Maria a little more time to get away. But they were all behind enemy lines anyway, so I'm not sure how much that matters.\nSo, to sum it all up, I really enjoyed this book up to the last few pages. I was so let down by that ending that I took a star off, and I give it 4 out of 5.","summary":"Very good except for the very end of the book","unixReviewTime":1289260800,"vote":null,"image":null}

That's the basic plot. It sounds like something out a an action movie, doesn't it. To stop there, however, would be doing the novel and the author a grave disservice.\n\nWhen it gets down to it, For Whom the Bell Tolls is about death and how to face it. The men on this secret bridge-exploding mission are going to die, and they know it. They will not be coming back from this mission. Each of them will be facing death one way or another, and they each have to deal with it individually. The idea of suicide is even approached from a soldier's point of view; the question is raised, is it preferable to kill oneself than to be captured by the enemy?\n\nFor Whom the Bell Tolls also touches upon racism and politics, though not strictly from an American point of view.\n\nWithin this tale, violence is to be found in spades, but this is not a simple action story. This is true literature, told in the best writing Hemingway ever did (yes, I admit that's arguable, but it's my opinion ... believe what you want).\n\nAs a writer, is there anything not to learn from Hemingway? The man knew how to write tense scenes and deal with weighty subject matters all while using as few words as possible, and most of those short words. No other author in my experience has quite been able to do that.\n\nAs an aside, I'll admit that every time I read a Hemingway novel, I always hate it. Until I reach the very last page.

I kept confusing it with Hemingway's \"A Farewell to Arms.\"\n\nI read this book because The Hubble and I came up with an agreement that we would select a book for one another every other month. We started in May. The book he selected for me was this one.\n\nI approached this book assuming I would hate it. I assumed it was just some war story (The Hubble loves those) and it would be a \"man\" book. My assumptions were partially correct. This was a story about war...but it was also so much more than that.\n\nThis was the story of Robert Jordan, the dynamiter. Robert Jordan is an American teacher who was called to Active Duty in the military. He was sent to the mountains of Spain to assist the antifascist guerilla units there. His main purpose is to demolish a bridge and assist in the attack against the fascist elements in that area.\nDuring his time with the guerilla group, Jordan begins to know and understand the many individuals who are engaged in the antifascist cause. Jordan quickly comes to care for individuals such as Anselmo, the old man, who is a hunter and hates to kill men. Pilar. the mujer de Pablo, who is considered barbarous. El Sordo...what is there to say about El Sordo? A brave man. A Strong man. A man who fought with everything he had. And Maria...Maria, the cropped headed one....\n\nI was extremely surprised to discover the love story within this book. Jordan's love affair with Maria is an integral part of this story and far from the \"man\" book I originally believed it to be. The love that Maria and her Ingles, or Roberto, share moved the Earth. It is a love that will linger in my heart.\n\nThis book is both heartbreaking and beautiful. Though it is not a \"man\" book, neither is it a \"romance.\" This is a book that will dig within the depths of any reader's soul, rip your heart out and replace it with the warm of each character held within these pages.\n\nHemingway has an amazing way with words. He is such an eloquent writer that he draws you in and makes you feel as though you were there in the hills with these people. One passage in particular stands out to me. The scene culminates in a bombing and the description of the ground rolling underneath the character is so intense and so vivid that you believe the ground has rolled under you as well.\n\nHemingway's voice is astounding. His writing style is...what can you say? How can you adequately put into words how much a book has touched you? Affected you? Engaged you? Does the thesaurus contain words and descriptions strong enough? Bold enough to give justice to the magnitude of feelings and emotions this book evoked within me? Still days after I closed the back flap over the last page...if I think about it too much I'm right back there. Right back in the mountains. On that hilltop. Waiting.\n\nNow, I couldn't remember the name of this book when I first started reading it. However, now I don't believe I will ever forget the title of this stunningly magnificent novel.

Spain is Hemingway's love.  During this time, most loved Paris - like friend Fitzgerald,.  But, dry heat and bull running mania were for  for this man.\n\nSpanish sayings abound in this novel about simple people asked to do a job - perhaps simple - in the name of the cause: blow up a bridge.  But, the pithy and poignant statements of implyingly illiterate gypsy Pilar cannot be matched by 17th century philosophers. For example Spain, in her words, is \"where blasphemy keeps pace with the austerity of religion.\"\n\nWhen protagonist Robert Jordan speaks English for a short time to some of the group, Pilar tells him to revert to Spanish as \"no language is truer.\"  She later concludes that \"Spanish is shorter and simpler.\"\n\nAnd, Hemingway's influence on this language shows as some verbs are paradoxically used -- each time the root of Spanish for English usage.  One example is to constantly implement Spanish molestar in English sentences to ask that people stop molesting one another, when the translation is not to bother one another.\n\nBut, these linguistic nuances are the special effect, the unique style, the cutting edge to the Nobel winning writing style of Hemingway.  It is the sentences of Spanglish or otherwise, compounded with his ever seemless simplification, that make this novel resound.\n\nI enjoyed this novel also for its slow beginning and its heightening to a crescendo for its  ending.  His language and other writing angles seem to mature as the novel progresses.  He slowly captures the reader, and has you under his exclusive control the last third of the book.\n\nAlthough Hemingway makes this a love story at a time of war, parts are seemingly unreal.  Knowing that he is going to die the next day, Robert Jordan meets one last time with beautiful Maria.  And, as they are about to start doing the deed, he stops and asks if she hurts.  I am sure that you can interview many a disagreeing  soldier under similar circumstances and ask if the concept of pain to the sexual partner ever entered their mind when they were having what would perhaps be their last moment of heaven on this man's earth - they would all agree that this was not exactly what they had in mind\n\nBut, this is a classic and worthy of reading.  I waited over 40 years between readings and received very different messages. Each time good.","summary":"Great Novel Read Forty Years Apart [30][68]","unixReviewTime":1259884800,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

This historical fiction from Hemingway is in my opinion far better than the other two Hemingway novels that I have read (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Sun-Also-Rises\/dp\/0743297334\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Sun Also Rises<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/A-Farewell-To-Arms\/dp\/0684801469\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">A Farewell To Arms<\/a>), and for the first time triggers the same kind of admiration for Hemingway from me that I had always been so puzzled to see from others.  If you're looking for a taste of Hemingway, this is the book I would recommend.  If you've read other Hemingway and been less than impressed, try this one before you give up on him completely.\n\nThis long book takes place over just a few days, and follows Robert Jordan as he works behind enemy lines during the Spanish Civil War.  While containing plenty of suspense and action, the primary focus of this book is delving into the psyches of Jordan and the irregulars he recruits for his mission.  A stark and honest look into the minds of simple people caught up in the sweeping events of a large war is something Hemingway excels at, and it really shows in this book.  While at times being perhaps a bit over the top with the rambling and inane thought processes of his characters, he seemed to ease up on it a bit with this story, instead focusing more on what was relevant and on progressing the story.  And personally, I liked Hemingway's use of Spanish and the literal translation during much of the dialogue.  Rather than being distracting, I felt that this method helped highlight the romantic nature of the Spanish language (and simultaneously reminded me of some of the basic Spanish that I had forgotten).\n\nThe characters in this book are also great.  Robert Jordan, Maria, Pilar, Pablo, and Anselmo are particularly well-done and unforgettable.  Unlike other reviewers, I enjoyed the innocence and sweetness of Maria, and didn't find her to be unrealistic in either her response to mistreatment or her love for Jordan.  (Is it that she fell in love so easily? that she is so blindingly trustful? that she is universally kind? or that she manages to not wallow in self-pity, that modern day feminists hate about this character?)  Pilar and Pablo are both spectacularly done, being often hilarious and always intensely complicated.  Giving faces to these and the other irregulars in this book helps the reader realize the impact on Individuals that wars can have.\n\nAs a historical fiction, this book is excellent.  You'll want to educate yourself more about the time and the circumstances around the Spanish Civil War while reading this book.  Interestingly, Hemingway himself was somewhat involved in this war, acting as a journalist, but also supposedly supporting the Republic's fight, even going so far as to help train young men in the use of modern rifles.  The content of the story comes off as being very possible, and the battles alluded to come out of real history.  Indeed, even some of the peripheral characters are historical figures, including the well-described Andr Marty (known as the Butcher of Albacete) that played a significant role toward the end of the book.  Nicely grounded in historical fact, it makes the reading of this book all that much better.\n\nVery highly recommended!!","summary":"A historical fiction masterpiece.

It is a fantastic thriller,a close account of the Spanish war and culture,of love, of death,of political stupidities....\n  But for me,this is the book that finally tuned me into Hemingways style and power-his laconic but highly descriptive prose that press all the right buttons in the imagination;the use of 'Thee' and 'Thou' to properly give the feel of the peasants dialect;the way he builds up complex characters with just the briefest of story lines,even the way Robert Jordan is always refered to as Robert Jordan seems to add to his character. Its wonderful and each chapter excites and adds.\n  When I was about 11 or 12 I foolishly tried to take on 'Farewell to Arms' and simply didn't have the reading ability then to take aboard Hemingways style (although I see now how many imitators it has) This prejudiced me against him. I didn't go overboard with the 'easier' 'Old Man and the Sea' but warmed a bit after reading 'Men Without Women' and thought I'd give Hemingway another go some time and am so glad I did with this one.\n  The complexities of this book are reflected in Hemingways own life;the preoccupation with death and suicide,of beauty and brutality.\n  A great book; a book in the true sense of the word.

Then the old guide Anselmo will have the same observation.  Then the old woman Pilar would have the same observation.  Then the guerrilla guard will have the same observation.  Why is everyone talking about the exact same observation?  It seems pretty bad writing and a poor understanding of human nature for everyone to be echoing Robert Jordan's thoughts.\n\nBut that amaturish style wasn't what turned me off of the book.  It was the horrible love story.  I'm a woman in my 30s and maybe this kind of tripe would appeal to guys, but the love story was not only exceedingly unrealistic, but also stupid and insulting to women.  I was curious how this horrible love story would end, so then I read the last 20 pages of the book.  The ending of the love story was even worse than the beginning.\n\nThis book was not only not insightful about human nature, it actually ran counter to human nature.\n\nI do like Hemingway's book \"The Sun Also Rises.\"  That book is a simple story, but well done.

Smiley","reviewText":"This is the first Hemingway book I've read, and I recommend it. For Whom the Bell Tolls covers a period of three full days during the Spanish Civil War, following (primarily) a young American professor of Spanish working as a guerrilla explosives expert on the Communist side (although, as we discover, not a Communist himself). The book is well-written, as one would expect of a classic, although not quite as terse as I expected given Hemingway's reputation... but certainly missing the flowery language of many earlier classics, and I suppose that's the point.\n\nOn the merits of the story alone, this is a good book. It's a war story, but don't read it for the action scenes, which are few and far between--far more time is spent getting to know the characters, their lifestyle (living in a cave in the mountains behind fascist lines), and their relationships. There's some backstory dealing with the start of the war and some philosophizing on life, love, the morality of killing in wartime, and so forth. Philosophizing in a novel generally bores me, but kudos to Hemingway for writing these passages the way a person's internal voice (well... mine anyway...) would actually sound; Robert Jordan's thought processes sound like they come from a rational, self-aware sort of man in a war zone rather than an author writing essays in the comfort of his home. There are a couple windows on the \"larger picture\" as well; my favorite section of the book deals with the myriad difficulties one of the guerrillas has getting into and through territory controlled by his own side.\n\nThe characters here are quite well-developed, especially the protagonist... although his love interest, Maria, seems like little more than a vehicle for masculine wish-fulfillment most of the time (except for the priceless scene where she informs him that she's too sore for sex). At least there is another, much better-developed female character to balance that out. Descriptions, while not flowery, are quite vivid. I learned a bit about Spanish culture and history, although my feeling is that Hemingway was writing for an audience who already knew the basics of the war; his story is a microcosm of the conflict, requiring readers to do more research to really understand it.\n\nI would have liked to see a bit more resolution at the end (who survived the day, at least?), but my only real gripe is Hemingway's direct and sometimes inaccurate rendering of Spanish dialogue. His goal--trying to give readers a feel for the Spanish language--is reasonable, but it results in characters saying stilted things that sound ridiculous in English, and sometimes are just plain incorrect. For instance, they say \"rare\" when they mean \"strange,\" that they don't want to \"molest\" someone when they want to avoid annoying them (\"raro\" in Spanish means \"strange,\" and \"molestar\" means \"to annoy\"... one would think that a writer like Hemingway must understand the concept of false cognates). And while I understand his use of the \"thou\" form in an attempt to show the difference between formal and informal forms of address in Spanish, he uses it inconsistently, and statements like \"I love thee\" in a novel set in the 20th century are just bizarre. For me the translation quickly became annoying and distracting, jolting me out of the story as I found myself translating characters' statements into Spanish to make sense of them.\n\nStill, if you can get past what another reviewer has aptly called the \"goofy English,\" this is certainly a worthy read. Lovers of classics are likely to approve all of Hemingway's editorial decisions, and for the rest, this is a fun way to get to know one of the most famous literary novelists of the 20th century. Even if you didn't like classics in school, this one is worth a shot.","summary":"A classic with broad appeal","unixReviewTime":1253664000,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

This was my first major Hemingway and, so far from finding it direct and pithy, as the author is reputed to be, I thought it tedious and repetitive, turgid in its inner monologues, and astoundingly old-fashioned in its dialogues. And yet, and yet.... Hemingway, who saw the Spanish Civil War from the inside as a reporter, has a remarkable gift for describing places such as a guerilla camp in the high mountains, capturing the undertones between people who do not really trust one another, evoking the tension before a dangerous action, then setting out the course of that action in simple concrete terms. My reading accelerated as it went on, and in the end I could hardly put the book down.\n\nI turned to this after reading a much more recent book about that war, Dave Boling's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/GUERNICA\/dp\/1596915633\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">GUERNICA<\/a>. Despite the more approachable style of the later writer, Hemingway clearly has the larger vision. Whereas Boling writes a sweeping family saga, Hemingway confines himself to a three-day period in a single area. The hero, Robert Jordan, is an American instructor from a college in Montana fighting the fascists with the International Brigade. He is sent behind enemy lines to blow up a bridge spanning a mountain gorge. To do so, he must recruit the aid of local guerrilla bands, who may or may not trust him or each other. From this simple assignment, the scope spans out in thought and flashback to a much wider canvas, not so much of place and time but of moral vision. For Hemingway (clearly anti-fascist, but no card-carrying red either) is concerned at every turn with human dignity, the liberty which makes this possible, the love and hope which makes it worthwhile, and the apparent impossibility of preserving these values in wartime. This is a novel of substance.\n\nUnfortunately, neither Hemingway nor Boling avoids the temptation to romanticize the common people of another culture. Most of Hemingway's guerrillas are two-dimensional at best, and rather difficult to tell apart. The exceptions are Pablo, the once-fearless leader now turned cautious, and his wife Pilar. But Maria, the rape-survivor with whom Robert falls in love (or at least into bed), is a male fantasy of eager compliance; he even addresses her as \"little rabbit\"! Worst of all is Hemingway's extraordinary decision to render spoken Spanish by means of an exaggeratedly literal translation, leading to lines such as: \"And what thinkest thou of this of the bridge?\" and the immortal post-coital question: \"Didst not thou feel the earth move?\" And his description of the act itself, a breathless homage to James Joyce and Gertrude Stein, may be a literary tour-de-force, but in that simple context it is laughably overblown. Hemingway had a better connection than most to people's souls and the movement of the earth; if only he did not go to such lengths to prove it!","summary":"Feeling the earth move","unixReviewTime":1252972800,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

At nearly 500 densely written pages, I found my edition of the book perhaps overly long, but nonetheless admirable. It is the story of an American named Robert Jordan who fights in the mountains outside Madrid during the Spanish Civil War.\n\nI read the book at least once when I was young, but that was at least thirty years ago. Upon picking it up again I found I remembered little except that the earth moved, and that something went amiss during the final scene. I perhaps also remembered, at least faintly, an extraordinary tale told by a character named Pilar about the fate of the fascist in a Spanish village.\n\nHemingway makes it abundantly clear that he wants to write a true book. By this, I think he means that he wants to tell us the truth about the people who fought in the Spanish Civil War, and in that goal I believe he succeeds. After reading the book, I feel a little as though I was actually there, a combatant in the war, and that I knew others who fought beside me. This is small \"t\" truth, synonymous with words such as realistic, or factual. Hemingway was not trying to tell the Truth about God.\n\nRefusing to romanticize the soldiers who fought for the Spanish Republic, he tells us what is good about them, and what is bad. It is possible, though unlikely, that I could write truthfully about the kind of highly educated Americans who I lived with most of my life. But I could never write so vividly, or so convincingly, about the kind of illiterate, or semi-literate, Spanish townspeople who inhabit this book. One understands exactly why the good guys lost this war, and yet somehow one loves these struggling, obscene, dirty people all the more for their faults.\n\nThere are several obvious accomplishments in this book. One is the amazing character Pilar, a woman in her late forties or early fifties who comes vividly to life as complex, frequently contradictory character who is simultaneously admirable and intolerable. The description of the fascists being slaughtered in a small town by the drunken Pablo is perhaps one of the better passages in all of Hemingway. Another description of a fight on a hill is impossible to put down, and of course no one is ever going to forget the scene when the earth moves, or the beautiful language that adorns nearly every page of this book.\n\nAfter reading this book, I read Of Mice and Men and then picked up Typhoon, two beautifully written books which are perhaps significantly better than For Whom the Bell Tolls. Yet neither Conrad nor Steinbeck writes as beautifully, as lyrically, or as movingly as Hemingway at his best. It is odd, perhaps even ironic, that a man so obsessed with violence and manly courage should have such a lovely, moving prose style. Hemingway inhabited the English language with an ease and skill, that even at this stage in his career, produced prose that rates as one of the glories of the English language. Some of the descriptions of nature in this book are among the finest I've ever read, particularly when Hemingway turned his attention to pine trees!\n\nHemingway's openly admitted love of violence mars this book, as do several long meditative passages about the vagaries of life, or the character of the rebel soldiers who fought with the Robert Jordan. To his credit, Hemingway's main character finally concedes that though violence is compelling, it is nevertheless evil. It is even possible that Hemingway loved not so much manly strength, as the ability to survive without giving in to the fear that can destroy a man's character, and lead him to let down not only himself, but those who work beside him. Fear must have been a torture to Hemingway, sending him into wild fits of depression and chaotic ruminations. He loved, and wrote beautifully about, those times when one feels calm, and brave, and settled. I'm not sure one really needs to face down a bull in order to achieve such a state, but I have sympathy for Hemingway's goals, if not his means.\n\nA true description about an historical event like the Spanish Civil War is a wonderful gift to bring to a reader, and one to savor and enjoy. And at the heart of the book are two characters, Robert Jordan and Maria, who are tough and admirable. Though I think some of my feminist friends would criticize me for it, I nevertheless found Maria believable, and I think that there are young women in this world who are as innocent, good and true as Maria. If there are really people in this world like Robert Jordan, I've never met them, but I suppose it is unfair to fault Hemingway for creating such an admirable hero.\n\nI should confess that I didn't really want to like this book, mostly because I don't always care for the tone adopted by so many of the people who most passionately admire Hemingway when they begin singing the praises of their hero. But though I found the going tedious at times, nevertheless I was won over by this flawed book. Somehow the lives of the poor Spaniards who lived in the hills of Spain and fought the fascists seem more real, and more worthwhile, than the lives that most of us in America live today. We are many times more sophisticated, but perhaps not quite as likable, and I have to admire Hemingway for bringing these people to life so vividly, and in such beautiful prose. It must have been extraordinary to know and work beside people who fought to bravely for such a worthy cause.","summary":"This of the Mountains and Trees","unixReviewTime":1249430400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Surely, one of Hem's goals in writing this novel was to capture in fiction the full human and political complexity of this war, which was, for a time, the great international cause. This may explain why this novel, despite its great craftsmanship and virtuosity, reads a little long. Hem, you see, had to get everything in.\n\nIMHO, the best feature of this terrific book is its wonderful Spanish characters. These participate in the war, which is a great cause for Robert Jordan, the novel's protagonist. But they participate because of family loyalty, fascist war crimes, or class rage and soldiering is mostly peripheral to their personalities. What the reader remembers is not their support of the Republic but the integrity of Anselmo, the dignity of Fernando, the humor of Agustin, the simple loving sincerity of Maria, the harsh surface of Pilar, and the murderous treachery of Pablo. These are, basically, ordinary Spaniards caught in a gruesome tragedy, not ideologues or idealists who are transformed or energized by the cause.\n\nHem also handles Robert Jordan skillfully. When Jordan first appears, he seems to be concerned only with his duty to the cause, which, on this mission, is to blow up a bridge. But quickly, Jordan meets the loving Maria. Then, through this relationship, Hem explores Jordan's thoughts and feelings on life and death. While Jordan is not an extraordinary man with breakthrough thoughts, he is an extraordinary character who, thanks to Maria, both examines the rationale for risking his life and identifies the beauty of what may be its final few days.\n\nThere are many great scenes in this novel. Among my favorites are the appearance of the planes and Pilar, at fireside, telling the story of her matador lover. And--surprise!--Hemingway is funny in FWTBT, not in a hilarious Robin Williams style, but with the dexterity of a witty companion. With Hemingway's misogyny, competitiveness, alcoholism, and depression now raised to critical prominence, I was surprised to see that the man could be a good guy.\n\nFWTBT is number 74 on the Modern Library's list of 100 Best Novels... a bit low in my estimation.","summary":"Superior novel about idealism, treachery, and guerilla warfare","unixReviewTime":1240617600,"vote":null,"image":null}

The love making scenes were ridiculous, what was this \"thou, oh, oh thou oh oh oh\" garbage?  It took me a week to get through this book, which from reading other bad reviews is pretty quick work of this novel.\n\nThis novel wasn't all bad, which is more than I can say for Catch Number 2 (that was not an error).  The three action packed scenes (The murder of the \"fascists\" at Pablo's town, Sordo's battle, and the blowing of the bridge) were actually pretty entertaining.  These were the fastest chapters of the book though they were the longest.  I did a little research on Hemingway and found that he had a minimalist style and liked verbs more than adjectives, and didn't like flowery language, I feel the man could have used an adjective or two to liven up this dull dead book.\n\nOh and watch out for that long drawn out paragraph that goes something like this \"Now, all now, and now I say now all we have is now and then now this is now and now i what we have\" that's pretty close to what he wrote and it continues with the \"nows\" Then there was the DIRECT translation of Spanish.  What was that all about?  \"Less bad\"?  That's \"menos mal\", which means literally less bad, but in English it sounds STUPID.  It's different when you read this book and are fluent in Spanish you see why the English is not less bad but all bad.  And what of the Thees and thous?  And Nays?  I get it, they were speaking archaic Spanish, one sentence at the beginning telling us that would have been sufficient, now I have to feel like I'm reading a 15th century novel.  The whole Robert Jordan thing was also annoying, just call him Bob or Robert or Jordan.  Lastly, what's with te glorification of communists?

C Cardoso","reviewText":"This is an incredibly good book. Hemingway summoned all his superior story-telling powers and forged an unforgettable wartime epic. Complex, layered and populated by memorable characters, FHTBT is a true masterpiece. It is like an Iliad for the 20th-century man. The tragedy, injustice of war, engulfing good and bad human beings alike in its remorseless swirl, is brought to life with astounding attention to detail and humanistic depth. As you may know, the story takes place during the Spanish Civil War, a brutal conflict that not only tore apart the fabric of Spain's society, but also involved armies and volunteers from the great powers and ideologies of the time, most notably the tyrannies of Soviet Communism and German\/Italian fascism.\n\nThere is no facile characterization of heroes and villains on this book. Most of the narrative zooms in on the struggle of a small band of mountain guerrilla fighters who are summoned into near-suicidal action by the arrival of American volunteer Robert Jordan with orders from the Republic. That you know in the great scheme of things their call to sacrifice and their violence is just another futile exercise in a brutal war makes it all the more poignant. And Hemingway adds enough insight into the workings of the greater armies and the machinations of politicians so the reader experiences the bigger picture as well.\n\nIn the book you find an intimate tale of struggle and courage in time of war, a moving love story, a critical view of the ideologies and idealism of the era, a couple of short-stories on bull-fighting, brutally honest accounts of war atrocities (from both sides) and moments of introspection in questions of love, life, death and hope that are as deep and moving as any. But don't forget about the adventure and suspense: Hemingway was a man of action and this is a book of men and women on a mission. You will be hooked and on the edge of your seat all the way to the (bitter-sweet?) end.\n\nThe last chapter is the most gripping piece of fiction I ever recall reading. It is unbelievably good... and Hemingway proves one more time he is a master of story endings.","summary":"Awesome Hemingway - Essential reading","unixReviewTime":1232841600,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

He did some characterizations with his voice, but not much compared to other narrators I've listened to.\n\nThis is the second time that I have read this novel; the first time was over 30 years ago in high school.

The second time around I read it as a fascinating look at how war brings out the best and worst in people.\n\nI feel that Hemingway accurately captured how certain people would act in a civil war; the cruelty by some and acts of courage by others.  In all cases, the characters were in a situation where there were no great options.  He also accurately showed that there are good people on both sides of a conflict; that soldiers do suffer by taking the lives of others.\n\nAs a Spanish speaker; I enjoyed Hemingway's use of language.  Most of the unique use of English is actually a direct literal translation of Spanish.

Eliot\n\nFirst off, let me preface this review by stating that I have never been a big fan of war novels.  Secondly, I would definitely not classify myself as an ardent aficionado of Hemingway's work.  I highly respect, admire and appreciate his contributions to American Literature, yet he wouldn't quite make it into my top 10 list of favorite American authors.  So that being said, I had my reservations and trepidations about what I was getting myself into right from the get-go.  So many books... so little time...\n\nPublished in 1940, this is a story about a young American man (Robert Jordan) who is in the International Brigades and attached to an anti-fascist unit during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939).  Jordan is an expert w\/ explosives, and his mission is to blow up a bridge during an attack of the city of Segovia.  Most of the novel is told to us from Jordan's perspective, which is obviously motivated by Hemingway's own experiences while living in Spain during this violent, chaotic era.  The story is essentially about the three days leading up to Jordan's mission and takes place in the mountains just north of the capital of Madrid.  It is here, that he meets a truly unforgettable, colorful cast of characters - Maria, Anselmo, Pablo, Pilar, Fernando, El Sordo, Agustin, Rafael, et al..., all fighting the good fight with our hero Senor Jordan.\n\nJordan, like most of Hemingway's male protagonists, is full of testosterone, a bit aloof and apathetic, disillusioned, and of course, heroic.  Papa Ernie describes him further, early on in the novel: \"He was serving in a war and he gave absolute loyalty and as complete a performance as he could give while he was serving.  But nobody owned his mind, nor his faculties for seeing and hearing, and if he were going to form judgments he would form them afterwards.\"  Like Ernest himself, Robert is a rough and tough, cynical, macho man.  However on the flip-side of that coin, he is also a very sensitive and vulnerable soul, a flawed, complex character full of contradictions.  He is a realist and a dreamer.  He is a passionate lover and a fighter\/soldier, a trusted, loyal friend and a bitter, vengeful enemy, etc...  In other words, one big ball of paradox!\n\nMany reviewers have criticized Hemingway's characters for being too simple and unsophisticated.  For example, the beautiful Maria, Jordan's love, especially takes a beating, for being so shallow and two-dimensional.  However, I don't agree with that assessment at all.  We have to remember that she is a simple, country girl who has been brutally treated by the enemy (I will not disclose how) and is caught up in trying to survive the savagery of a war.  What do expect her to be like - Isabel Archer?  Emma Bovary?  Yes, Maria is a bit too simple and submissive for most strong, modern-day women to relate with.  But Hemingway's creation of Pilar, well, there is a dame of different colors completely!  She is one of the most fascinating and also one of the funniest creations in all of literature - a truly singular and intriguing character indeed!\n\nThis was quite a nice surprise for me.  I have only read five of Hemingway's pieces, yet this one is not only my favorite, but also has enticed me to pick up a few more of his classic works.  It is the type of book that you either are going to love or going to hate and you will know which side of the fence you will fall on right from the get-go.  Hemingway was a true minimalist, and spins this heart-pounding, intense yarn in a simple, straightforward manner.  He doesn't develop his characters a la Austen, Balzac, Tolstoy, James, et al... but yet, few authors can do so much with so little like old Ernie could.  And this classic is a prime example!  Fiercely and austerely told, it is one hec of an intense ride!\n\nHighly recommended","summary":"Wow!  The bell tolls for thee...","unixReviewTime":1231372800,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

Anthony","reviewText":"This is my third experience with Hemingway, and while I fully expect to complete the entire Hemingway collection, I can't quite find it within myself to award five stars to any of the works I've read to date.\n\nIn each of the novels (The Sun Also Rises and Farewell to Arms being the other two) I've been entranced at times by the hauntingly beautiful writing, however there have been periods where the story drags, where the almost stream of consciousness style grinds the action to a halt.  Not long enough to kill the story, but enough to impact the overall reading experience.\n\nThis novel is set in Spain, during the Spanish Civil War, the idealogical precursor to the Fascist\/Communist clash soon to come on the Eastern Front of World War II.  The story primarily involves American Spanish professor and converted Republican partisan, Robert Jordan and the 72 hours he spends with an anti-fascist partisan force in the hours preceding a Republican offensive.\n\nThe characters crafted by Hemingway are fascinating, most specifically the partisan leaders Pablo and Pilar.  The interaction between the rebels and with Jordan are spellbinding.  The character of Pilar is especially haunting and her story of the execution of the fascists (a\/k\/a prominent citizens) in her small Spanish village is some of the best and most captivating writing I've ever read.\n\nUnfortunately, in my opinion, this 470 page novel is about 100 pages too long, as it is interspersed with periods of inaction, punctuated by stream of consciousness meanderings, which admittedly many may find enjoyable.\n\nSome may find the style of language irritating (Thee, Thou, Thy mother, etc.) but I found this to be a minor issue.  More problematic to me is what I can only guess is the censorship (either self censorship in light of the times or editorial censorship) whereby all instances of profanity or coarse language is omitted and replaced by bizarre alternatives.  For example, these beauties from the mouth of Pablo, \"I obscenity in the milk of all,\" and \"Go and obscenity thyself.\"  I find it hard to believe that Hemingway actually wrote this, and if not (or even if he did), these bizarre omissions cannot be rectified.\n\nDespite these minor complaints, this is an extremely educational piece of work, both from the standpoint of literature and for the insight it provides for an extremely important and interesting period of world history.  Highly recommended.","summary":"Typical Hemingway","unixReviewTime":1227916800,"vote":null,"image":null}

The book has the no-nonsense, fact-intensive style of a reporter. Yet, in its themes of love, death, heroism, and human brotherhood, Hemingway's novel is, in spite of itself, romantic in outlook, but romantic with an edge.\n\nThe novel is set in Spain in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939).  The Spanish Civil War was a multi-sided conflict between the democratically-elected government, the Republicans or loyalists, and its right-wing anti-communist opponents, the nationalists (fascists). The Republicans during this conflict had the assistance of the USSR.  Their enemies, the nationalists, were assisted by Nazi Germany and by Italy. Hemingway was a correspondent in Spain at the time.  His novel tells the story of Robert Jordan, a young American instructor in Spanish at the University of Montana who had earlier spent much time wandering through Spain. In 1936, with the outset of the conflict, Jordan volunteered his services to assist the Republicans and became an expert in explosives. Jordan idealizes his grandfather who had been a hero in the American Civil War.  Jordan's father had committed suicide.  When the novel opens, Jordan is assigned to destroy a bridge in furtherance of a Republican offensive. He works with a group of guerrillas in the mountains.\n\nThe story unfolds over a time of three days. Hemingway's book offers portrayals of a group of Jordan's Spanish compatriots, in addition to Jordan himself.  Chief among them is a 48-year old woman, Pilar, physically unattractive, earthy, and strong-willed.  She is the de facto leader of her group and is as central to the story as is Jordan. Pilar is the \"woman\" of Pablo, who was once a formidable fighter but who has become disillusioned by the conflict.  The novel includes several scenes of high tension and near violence between Jordan and Pablo. In his efforts to blow-up the bridge, Jordan is assisted by Anselmo, an aged man who despairs of violence and killing but is devoted to the Republican cause.  And, in the three days of the novel, Jordan meets and has a passionate love affair with Maria, a lovely 19-year old who has been saved from the nationalists by Pablo.\n\nHemingway is known for a terse, elliptical writing style, and it is on display in this book.  But the writing is highly varied, with long stream of conscious digressions by Jordan as he reflects upon his past life and upon the conflict in which he has thrust himself. Much of the writing is both figurative and digressive. Hemingway tried to transcribe much of Spanish idiom directly into English, particularly the use of \"thou\" for the intimate Spanish \"you.\" He also makes considerable use of untranslated Spanish phrases. The book captures the speech patterns of soldiers under tension, with much use of colorful language.  Hemingway does not reproduce this language directly but, in English, uses phrases such as \"obscenity\" or \"unprintable\" in place of the words themselves.  In addition to telling the story of the bridge and its destruction, all the characters engage in long discussions of their thoughts and their prior lives.  These discussions generally are directed to the brutality of the war.  In an outstanding passage, Pilar tells of the destruction under the command of Pablo of a group of fascist leaders who are forced to run the gauntlet before being thrown down a cliff.\n\nHemingway was in love with Spain, both for its beauty and its brutality.  The novel has many discussions of bullfighting, largely told by Pilar as she recounts her experiences with earlier lovers.  Pilar also has a power of clairvoyance in the story, especially as it relates to impending death.  The book includes several vivid battle scenes. One of these scenes tells of the gunning-down by aircraft of a group of five of the guerillas assisting Jordan at the top of a small hill.(Aircraft has a large and fearsome presence in the book.) Another effective battle scene tells of the difficult destruction of the bridge and its aftermath.\n\nThe love relationship between Robert Jordan and Maria comes to dominate the novel. The two become passionately attracted to each other and quickly consummate their relationship.  The passages describing the couple's lovemaking are central to the story and effective. The inhumanity of war is juxtaposed against human commitment and the beauty of the everyday. Robert Jordan realizes that he is in love with Maria, Spain, and with life. This love, in the book, reaches its peak in heroism and self-sacrifice.  Jordan comes to realize what in life he values.  It is because of his realization, that he ultimately must give up the things he comes to cherish.  Within its language of toughness and machismo, this novel has the theme of inevitability and of romantic tragedy.\n\nThis is a book I read in high school many years ago when it was far beyond me. It is not an easy book, and not every part of it is successful. But it is an extraordinary novel. I am grateful that I had the opportunity to revisit the book when I was able to try to appreciate it.\n\nRobin Friedman","summary":"A Difficult Romanticism","unixReviewTime":1227484800,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

For a really long time. And all of the flashbacks via thought and story start to get confusing. At times, I wasn't sure if the story was in the present or past; in the thoughts of the protagonist or the speech of another character. And speaking of characters, four of them are strong and compelling: Robert Jordan (the protagonist), Maria (his love interest), Pilar (a tough old woman), and Pablo (a once-great but now tarnished soldier). A fifth character of note is the Gypsy, but the other characters in this ensemble cast are largely indistinguishable from one another.\n\nOne more criticism: I was really hoping to get a better understanding of the Spanish Civil War and its politics. Maybe I did. But Robert Jordan and his cadre are not hardline Communists nor anarchists (they have special contempt for the latter) but \"republicans\" in their fight against the Fascists.

He falls in with a band of motley guerrillas, discovering the joy and passion of life even as he must make peace with the real possibility of his death.\n\nWhen published in 1940, there was little need to explain the title: the bell was tolling pretty loudly for just about everyone outside of Sweden and Chile as the Axis powers led by Nazi Germany rolled up giant chunks of the globe. Germany's three-year dress rehearsal had been the Spanish Civil War, where they helped Spanish fascists and monarchists overthrow the Marxist-led Republicans while Western democracies watched idly. Ernest Hemingway, a strong supporter of the Republican cause, lost arguably the only country he ever really loved.\n\n\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\" could have been an exercise in told-you-so or score settling with the right-wing victors Hemingway despised. Yet the story is so engaging - so raw and sweeping in its style, so visceral in form, and undogmatic in outlook - that it is hard to know from reading it just how bruised a champion Hemingway had been for the losing team. The most drawn-out, brutal section of narrative deals with atrocities committed by Republicans, not fascists. Rebels and Republicans alike appear oddly human.\n\n\"Do you think you have a right to kill any one? No. But I have to. How many of those you have killed have been real fascists? Very few. But they are all the enemy to whose force we are the opposing force. But you like the people of Navarra better than those of any other part of Spain. Yes. And you kill them. Yes.\"\n\nThat's one of many internal monologues Jordan has with himself in the course of the book, which may annoy some expecting more wall-to-wall action but works fine by me. It's easy imagining oneself pondering similar questions in similar situations, and the running stream-of-consciousness adds to the nail-biting tension.\n\nHemingway also does very well by the secondary characters, especially the guerrilla band Jordan takes up with. Their leader, Pablo, was a once-ruthless killer of fascists now reduced to drink and train-robbing. \"There is not enough of you left to make a sick kitten,\" says Pablo's bitter woman, Pilar, herself a tigress and Jordan's chief ally. Pilar is both supporter and scoffer of Jordan's budding relationship with Maria, a teenaged rape survivor rescued by the guerrillas. This is not a merry band of outlaws; their very fractiousness draws you in.\n\nAs a Sam Peckinpah fan, I was struck by how pleasingly similar \"For Whom The Bell Tolls\" was to the classic Western desperado saga \"The Wild Bunch\". Both are straightforward action yarns with a lot of backstory, vivid characters and setting, and a storyline that cleverly pulls you in even as it seems to ramble.\n\n\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\" is less concerned about the bridge itself (where or when precisely this action is occurring is never spelled out) then the feelings that surround warfare, and how and why one man must do what he can, for as Rick said in \"Casablanca\", the problems of one man don't add up to a hill of beans in this crazy mixed-up world. Hemingway's ending is less Hollywood but just as stirring, and a fittingly open-ended climax to this singular story.","summary":"Lives Up To Its Reputation","unixReviewTime":1212364800,"vote":null,"image":null}

The strengths lie in character development, and thematic presentation. The weaknesses lie in it's style, and language. For example, the use of what passes for colloquial Spanish, particularly in it's profane form, seems artificial and clumsy. I also think elements of the plot tend to weaken or dilute the overall effect of the climax, like when Pilar reads Jordan's palm to tell his future, thus foreshadowing events to come.\n\nThat being said, this is a very inspirational book, and Hemingway has a knack for grabbing the reader's attention, and keeping it. He is especially good in his short fiction, and an excellent example of that can be found within this novel, when Pilar tells the tale of her village. It is perhaps,the single most riveting and effective part of the novel.\n\nFOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is of course one of the great novels to deal with sacrifice for righteous causes, and devotion to higher ideals. It reminds me, in a way, of A TALE OF TWO CITIES, in that respect. It is a great noble work, and an indictment of war. There is also a great personal love story here.

That's OK, or would be, if they added to the novel but, sorry, they don't. The author is also repetitive, repeating the same point over and over in some cases. But there is no reason in terms of the plot in writing the same point over and over in this book except to (in my opinion) stretch this novella out into almost 500 pages. The first couple and the last couple of chapters are essentially where the action is. One has to ask why this story is so revered and I think the answer is because the author was so admired.

It not only pitted Spaniard against Spaniard, but became a kind of bloody curtain-raiser for World War II, with Nazi Germany and Mussolini's Italy lining up on the side of Franco's insurgents and the USSR backing the embattled left-leaning Republic. (The Western democracies - who might have prevented Spain from going fascist - followed a pusillanimous \"hands off\" policy which only emboldened the insurgents and their supporters.) Into this vortex came many writers and intellectuals. They were to witness brutality, betrayals, great valour, the corruption of ideals, and the consequences of ruthless Realpolitik.\n\nSo with all that in mind, here's an interesting question. If you were an author trying to write the great Spanish Civil War novel, would you choose to (1) sequester your handful of characters up in the mountains away from the main action; (2) write 500 pages covering a mere three days during which time nobody has anything to do; and (3) make the central character non-Spanish?\n\n500 pages about three days of waiting is the book's central problem. It turns the novel into the opposite of an epic. To have taken a canvas as sweeping as the three years of the Spanish Civil War and shrink it down to such a compass-point was an unfathomable decision on the author's part. From this self-inflicted literary ambush there is no escape for Hemingway: you either need excellent descriptive prose or superb psychological insight to carve a good story from such crooked timber, for, after all, what else is left to describe in such a situation save inner musings and the outer landscape?\n\nThe prose is the next problem. Much has been made of Hemingway's 'deceptively simple' writing style. However, I found it impossible to read \"For Whom the Bells Tolls\" without forming the impression that that his reputation for putatively well-masked complexity is itself the deception. Consider the following extracts [from the Vintage edition]:\n\nA hole in a hillside is described as:\n\n\"both deep and profound\"\n[p. 444]\n\nCharacters exchange such dialogue as:\n\n'Well, then. Oh, then. Oh, then. Oh.'\n[p. 166]\n\n'Maria.'\n'Yes.'\n'Maria.'\n'Yes.'\n'Maria.'\n'Oh, yes. Please.'\n[p. 272]\n\n'But use thy head. Thou hast much head. Use it.'\n[p. 444]\n\nWhich brings us to the Hemingway penchant for meaningless repetition:\n\n\"In an impossible situation you hang on until night to get away. You try to last out until night to get back in. You are all right, maybe, if you can stick it out until dark and then get back in.\"\n[p.  174]\n\n\"So a woman like that Pilar practically pushed this girl into your sleeping bag and what happens? Yes, what happens? What happens? You tell me what happens, please. That is just what happens. That is exactly what happens.\"\n[p.  175]\n\nFollowed by some impressive run-on rants as the author becomes completely carried away describing love scenes (How many women - even in the thirties - were seduced by being repeatedly called 'rabbit'?)\n\nMy favourite passage is when one of the characters reveals to Joaqu&iacute;n that la Pasionara has a son in Russia. Instead of naming the character, Hemingway chooses to write the following clanking line:\n\"'If we insult them a little?' the man who had spoken to Joaqu&iacute;n about la Pasionara's son in Russia asked.\"\n[p. 324]\n\nOn and on it goes like this. For three days. In a cave. This book has now gone into the umpteenth printing and neither the spelling nor grammar have been corrected (\"... the flakes was dropping diagonally ...\" [p. 185]; \"... and then brining it down ...\" [p. 213]; \"... the felling when the Ingl&eacute;s gave the order ...\" [p. 380]; at one point Andr&eacute; Marty is referred to as \"Mary\" [p. 437]).\n\nSo it needs to be said openly. Hemingway pundits who make excuses for this sort of thing have a lot of explaining to do: otherwise they are obliged to defend similarly poor writing when they find it outside the world of Nobel laureates.","summary":"Lazy and messy","unixReviewTime":1188950400,"vote":22.0,"image":null}

I thought I was pretty cool. I read \"The Sun Also Rises and A Farwell to Arms.\" I don't recall what I thought of them. But one thing I do know is that it is sometimes difficult to separate the legacy or mystique of certain writers from the work at hand.\n\nI thought most of the book was very well done. The reality of war was crafted in a way that compares well to more modern portraits of war (\"The Things They Carried,\" \"Apocalypse Now,\" \"Deer Hunter,\" \"Jarhead\"). The true violence of humiliation, dehumanization, and violation are hauntingly evoked. There are scenes in this novel that I will not forget: the killing of the fascists in Pablo and Pilar's village, the rape of Maria and the murder of her parents, the death of Anselmo at the bridge. The portrayal of men and women, those who try to hold on to some sort of moral clarity and those who lose their bearings, was brilliant. When it comes to men at war, the book shines.\n\nA technique that I found interesting was the way that Hemingway created the absent character of Kashkin. He serves as a counter point to Robert Jordan and as an example of all that could and eventually does happen. The absent character adds depth to the novel; it gives a skeleton upon which to hang the clothes of the past.\n\nHowever, there were places in the book where I felt uncomfortable, like watching the awkward intimacies of adolescents.  The love scenes in the book were failures. And I keep trying to figure out why.\n\nOne reason perhaps is that they happened without enough development. Like some romantic comedy, the two lovers see one another and almost instantly fall in love. Granted, the entire novel takes place in three days, but every other part of the narrative is carefully developed. Though the timeframe is compact, there is plenty of space in the narrative. The book is nearly 500 pages long. The sex, the declarations of love, the intimacy, it all seems hollow.\n\nIn every other place in the novel there is complexity, nuance. But when it comes to romance, to the issue of love, the novel falls into absolutes and clich&eacute;s. Robert Jordan is too righteous in his love for Maria. He is too loyal, too gentle. They love each other fully and doubtlessly. And in a novel that creates such a real portrait of war and moral ambiguity; complexity in loyalty, politics, allegiance, nationality, and idealism, to offer the reader such an ordinary, pop-song rendition of love nearly justifies skipping every section where one sees the words \"little rabbit.\"\n\nHemingway attempts to integrate language into the story by employing the occasional Spanish word along with an antiquated sort of English, full of thou and  thee. This is supposed to simulate Catalan. But it does not work. It just makes characters that talk funny.\n\nBut of course, it is after all Hemingway. And everybody should read it.","summary":"Gotta love Hemingway","unixReviewTime":1182297600,"vote":10.0,"image":null}

I do not speak Spanish or know much about the Spanish Civil War or the geography of Spain.  It did not matter.

Pablo and El Sordo, guerilla leaders, and Pilar, the \"woman of Pablo\" and Roberto's change agent, are fascinating, as are several Russians and Fernando, the rather prim guerilla.  Other characters are colorful, but not as engaging.  Hemingway tries very hard, but cannot quite bring Maria, the love interest, to life.\n\nThe issues are how to die well, the roles of individuals and small groups in large movements and wars, and whether any reform movement can change a country.  (Robert Jordan approaches, but does not reach the conclusion \"Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.  Won't get fooled again.\")  Also, does religion mean anything and is it merely \"the opium of the people\"?  Is it possible to live and die without religion when one was raised with it?\n\nCampbell Scott should get an Academy Award for this narration.  He voices all of the characters well.  (It is hopeless for a man to read Maria's perpetually ernest -- no pun intended -- lines.)  He conveys the irony, the disgust, the subtle sparring very well.  He switches from the choppy Hemingway style for Robert Jordan's thoughts to the cadences of Spanish and Russian for the others.  He absolutely brings the story and the characters to life.  I have listened to many books on tape (and CD) and this is hands down the best.  Very highly recommended.

I read this recently, since it has a reputation as one of the great Amerian novels, and my particular HS required no Hemingway.  I figured the time had come.\n\nSo now, having read it, I think For Whom the Bell Tolls was an important milestone, something of a product of its times.  There was not yet such a body of anti-war or humanist literature as there is now...perhaps Hemingway played a role in creating that.  Still, it is not just an anti-war book; intelligent people have known a long time, as Sherman put it, that war is simply \"brutality\" that cannot be made pretty.  So this is not Hemingway's main point.  If anything, he even sounds pro-war in the brief sections that justify the Spanish Civil War and the fight against the Fascists.  (He seems a little blind to the pact the Spanish Republicans made with the devil, i.e. the Russian communists, but history had not yet proven the bloodthirstiness and corruption of the Soviet Union.)\n\nHemingway's main theme in this book is personal honor, and how personal concerns affect one's perceptions and may override original, idealistic motives.  The hero, American dynamiter Robert Jordan, has snuck behind Fascist lines to help destroy a bridge and aid a planned Republican frontal attack.  But three things happen - his guerilla teammates are led by a very disillusioned old veteran, who argues bitterly with his tough old wife; and Robert falls in love Maria, with a refugee they are sheltering, raped and nearly killed by the Fascists.  Finally, his spying reveals the front is losing the element of surprise.  In this dangerous situation, he wants to call it all off, and retreat to a life of happiness with Maria.  Sorry, no further plot will be revealed here....\n\nThis way we get to study two different couples.  We learn that Pablo and Pilar, the guerillas, have killed many people, up-close and personal.  Pablo seems to have enjoyed it.  Pilar did less hands-on killing but she and the others are still dedicated to the cause.  Now here comes an outsider, a handsome young American with no real dog in this fight, bringing the front closer just when Pablo has had enough.  Even worse, he falls for Maria, and sleeps with her in his own bag, outside the cave.  (The love scenes, though not very graphic, are pretty juicy for their time.)  Pilar tries to bolster Robert's resolve, even plotting against her husband.  Maria is lost without Robert, and will follow him anywhere.  But where will Robert end up going?  He has committed himself, and he wants to fulfill his duty as a matter of honor.  What destiny will bring the best honor for both himself and Maria?  Having sacrificed so much so far, what further sacrifice do any of these people need to maintain their honor?\n\nUnlike many contemporary books, FWTBT does not have a big, overwhelming climax.  Instead, the ending unfolds in a way that you might have expected, as you read it.  This unfortunately left me a little cold, unable to decide whether I Love the Book, the way I do some others.  But it is an indispensable milestone.

The central character is an American from Montana who speaks fluent Spanish and is known as the \"dynamiter\". He sides with the republicans, as did other Americans such as the Lincoln Brigade and many other westerners and soviets  pitted against the Fascists supported by the Nazis and Italians. The American, referred to as Roberto or Ingles by the guerilla band,  joins the band behind enemy lines  with the expressed purpose of blowing up a bridge to coincide with a republican offensive. The brutality of war is evident by Maria, with the band, who was brutalized and raped while her parents were shot just because they were republicans. In contrast, demonstrating that war is brutal on both sides, Pablo, the band's soddened leader, is traumatized with guilt and feelings of defeat that haunt him with own past butchering of townsmen that were friendly to the Fascists. There is a general feeling of despair as the band attempts to regenerate itself to action in the face of an enemy well supported by aircraft and weaponry. Another key character is Pablo's lady friend Pilar who, once associated with a famous bull fighter, speaks often of manliness and she takes over the leadership temporarily vacated by Pablo's morose fall into a drunken stupor. The discussion of Spanish views of manhood provide an opportunity for Hemingway to expose his fascination with bull fighting and machismo that is both courageous and revolting. Time is fleeting, although the paperback is almost 470 pages, within in the book as an accelerated romance develops between Roberto and Marie that heightens an expectation of loss as the two fall deeply in love. Hemingway consumes the bulk of the book with dialogue within the personalities in the band such as the gypsy and the old man who seems the most dependable and balanced member. Action picks up toward the end of the book as  Pablo's band prepares to take action while the Fascists search the mountains for Pablo's associate and his band on a neighboring mountain. As Roberto and Pablo's band seek to destroy the bridge, the republican attack formes in the distance. There is an expectation of great loss and the book climaxes with the attack on the bridge and you feel an uncertainness of doom for the central characters as the end is abrupt and almost shocking. The book is a classic and very realistic, it may be too long for younger readers but it certainly outlines the tragedies of war and perhaps underlines the horror of Civil War.

Robert Jordan is the main character, an American, often comparing, often thinking. We follow him around in the midst of a not-so-pleasant, frighteningly bloody war. He is accompanied by other men who are either helping him, or have similar tasks, though not all are so. There is Pablo, who in reality, is Jordan's enemy, in that he intends to prevent Jordan from blowing up a certain bridge. There is Pablo's wife, Pilar, who tells a chunk of the book in the form of stories to Jordan about the past. There is Maria, Jordan's crush, and though many concentrate on their love, Maria is a rather flat character, though her history is one that tells more about the surrounding situation.\n\nThe book itself isn't across that long of a time span, on the other hand it includes many stories that are told to Jordan. The reader is drawn in quickly, and despite the blood, the fear, and the uneasy way everything is written, it's an incredible book. Perhaps it's because of these things; they make the book more realistic and touching to the reader.\n\nIt is certainly a great book, a wonderful read, and an interesting view on a little known event. It's a good book to read, even if you're not fond of stories with death and blood.","summary":"So many words","unixReviewTime":1161043200,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

His motives are never discussed, as are not the theater of or the reasons for the war. The novel is rather about several people who, in the course of a few days, are helping Robert Jordan complete his mission: to blow up a bridge.\n\nThe novel's tall order - being \"involved in Mankinde\" to the extent of fighting thy neighbor's civil wars - is echoed in the story's close engagement with each character. Here is the natural-born killer Pablo, his no-nonsense and wise Gypsy wife Pilar, the beautiful young girl Maria who is carrying much pain, the good old rock of a man Anselmo, who fights to win this war, but who in his bones knows that thou shalt not kill.\n\nRobert Jordan is singled out to have both the first and last name. All the other foreigners go by their last names and the Spaniards - by their first ones. Besides embodying the foreign engagement in the Spanish affair, Robert Jordan also brings a distinctly human element into the war zone: the lonely human name among the nomes de guerre of general Golzs and partisan Anselmos.\n\nThe book is written as if translated from Spanish. The language is a bit choppy, many expressions read like Spanish idioms translated verbatim, some phrases are left in Spanish. This adds to the feeling that one is in a foreign setting. As it often happens in Hemingway's novels, much working of the human spirit is revealed through this simple language.","summary":"People at war","unixReviewTime":1157587200,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

To be honest, I chose this one because I was familiar with the Metallica song that was named after this book.\n\nI found this to be one of the most difficult books I have ever read; not because of the style or because I didn't like it but because simply it was just a difficult story to read. The novel is full of strong themes about death and honor. Robert Jordan, the main character, is a man who does not get caught up in any causes or seems to hold any passionate views. Through the whole book he questions his beliefs in the socialist cause; his only concern seems to be defeating the fascists. All of this changes when he meets Maria. The two fall for each other immediately and suddenly Jordan is confronted with the real prospect of the fact that he will not survive his mission.\n\nWhat made this story so difficult to read was that Hemmingway comes across as a nihilist in the writing of this story. His characters are completely controlled by fate and feel powerless to stop the events that are put into place. It seems as if Jordan would have been better off had he not met Maria and cared about her.\n\nOverall, the story is very good.

The use of \"thy\" and \"thou\" to indicate the ud. form is ridiculous in 20th century English.  Quoting the characters as asking, \"How do you call yourself?\" instead of \"What is your name?\" is downright silly.  If Hemingway really wanted to convey what the characters were saying literally, he should have simply quoted them in Spanish and provided a translation in parentheses or in an index.  Regardless, who needs a literal translation?  How is \"How do you call yourself\" better than \"What is your name\"?  And is it really important to know who uses ud. to whom when this form doesn't even exist in modern English?  I found these \"translations\" so distracting from what was going on that I couldn't continue past chapter 2.

That is, if you read this novel chapter by chapter expecting to find some amazing answer or significance it probably is not there or very subtle at best. However, if you spent some time reflecting after having read the novel for a bit, then the novel has a greater deal of substance to it, mainly for the larger issue that is covered in the book-- what death and duty means for individuals in war time. We see this issue repeatedly in both the dialogue and inner thoughts of Robert Jordan, and Hemingway has a superb way of intertwining these two forms of prose and narration, something most authors probably couldn't do as effectively.\n\nPerhaps the biggest negative in the work is the depiction of Maria as too submissive and shallow. She seemingly just goes along with whatever Robert Jordan wants and is not able to speak a stronger voice against anything the characters are experiencing. Not only this, but she doesn't bring anything to any of the other characters, and has few lines of importance. Certainly, the fact that she has had a rough background and has endured personal tragedy (being raped, the death of her mother and father) plays a part in her submissiveness, but there are times that she comes across as just a \"stock\" damsel-in-distress type who will do anything for the hero, or, in the case of Robert Jordan, tragic hero.\n\nRobert Jordan appears to be a tragic hero because he questions many times why he is there, and why he is seeing this mission through. He goes back and forth in his conscious about what blowing up a bridge means, and contemplates the duty of why people kill when they have to in a war time setting. He doesn't appear to be completely sold on this cause in Spain, and while he seemingly never leaves this area physically, mentally he challenges the essence of being there time and time again so he can reassure himself that this is the just thing to do, and for the right cause.\n\nThis is not an easy read in the sense that there is much more to what is going on than meets the eye. There aren't big explosions every page or intense actions scenes with many fighting war; most of the action is internal and underscored. However, this is a powerful book in many points, if just for the effort of Hemingway to really get inside a protagonist's mind and show the insight that goes with it.\n\nOne final note about this particular edition (Scribner paperback edition from 1995): I don't know if other's editions were the same, but there were a few typos in this one. For this reason, if you plan on getting For Whom the Bell Tolls, I recommend you choose another edition.","summary":"Its sum is bigger than its parts","unixReviewTime":1152489600,"vote":7.0,"image":null}

To me, the story was the most interesting as a reflection of Hemingway's own experiences and strange outlooks on life.\n\nFor example, one would assume that Robert Jordan, the main character, is a reflection of what Hemingway deems heroic. Like Hemingway, Jordan is a rugged, somewhat independent sort. Jordan characterizes the literary period's allure for the expatriate life and Hemingway's fascination with Spain and dislike for the Spanish Fascist. But yet, one has to wonder what compels Jordan, an American college professor from Montana, to be involved in this Spanish Civil War to the extent that he has become a demolitions expert and is ready to kill Spaniards (regardless of what side they happen to have fallen upon) without any conscience. What busness, really and truly, is this war of his?\n\nFurther, how do you root for a hero, who is fighting for, and willing to give his life while following orders from, Communists that Hemingway makes clear are every bit as brutal as the Fascists?\n\nNotable is the fact that the Jordan character feels shame for a father who committed suicide, just as Hemingway's own father did. And for Hemingway to commit suicide 20 years after this book was written parallels the sense of inevitable doom that is a pervasive theme of this story.\n\nThis book demonstrates that Hemingway had a way with descriptions and dialogue that can be at times entertaining and at other times irritating. For example, his conventions for speech that is a more literal reflection of the Spanish language is rather clever. However, as the story progresses, Hemingway's usage of the King James-style \"Thee\" and \"Thou\" to indicate that a more formal Spanish dialect is being used becomes distractingly gimmicky and wore quite thin by the end of the book. At least, it did for me.\n\nThis is a story about people who are flawed to the extent that they will kill without hesitation...people who have abandoned God and Godly virtues, and look to themselves for their own salvation. What little is left is a cause whose means and ends don't seem to differ from the alternative, and an appeal to virtues of loyalty to the band, or one's responsibility to follow his duty. The trouble is, these appeals are made among characters who Jordan - as Hemingway's voice - often considers untrustworthy, repugnant and treacherous. Rather contradictory, I would say. And Jordan's fatalistic sense of duty to a cause of questionable politics and in a country that isn't even his own is just plain strange to say the least.\n\nInteresting as character study, and a microcosm of the Spanish Civil War, but very depressing.","summary":"Descriptive but depressing","unixReviewTime":1151798400,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

I thought that Anna Karenina was long and drawn out, but even at 800 + pages that book was less drawn out than this wprthless piece. It was completely unnecessary for it to be so long--one of Hemingway's short stories, about an old man on a bridge during the spanish civil war, at less than 3 pages is ten times more movign and poignant than this book. And it doesn't even really paint the Spanish civil war all that well--if you really want a glimpse of what it was like, go rent and watch the classic movie \"La lengua de los mariposas\" or \"Butterfly\" in English, which will give you a better idea and much mroe enjoyment at the same time. This book also isn't really that action-packed at all for a war book--I'd say fighting and battle takes up maybe two-fifths fo the book at the most, it's mostly just talking, long stories, long ten page thought streams of RJ, or just walking from place to place, describing things with some of the longest run-on sentences I've ever seen (anyone who tells you that Hemingway's style was just short and simple sentences is full of it in regard to this book).\n\nIn short, this book is not worth your time--read one of Hemingway's short stories if you must, but not this long, drawn out, boring yarn.","summary":"Worst Book I've ever read","unixReviewTime":1151280000,"vote":18.0,"image":null}

Why? Hemingway was too harsh on the deficiencies of the Communists, the International Brigades and the Republican forces in general. Above I mentioned that writers were not expected to be politically astute. That is one thing. But to say that Hemingway was essentially sabotaging the exiled Republican efforts to aid the refugees by the thrust of his novel is also politically wrong. The man did materially and militarily aid the Republican side (sponsoring volunteers and ambulances). That accrues to his honor. In short, Hemingway's writings- yes.

Unfortunately, I think a number of reviewers have missed what Hemingways is saying about the issue.  He is not saying that one man makes all the difference in the world, or that one man is meaningless compared to the whole.  What he is saying is that the world continues without him regardless of whether he changes the world or not.  The title of this book, and its theme, comes from John Donne's 17th Meditation, which says that\n\n\"...No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were. Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee...\"\n\nHemmingway masterfully tells the story of a man, Robert Jordan, who becomes involved with some Spanish gypsies on his mission to blow up a bridge to help his side win a war.  He begins thinking that it does not matter whether he lives or not, as long as he accomplishes his goal.  However, he falls in love with Maria, and suddenly wants to live.  He takes great pains to make sure that he will be able to do his job and blow up the bridge.  He finally does it.  Then he dies in the escape.  And the world continues on without him.  Hemingway is trying to say what Donne was saying:  life is not tied in the individual, though the individual may be important.  The individual is a part of the collective whole.  The issue is not whether the individual is valuable or not, but rather the issue is the individual's relation to the complex web of human existence.  Perhaps the best illustration of this idea is in Hemingway's beginning and conclusion of the book.  It begins with Robert Jordan lying in some pine needles planning his life.  It ends with him lying in pine needles dead.  The whole middle of the book simply details his part in the complex web of human existence.\n\nHemingway also explores the concept of war through Robert Jordan, who is fighting a war he does not need to be in.  Robert begins to question why he is fighting and why the war is happening.  Some have complained that Hemingway glorifies war.  I do not disagree.  I disagree when they say that it is wrong to glorify war.  It is not at all wrong to glorify the Allies side of World War II, is it?  It is wrong to glorify war for war's sake, but I'm not sure that Hemingway does that.  He glorifies the willingness to lay one's life down for what one loves, not simply dying and killing meaninglessly (which makes his own suicide later in life rather ironic).\n\nWhether you agree with Hemingway's thesis or not, it is very well written and very interesting to read.  The characters are very real, and it is neat to see what Spanish gypsies were like in the early part of the 20th century.\n\nOverall grade:  A","summary":"The difference one man makes","unixReviewTime":1147478400,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

Like all great literary works, it transcends the era in which it was written and speaks to readers for generations after the author has passed away.  This is a great novel by a great writer, and I can't understand how anyone would rate this less than five stars.  The novel spans only a few days, and contains the story of Robert Jordan, a volunteer in Spain who is sent on mission to blow up a key bridge with a band of guerillas behind the Nationalist lines as part of a Republican offensive.  The novel is primarily a dialogue between Jordan and the members of the guerilla band.  The tension builds to the final confrontation at the bridge.  There are several extensive sidebars not directly relevant to the main plot, including the discussion of the fate of Pilar's village, and the last stand of El Sordo's guerilla band.  These are probably the best written, most detailed, sections of the novel.  Some would say that these distract from the main story, but I argue that they add richness and depth to the characters and to the events of the main plot.\n\nEH writes with a direct, readable prose.  His characters are complex and multi-dimensional, and often conflicted.  One may argue as to whether this is his best work or not, or whether he was a better writer of short stories or novels.  What does it matter?  This is one of the greatest war novels, indeed one of the greatest novels, ever written.  In terms of richness and depth, only Zola's La Debacle is comparable to this work.\n\nOne thing in particular struck me about this story that make it an unconventional war novel.  Most war novels either take the philosophic position of patriotic glory for the homeland or war as a pointless exercise in destruction.  Robert Jordan has a unique perspective in this book in that he is an outsider fighting for a cause, not for a country or a government.  He isn't driven by patriotism, or love of country.  He isn't fighting for the national army of his homeland.  This gives him a unique perspective to question why he is fighting and what he is fighting for, particularly after he falls in love.","summary":"Love, duty, courage, and sacrifice","unixReviewTime":1145836800,"vote":null,"image":null}

He made the comment in his essay stating that \"Farewell to Arms\" set the standard for twentieth century fiction. With that encouragement I bought the book, read it, then ran out and bought most of Hemingway's other novels and a collection of his short stories. This novel from 1939 is his among his best works, and perhaps \"Farewell to Arms\" would be his best novel. Some of his other works such as \"Sun Also Rises\" does not have the depth and balance of the present work. This is among Hemingway's best with a good balance of prose, story, characters, and drama. It is one of his longer novels - most are short or about 300 pages - and this present book approaches 500 pages.\n\nThe Bloomsbury Guide has picked 375 top fiction authors, and among those 375 has picked 40 \"masterpieces\" and they include Hemingway's \"Farewell to Arms.\"  His contemporary, F. Scott Fitzgerald did not have any of his novels among the top 40, and there is only a select group of American writers in the Bloomsbury guide - which includes all writers. Other masterpieces include Flaubert's \"Madame Bovary,\" Lawrence's \"Sons and Lovers,\" Tolstoys's \"War and Piece\" and Joyce's \"Ulysses\" - as a sample. \"Farewell to Arms\" is shorter, more concise, and has more punch or drama than the present novel.\n\nThe story is about the fight by the partisans or guerrillas in the Spanish mountains fighting during the Spanish civil war of the late 1930s. It involves Robert Jordan, a young American, and a girl Maria. It is part love story and part a war story. Hemingway visited Spain as a war correspondent during the period. Overall, it lacks the drama and action of \"Farewell to Arms\" and is a bit rambling by comparison.\n\nThe prose is simply outstanding - as in other Hemingway novels - and the opening of the book is unforgettable:\n\n\"He lay flat on the brown, pine-needled floor of the forest, his chin on his folded arms, and high overhead the wind blew in the tops of the pine trees. The mountainside sloped gently where he lay; but below it was steep and he could see the dark of the oiled road winding through the pass. There was a stream alongside the road and far down the pass he saw a mill beside the stream and the falling water of the dam, white in the summer sunlight.\"\n\nThat prose is very similar to his masterpiece: \"Farewell to Arms.\"\n\nPart of the fun reading the book is the plot and I would avoid knowing any more than that until you read the book. The prose is exceptional and on par with Fitzgerald, Henry James, Bellow, and similar writers.\n\n5 Star masterpiece.","summary":"One of Hemingway's  Best Novels","unixReviewTime":1144627200,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

It's not anti-war, but it is about what Wilfird Owen called 'the pity of war', the terrible ironic waste of camaraderie and love and stories and landscapes, and the value of the life of just one man.\n\nSo many reviews summarise the plot, so I'll refrain.  It's almost like Hamlet, though; Robert Jordan has to blow a bridge, but four acts go by before he acts.  In that space, he and we learn what the act will really mean - nothing, in terms fo the war, but everything to him.  he's like a matador, int eh pause between the bull's turn and his impact.

Works like The Sun Also Rises, and Farewell To Arms I think require a bit more maturity to appreciate but FWTBT is a good pick for a more advanced high school student.  The novel is more plot driven than Hemingway's other works and thus a bit more exciting and readable for the general public.  Hemingway's story of an American demolition expert caught up in a mission amidst the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War is both compelling, suspensefull, thoughtfull, brutal and heartwarming all at once.\n\nLike many \"classic\" this book excels in most elements that are required for an amazing piece of literature.

I was not aware it was Republicans vs. Fascists.  I can't say I knew it was wedged right between the two world wars.  I had, from time to time, wondered why Spain was left out of the second but having never asked - I forgot about it.\n\nIn Hemmingway and Steinbeck both, I'm beginning to understand the very weight of the Communist issue in 1930s America.  Accusing someone of being a communist was a very serious charge.  Even in Spain (Robert is an American on the Republic side of the war) a man is called a communist and reacts as though it was his life he is protecting in denying the slander.\n\nI think that period writers such as these are really instrumental in keeping history alive.  The books are much easier to read than Non-Fiction (for me at least) and there aren't enough people around from that time to talk about it anymore.\n\nThe flip side to appreciating what a fictional author can bring is that, as in this, only a few players are introduced.

Mazza","reviewText":"Set during the Spanish Civil War, Ernest Hemingway's \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" tells the story of Robert Jordan, a young American who is serving as a demolitions expert for the Republican cause.  The novel follows his experiences with a band of guerrilla fighters as he undertakes a mission to blow up a strategic bridge.  The whole novel, except for some flashbacks and reminiscences of various characters, covers just a few days.\n\nAlthough the novel focuses on a small number of characters in a fairly compressed time period, Hemingway attains a real epic feel with this book.  The novel is fairly lengthy (471 pages in the 2003 Scribner edition), but I found it to be a swift read--indeed, often difficult to put down.  There is much that is noteworthy about this novel.  It offers a compelling perspective on war from the viewpoint of guerrilla forces, rather than conventional forces (interested readers might want to check out Mao Tse-Tung's \"On Guerrilla Warfare\" for some theoretical and historical perspective).  The novel also deals with the phenomenon of ideologically committed foreign forces in Spain's Fascist-versus-Republican conflict.\n\nHemingway deals with the issues of love and sex in a combat zone, as well as with the roles of women in a guerrilla force.  Other significant issues include loyalty, leadership, communications, military hardware, the impact of weather and terrain, and the connection between guerrilla and conventional forces.  Particularly interesting is Hemingway's portrait of Robert Jordan as a technically and tactically skilled guerrilla fighter, and as a leader of guerrilla fighters.  Thus the book should interest not just lovers of literature, but also serious military professionals and students of the history of warfare.\n\nHemingway offers a grim and graphic look at the brutality of 20th century warfare.  War is not glamorized or sanitized, and atrocities are described in unflinching detail.  The characters explore the ethics of killing in war.  As the story progresses, Hemingway skillfully peels back the layers of Jordan and other characters to reveal their psychological wounds.  But the book is not all about pain and violence.  In the midst of war Hemingway finds the joy and beauty that keep his characters going.  He also incorporates storytelling as a powerful motif in the book; his characters share stories with each other, recall missing untold stories, or resist a story too hard to bear.  In Hemingway's world storytelling is as essential a human activity as eating, fighting, and lovemaking.\n\nHemingway's writing appeals to all the senses as he creates some vivid scenes.  He demonstrates his mastery of the art of fiction; he continually makes interesting choices and creates some really striking and beautiful passages.  \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" is an exceptionally haunting work of literature; I consider this rich and rewarding text to be an essential volume in the canon of war fiction.  For intriguing companion texts that also deal with the Spanish Civil War, I recommend \"Spain's Cause Was Mine: A Memoir of an American Medic in the Spanish Civil War,\" by Hank Rubin, and \"The Confessions of Senora Francesca Navarro and Other Stories,\" by Natalie L.

On rereading For Whom the Bell Tolls, I was reminded of what thrilled me long ago when one could speak of \"serious\" fiction without ironic intent.\n\n  Exoticism\n  All of Hemingway's work has an exotic locale with an unusual American driving the narrative.  In this novel, Robert Jordan, a professor from Montana, is a demolition operative with a group of guerillas in the Spanish Civil War.  He lives in the mountains, eats rabbit stew with partisans, is fluent in the dialect, makes love with a senorita in his sleeping bag, destroys bridges with steely skill and faces death with aplomb.\n\n  Style\n  Hemingway's direct and lucid style is in full form.  It sounds great when read aloud.  Nobody did it better.\n  In this novel, much of the dialogue is memorable because of the literal translation from peasant Spanish.  No English speakers would carry on as they do, and the arcane cant with its earthy directness permeates the whole novel.\n  In 1940, Hemingway was unable to use 4-letter curses.  He had to substitute the word \"obscenity\" or \"nameless\" yielding something like \"I obscenity in the milk of your nameless mother.\"  Well, it's not very shocking, but I'm happy old Hem was stuck with that translation.  Had the Bell been fouled with English vulgarities, it would have come off today as quite common and the exoticism would be considerably dampened.\n\n  Women\n  Maria is Robert Jordan's love, but she is unremarkable as a character.  In those times, a warrior's love interest had to be air-headed and adulatory.  However, Pilar, the woman who commands the guerillas is an unforgettable person.  She is too fat and ugly to bed, but her skill as a story-teller and judge of people are superb.\n\n  Politics\n  In politics Hemingway was pro-peasant and he fought facists throughout Europe.  In his latter years he complained about J. Edgar Hoover tailing him, and perhaps it was not delusory.  Americans who assisted the Republicans (they were the good-guys in that time and place) were branded as Commies and were forever on the FBI trouble-maker list.  It was courageous of Hemingway to make a collaborator like Robert Jordan his hero.\n\n  Buddhist Touches\n  Robert Jordan is no monk, but he does live by some prime Buddhist principles.  He goes on for some length about living in the now- there may be no tomorrow.  Just before his death, he explains to the Maria that wherever she goes, so will he be there.  A mystical touch that cannot heal their parting.\n\n  And So\n  Read this novel to be transported to a time and place beyond the memory of all but the very old.  Human nature is displayed in the extreme- both base and uplifting.  It is one of the last great war novels that told its story without a blink.\n  Hemingway's appeal is not very complicated.  Growing up I knew some outdoorsmen and war heros, but they tended to be illiterate or mute.  I knew some good writers, but they tended to be bookish dweebs.  Ern could negotiate both camps, and he was the first writer to seize my attention.  I think he'll be charming readers for a long time.","summary":"For Whom the Bell Tolls","unixReviewTime":1122854400,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

A compelling action adventure, this is a tale filled with mystery and suspense, peopled by a cast of extraordinarily vivid characters. It is also the author's finest, and most emotional love story. Although his use of language seems simple, it is deceptively so. Hemingway deals effectively with broad themes here - love, loyalty, trust, courage and honor are some. And of course, \"For Whom The Bell Tolls,\" set against the brutal violence of the Spanish Civil War, is probably the definitive work of fiction about this pivotal period in European, and world history.\n\nGeneralissimo Francisco Franco's fascist troops invaded Spain in July 1936 in order to overthrow the newly established Republic headed by the Popular Front, (composed of liberal democrats, socialists, anarchists, trade unionists, communists and secularists. (If I have left anyone out, I am sorry - this was a truly complex and unique political situation.)\n\nThe country was basically divided into Red Spain - the Republicans, and Black Spain, represented by the landed elite, committed to a feudal system and Franco's cause, Fascists, the urban bourgeoisie, the Roman Catholic Church, and other conservative sectors. The number of casualties is only an estimate, but suggests that between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people were killed. Many of these deaths, however, were not the results of military battles, but the outcome of brutal mass executions perpetrated by both sides.\n\nDuring the war in Spain, 2,800 American volunteers took up arms to defend the Republican cause against Franco, who was aided by Hitler and Mussolini. Those who fought with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, from 1937 through 1938, believed the defense of the Republic represented the last hope of stopping the spread of international fascism. These Americans fought alongside approximately 35,000 anti-fascists from fifty-two countries. Most of the volunteers were not political, but idealists who were determined to \"make Madrid the tomb of fascism.\" Hemingway's protagonist Robert Jordan, an American professor of Spanish from Missoula, Montana, was one such volunteer.\n\nRobert Jordan, an explosives expert, has been ordered to make contact with a small band of partisan fighters in the Guadarrama Mountains of fascist controlled southern Spain. His mission, of critical importance, is to blow up a bridge, at a specific time, to facilitate a simultaneous Republican attack on the city of Segovia. Most of the novel deals with Jordan's relationships with members of the guerilla fighters, including the girl Maria with whom he falls in love. Jordan is described as, \"a young American of slight political development, but a great way with the Spaniards and a fine 'partizan' record.\" Neither a Communist nor a Marxist, he is anti-fascist. As is the case with most foreign fighters, he is under Communist discipline\/direction, because, in the conduct of the war, they eventually run the \"show\" and provide the most effective opposition.\n\nPablo is ostensibly the band's military leader. He has become disillusioned with the fight, cynical and bitter. He is no longer willing to die for any cause. A smart man, but brutal, and cunning in a mean way, he is a complex character. He does have a conscience. Pablo spends much of his time in an alcoholic stupor. When Robert Jordon enters the picture, Pablo's level of animosity reaches new heights, and his comrades, along with Robert, are afraid he will sabotage the mission. He undergoes several changes during the 3 days and 3 nights in which the story takes place.\n\nPilar is Pablo's woman, an extremely strong and savvy person, she is steeped in gypsy lore and superstition, and is probably the novel's most colorful character. She is a fine warrior who can be counted upon to cover one's back in battle. Pilar possesses a big heart. She has cared for Maria and brought the girl back to health. When Robert Jordon joins them, Pilar takes the leadership position over from Pablo, whom she no longer trusts, but still loves. She commands the allegiance of the guerrilla fighters and organizes them into a temporary alliance with \"El Sordo,\" another exceptional character. She is the force behind many of the novel's events - stimulating movement, motivating or manipulating people to take action - but for good purpose. Pilar, relates various war stories, and anecdotes, which reflect the cruelty and inhumanity of civil war.\n\nMara's life was shattered by the outbreak of the war. Her father, the mayor, along with her mother, and many of the local citizenry were shot before her eyes by the invading Fascists. Since her mother was not a Republican, but a devout Catholic, she shouted, \"Viva my husband, the town's mayor,\" before she died, rather than the more typical, \"Viva La Republica!\" Maria was then taken away and brutalized, physically and emotionally, by Franco's soldiers. When the guerilla band blew up the train on which Maria was a prisoner, they carried the dazed and broken girl to their mountain hideaway.\n\nA thrilling subplot is developed when Andrs, a guerilla, must take an urgent message across the lines to a Republican general. Roberto's entire mission, and much more importantly, the offensive, depends upon the successful and timely delivery of the dispatch. Another important character is old Anselmo, for whom Robert develops a strong attachment.\n\nA major portion of the novel is told through the thoughts of Robert Jordan, with flashbacks to meetings with Russians in Madrid, and some reflections on his father and grandfather. Jordon's inner monologues fascinate and clearly demonstrate Hemingway's skill with language and character development. Jordan, at one point comments to himself, that he is his own best companion. Because of his wartime responsibilities, he cannot allow himself to be overcome by emotion, which he considers a luxury. Whenever he feels anger, deep love, disappointment, foreboding, fear, anything that will distract him from his purpose, he talks himself down and refocuses. In such a relatively brief period, he begins to love life as never before, because of his feelings for Maria. Even here, however, he accepts that if anything happens to him, he is fortunate to have experienced a lifetime in three and a half days.\n\nAgain, I cannot write enough in praise of Hemingway's use of language. It is sparse, direct, and extremely beautiful in its descriptiveness. He translated the Spanish intimate \"tu\" form  into English. I speak Spanish, and although this may seem a bit awkward initially, it gives a much more accurate feel for the local idiom and the dialogue between Maria and Roberto, (as he is called), and between Roberto and the partisans.\n\nThis is not only an extraordinary novel, but is one of the most important in American fiction. Hemingway worked as a correspondent in Spain during the Civil War, as a reporter for the North American Newspaper Alliance (NANA). He raised money for the Republicans in their struggle against the Nationalists under General Francisco Franco.\nJANA","summary":"An American Masterpiece About A Pivotal Point In World History","unixReviewTime":1119571200,"vote":15.0,"image":null}

I disagree.  While the book does a fine job of describing the life of a partisan, its 490 pages only cover a few days' time.  So, don't expect a lot of fast-moving action.  This novel is basically a character study of the different persons in American volunteer Robert Jordan's hosting partisan band.  Therefore, if you enjoy character studies then you will indeed enjoy this book.\n\nThe plot is that Jordan is sent to blow up a bridge in the Spanish hinterland.  He is to contact a local partisan band and secure their assistance in helping him destroy the bridge.  Once he arrives at the band's secret refuge internal power struggles immediately begin as Jordan's mission will endanger the survival of all the band's members.  In addition, there is the inevitable romantic subplot between Jordan and the mysterious Maria.\n\nUtilizing the flashback as a vehicle, Hemingway defines each actor's traumatic personal history, his\/her decisions, and his character.  Jordan the idealistic young American university professor becomes the daring, charismatic, and ideologically indifferent demolitions expert.  Pablo the angry peasant becomes the murderous, avaricious guerilla leader.  Pilar the ugly yet happy wife of a diminutive bullfighter is widowed and becomes the overbearing, honorable wife of Pablo.  Maria the fragile, innocent virgin becomes the emotionally-scarred, vulnerable lover of Jordan.  Anselmo the venerable old peasant becomes the determined, brave guerilla fighter.  And so it goes with many of the other book's characters.\n\nThe book is a good character study and portrait of life as a Spanish partisan, but I found it to be much too slow moving for my taste.  This is decent novel, but it's not really a war novel.  In my opinion, Farewell to Arms is a much better war novel and is Hemingways's best book.","summary":"A few days with partisans in the Spanish Civil War","unixReviewTime":1113868800,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

I am thankful that I read \"A Farewell To Arms\" and \"The Sun Also Rises\" before reading this book, as it would have set the standard too high.\n\nIn the previous books by Hemingway that I've read, he didn't seem to develop the characters fully and many of the scenes were only the sparcest of details. It seemed much had to be filled in by the reader. But 15 years after writing \"The Sun Also Rises\" Hemingway breaks through with \"For Whom The Bell Tolls!\" In this book, Hemingway gives depth to his characters - the reader comes to know, understand, and identify with each character in this book. Hemingway also provides a wonderful description of the area. One can almost envision the mountains and villages and the bridge, which plays a central role. During the scenes involving fighting, the reader can almost hear the gun shots and watch the anguish of those injured or killed. Even in the quiet times of the book, the reader can easily place themselves at the same table as the characters and truly feel they are a part of the story.\n\nThe ending is easily figured out, but that doesn't seem to matter. Even though the reader might suspect or even know what is to happen, the events leading up to it keep the reader enthralled.\n\nThis book is a real page-turner, and Hemingway at his best.

The story is about a young American man who is fighting voluntarily against Franco's Fascist forces in Spain.  This man ends up leading a band of guerillas in what turns out to be a totally useless military foray.  The novel itself only encompasses seventy-two hours, but in that time Robert Jordan, our American hero, loses his comrades in battle, falls in love, and is badly wounded.  Hemingway's writing is masterful in this classic!  This book, even more than \"A Farewell to Arms\" outlines Hemingway's thoughts on the futility of war, and the effect that war has on one single man.  Even though the novel encompasses such a short time, Hemingway makes use of flashbacks to bring the reader into the series of events that led to this particular point in Jordan's life.  Again, Hemingway makes use of personal experiences for this novel.  He was actually involved himself in this Spanish civil war.  His writing style is spare, although incredibly vivid.

Readers see that hatred, loyalty, doubt, atrocity, ideals, and emotional wear were all part of this tragic conflict.  The story centers on American volunteer Robert Jordan and his anti-fascist comrades, a band of Spanish Loyalist guerillas operating in the hills behind enemy lines in 1937.  Jordan is planning to blow up a Fascist-held bridge as part of an upcoming Loyalist\/Republican offensive.  His comrades include Pablo, a once-dependable leader now unstable and sick of war, Pilar, a woman of remarkable fiber, and Maria, a victim of fascist atrocities with whom Jordan falls in love.  These guerillas hide in the hills while Hitler's bombers fly overhead helping the fascists.  Readers learn of atrocities committed by both sides, and see that ideals can die along with those that fall in battle.\n\nThis 1940 novel makes a powerful statement, despite losing some effect from Hemingway's wordiness and too-lengthy descriptions.

McDonnell","reviewText":"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent.  One of the best war novels I've ever read.  Now I know why Hemingway is known as one of the greatest writers of all time.  I absolutely loved \"The Old Man and Sea\", but when \"A Farewell to Arms\" fell a little short, I had my doubts.  This was the one that finally clinched it in my mind that Hemingway deserves all of the accolades he's received over the years.  It's a love story that takes place up in the mountains of Spain during the Spanish Civil War which took place in the 1930's.  The main character Robert Jordan, is a young American dynamiter in the International Brigade.  Back in the State's Jordan used to be a college professor.  Jordan's grandfather used to be a great war hero, but since his father was labeled a coward, he has set out to try to redeem the family name.  It becomes his assignment to travel into the mountains of Spain, hook up with a band of guerillas, and to blow a pivotal bridge during an upcoming campaign.  Not being as familiar with the Spanish Civil War as I would like have been before reading this novel it was a little hard at first to try to figure out who was fighting and what side Jordan was on.  I then found out there are the Fascists vs. the Republic and Jordan is on the side of the Republic.  At first I thought that members of the Republic were Communists with the ideals they were preaching and since the Russians were advising them, but then when they said some disparaging things about Communists that made me think otherwise.  The guerilla band he joins up with is led by a man named Pablo who at one time used to be great leader, but recently has lost his nerve.  He no longer is as interested in the cause as he once was, and now would rather tend to his horses instead.  He once led this band on a successful assault on a train and everybody in the band still seems to consider this their crowning achievement.  Pablo is still very smart, but nobody now knows if he can continue to be trusted to lead them.  His female companion Pillar is really the one who has held the band together for the last few months of the war, but she lacks Pablo's cunning.  She says she has a little bit of gypsy in her and at times she tells people's fortunes, not all of them however are good.  She is very feisty and was probably something in her day when she used to date several matadors.  The rest of the band is made up of an old man named Anselmo who Jordan loves very much and is one of the few people he really can rely on.  Then there is a few younger men, a pair of competent brothers, plus a strong and loyal man named Agustin, as well as a gypsy who for the most part everybody considers useless.  Finally there is the young girl named Maria.  She was rescued from the fascists during the raid on the train.  She is the daughter of a former Mayor.  Her hair had all been cut off and she isn't as beautiful as she once was, but Jordan immediately falls in love with her the first time he lays eyes on her.  In war a few days can sometimes seem like a life time and the pair make the most of what time they have together.  Pillar had taken Maria under her wing and had been teaching her how to one day be a good wife.  She approves of Jordan and Maria's union and after the fighting is over she wants him to take Maria away from this place.  As the battle nears there are several scrimmages and some great fights.  El Sordo's last stand is very memorable.  Hemingway's descriptions are magnificent.  At times Hemingway switches back and forth between Spanish and English but it never seems to be a distraction as he always provides a translation.  There are things wrong with the Republic that eventually will lead to their downfall, but at this point in the war Hemingway shows them as just little inconsistencies.  For instance, the Republic doesn't seem to believe in religion, so it is ironic that all of the band still say their little prayers every time they are in the middle of a battle.  The people also want to rule themselves rather than be ruled by the government, but they have no trust in one another.  If you are not from the same town as these people you will always be considered an outsider and an enemy.  There are too many fractions in the Republic.  They have some good ideals, but they are unable to really bring any of them to life.  Jordan figures even if they win they would probably need to get rid of most of the leaders since the majority of the ones remaining are all incompetent or murderers.  Both the Fascist and the Republic come off as being very brutal at times.  I wonder what Hemingway's political views really were.  I believe he probably had some of the same ideals that Jordan displays.  This book will make my list of the top 100 books of all time.","summary":"Hemingway is Brilliant and this Book Proves It","unixReviewTime":1103760000,"vote":null,"image":null}

It should never be required reading in high school, although intelligent young readers would certainly love it.

It is the sort of book that someone's older brother at college lends to them, and then they pass it on to their best friend, and so on. There's a lot to this book beyond the plot, but unlike many other books that strive to explore deep human themes of life, sex and death, this one is approachable and very readable.\n\nThe only reason I can think of not to drop everything and read this book right away (look how cheap the used copies are, for crying out loud!), is if you are planning a long voyage and want to make sure you have something really great to read along the way, in which case I would wait. While I am sorry that I didn't the book myself until I was 34, I had the great gift of reading it on a camping trip amidst hills, streams, pine tress and a rocky coastline that made it easy to imagine myself in the mountains of Spain along with the characters, and that made it worth the wait.","summary":"doesn't get much better, one of my top ten favorite books","unixReviewTime":1099612800,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

If you read this book you will not fail to notice a certain touch of 17th century in the way people speak to each other. I thought I would explain the reason for this as it is not self-explanatory for people who are native english-speakers. Spanish is a language where you have two forms of second person, \"you\"; as in french, and formerly English. This is the difference between the \"you\" and the \"thou\", which is used in this novel. Formerly, the \"you\" was the polite form, and the \"thou\" the familiar form (not the religious form as many might think since the only use where you actually hear it anymore is for religious stuff). So whenever you see \"thou\" being used in the novel you know it means familiarity, as in old english. If I remember correctly, Hemingway also uses turns of phrases in such a way that it makes them sound \"latin\", the way it would be done in Spanish, which is the goal. This is a bit weird I have to admit but you'll get used to it, just keep in mind it's used to approach more closely the reality of the Spanish language, and thus have a better \"translation\".\n\nWorth reading.","summary":"Great Book","unixReviewTime":1096848000,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

When reading large sections in one sitting, I really felt the weight of the experience settle on me. The novel also begins to feel increasingly existentialist as the absurdity of the structures of war and death play out for the characters involved. During \"marathon\" reading sessions on three different days, I came to see this as a literary, \"real time\" adventure, as Hemingway details almost every moment in the characters' lives.\n\nThe novel starts out with the protagonist, Robert Jordan, lying on the forest floor. Jordan, an American, is in Spain fighting on the side of the Republicans in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War. Jordan is apparently a \"code hero,\" a protagonist of Hemingway's who lives according to a code of behavior. He is a Spanish teacher from Montana who loves Spain, and is fighting, carrying out explosives missions, against the Fascists, who have a vast war machine.\n\nAt the beginning of the novel, Robert Jordan is teamed up with a band of guerrilla fighters in the mountains near a bridge he must blow as part of a Republican offensive. Anselmo, an old man who knows the land well, helps Jordan scout the bridge. Other members of the band include Pablo, a formerly great fighter, we are told, who has now \"gone bad.\" He cares primarily for his horses. His \"woman\" Pilar is a leader of the band, and she narrates on the first full day that Jordan is with them how the Republicans rose up against the Fascists in her town. The story is brutal and demonstrates the atrocities committed by the Republicans in the war as they bludgeon the town's Fascists to save bullets. Others in the group include Agustin, Eladio, Andres, Fernando and Rafael, a Gypsy. And Maria. Maria is a young woman who was the victim of atrocities in her town. She was rescued by this band of Republicans and now lives with them in the mountains. She is the \"love interest.\"\n\nI love Hemingway's voice, and this novel continues to demonstrate his ability, with that spare, journalistic style, to narrate loneliness like no one else. The seemingly simplistic style evokes a real pathos, and is especially suited to writing of war and the human spiritual conflicts such situations impose upon its participants. The reader is explosed to the morality issues of war, how characters feel about killing, what is its necessity, when is it moral, when is it wrong, etc.\n\nThe story becomes existential, very Kafkaesque, as well, when one character's interactions with command are relayed by Hemingway. I laughed allowed at the absudities, but was struck by the dire consequences of these ridiculous desicions and actions. These situations show the war machine's indifference to individual human life and the ridiculous scenarios that arise from various leaders' individual conceits and worries.\n\nI think that the book's time frame of only three days makes a strong point about war and the people one serves with. For the reader, the band in the mountains are basically the only people Robert Jordan knows (though there are brief flashbacks). One can see how those who fight together can bond so deeply in a short period of time, as practically every moment is laden with portent and their fate as a group turns on such small things as an evening snowfall.\n\nI unequivocally recommend this book.","summary":"A Real-Time Classic","unixReviewTime":1086652800,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

At a higher level, it is about connections between people: indeed, the book opens with the following quotation from John Donne:\n. . . any mans death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankinde; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.\nHemingway takes us inside a guerilla band during the Spanish Civil War, mostly through the eyes of Robert Jordan, an American professor-cum-demolitions expert.  Jordan is a Communist - at least he is strongly drawn to Communism - who has come to Spain to fight fascism.  He has character and a sense of duty.  Since, from our vantage point, at the beginning of the 21st century, it seems that not many people do, this gives the book a kind of \"long ago and far away\" feel.

Hemingway uses the archaic English \"thou\" for the Spanish \"tu\" and translates literally from Spanish to English to better convey an impression of Spanish dialogue to English readers.  These devices are initially distracting but are actually very successful at taking the reader inside the minds of the Spanish-speaking characters in this book.\nThis is a distinguished work and an exciting one.

Using the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s as his backdrop, Hemmingway critiques warfare from the political abstractions and distant generals to the individual lives it destroys, and renders all in frighteningly powerful detail with every crosscurrent coming to bear on each character in ways that are viscerally wrenching, complex and yet clear. Every shade of character and dynamic is captured as several dozen people act out a small part in a large conflict in the two-and-a-half days of a mission to blow a bridge.\nRobert Jordan, an American in the volunteer brigades, arrives deep in the mountain wilderness of Spain with orders to recruit and employ the services of irregular militia hiding out there in the vicinity of a small bridge that will be key to an impending offensive. His task requires that he win the hearts and minds of these locals in order to secure their loyalty so that he might have an effective small force for carrying out his mission. But this group of people are of conflicting feelings and understandings about their place in the conflict and what it means to each of them. Some are wary and some callous, some dedicated to the fight and others only dedicated to themselves.\nWe have real people-Anselmo's natural and true goodness, Pilar and El Sordo's dedication, Pablo's treachery, Maria's repeated loss of innocence. We have the politics and forces behind it all-selfish and hollow, or abstracted until it's no longer human. And we have warfare-sudden death, alone in the mountains, alone with your last thoughts, with the smell of burning flesh, with your last blood running silently into the dirt.\nHemmingway spares us the simplistic narrative style of describing each character's feelings. Instead, he offers the scenes themselves with such insightful observation and flawlessly rendered detail that every one of the many conflicting shifts of allegiance happening in Pablo's scheming mind is writ in his every gesture and expression and telling silence. Neither the characters nor the narrator ever need discuss these in so many words. The tensions among the characters as they huddle in their cave hideout are a fascinating web of unexpected assessments of each other, shifts of power and influence, tactical and strategic wins and loses. Though never spoken of, the delicacy and danger of Jordan's human task is clear. As a contrast there is Maria, at first seeming too childish until we realize Jordan's love for her is love for lost innocence, and that she in turn-only seventeen-has every right to her emotional fragility and her desperation.\nAnd then there is the war itself, and here again Hemmingway's powers of observation and prose composition startle. Every action bears on every other, and the individuals are placed firmly in context from the cave to the local mountains to the whole of Spain to the abstractions of global political movements. Without a syllable of pedantry the author draws the relationship between each detail of individual action and the whole of the conflict. And vice versa, with ideals or their absence making each person's motives a little different, and often making helpless puppets of them all.\nThere is very little in literature to compare with For Whom the Bell Tolls. It sees humanity at its very best and very worst simultaneously, and sees it directly in vivid, glimmering images and beautifully textured emotional nuance, without wordy narrative telling the reader what to think and when. The fact that Hemmingway yet controls our understanding with absolute ease and clarity is only half of the writer's art. His critique of warfare and its human toll, expressed in Jordan's arc of hope and tragedy and resignation, is as brutal as the fear and blood on the ground, and ultimately contemplates the interconnectedness of life and the sacrifices made to sustain it. \"No man is an islande, intire unto itselfe... Ask not for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee.\" Among the finest literature we have.","summary":"Among the Finest Literature We Have","unixReviewTime":1083628800,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

The book doesn't focus on the war as a whole but rather on the toll war takes on the people living in it.  The main character, Robert Jordan, bands with a guerilla group of which the war took its toll.  One man once a great fighter has now become a hopeless drunk who's only form of comfort other than the bottle is taking care of horses left behind.  His wife who had been beautiful once now has aged and lost her vivacity.  Another young woman lost her parents in a brutal confrontation with fascist forces and dehumanized in the process.  Hemingway's style of writing was a little too wishy washy but some of his emotional descriptions of the things that happened were intriguing.  Two of the more emotional scenes were some of the characters flashbacks of what they had gone through during the war mainly having to do with killing an enemy and being captured by an enemy.  There have been many stories about war and although war isn't something anyone can be used to this book took a perspective that has been thoroughly explored by today's standards.  At the time the book was written there was a lot of censoring where the word \"obscenity\" was substituted hence the book was intended for a wide audience.  During Hemingway's time it is understandable how this book can be grappling to an American audience.  But since then World War II and the Vietnam War have pushed aside this conflict in the minds of Americans with their tales of calamity and loss and pretty much reiterating the themes of Hemingway's book.  This is the reason why a typical American reader may not find pathos for the book.  Maybe if the book talk more about Franco, ideologies and the bigger picture of the context of the war then it may be more interesting to contemporary readers.  But this book still has a story that will be valuable for future generation.

McCauley","reviewText":"I like this Hemingway book even better than A Farewell to Arms. It \"stayed with me\" long after I had forgotten most of the details. I read the book as a university freshman, then reread it after it came strongly to mind in summer 1987. I was standing on a steep, green meadow in Schwarzwald, reshuffling the deck of life. Like a Hemingway character, I was traveling around Europe living an adventure.\nDescriptions of many scenes are memorable. Reading as a twenty year old, dynamiting the bridge and the part where Maria crawls under the blanket with Robert Jordan were the strongest. One still likes those descriptions twenty-five years later, but one then also pays attention to the long description of old dead roses as the essence of the odor of death. And one never forgets the powerful ending. Here's how I remembered the ending before rereading it yesterday: Robert Jordan, mortally wounded, sends the pregnant Maria toward safety with the rest of his escaping band of comrades. Lying on his stomach on the steep meadow, as Franco's fascist troops come up the hillside into sight, he pulls back the bolt and takes a bead on the lead officer on horseback ....\nBecause all dialogues in the book should take place in Spanish, Hemingway wrote partly in the early seventeenth century English of John Donne (readers familiar with the king James Version of the Bible, translated early in the seventeenth century, will easily recognize the language). This has the advantage of giving the reader the sensation of reading 'not-English'.\nIt's still a very powerful book. In the context of history, Hemingway was impregnated with the Teddy Roosevelt brand of heroism.","summary":"No man is an Iland ...","unixReviewTime":1077840000,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

This is a magnificent novel.\nSet in the Spanish Civil War during the 1930s it tells the story of Robert Jordan, an American volunteer fighting against Franco and his fascist allies. This is first-rate story telling, it grabs the reader from the offset and pulls him into the story.  Unlike other Hemmingway novels (i.e., The Son Also Rises), these are heroic characters that we deeply care about.\nThe imagery is magnificent.  I can still see in my minds eye, the retreating Republicans, the panicked soldiers, the horses out of control and the cartridge casings spilled in the road way.

Set during the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s, this novel explores war as it really is, not as what it is glorified or vilified to be according to the whims of a journalist or novelist.  There is very little of the actual war in the foreground of the plot--the entire novel spans only about four days--but the relationships of the characters and their interaction with one another allows the reader to see what war is like from the viewpoint of those who participate in it.  Like Crane's The Red Badge of Courage, this book deals with the psychological and human ramifications of war.\n The hero is Robert Jordan, an American idealist fighting in Spain on the side of the `Republic,' or Communist, party.  Opposite the `Reds' are the so-called fascists.  At the beginning, Jordan has an unflinching and unwavering duty to the cause, but the people he meets and a girl he falls in love with alter somewhat his outlook.  The bulk of the novel deals with Jordan's own philosophy, but also with the philosophy of the band of guerillas he is assigned to complete a mission with.  Through his love for the girl, Maria, and his interaction with the scheming rebel leader Pablo and his wife Pilar, Jordan learns much about life and war.\n The plot moves quickly enough, and all leads up to the final climactic battle at the bridge.  This is perhaps Hemingway's finest moment, and his treatment of the battle and fate of the group is nothing short of masterful.  The quote from John Donne \"never send to know for whom the bell tolls\"  looms ominously throughout the novel, and the battle of the bridge and the final, chilling moment of truth for Robert Jordan drives home the harrowing fact that is the reality of war: \"it tolls for thee.\"","summary":"\"...It tolls for thee\"","unixReviewTime":1059696000,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

He is sent to a guerrilla camp in the mountains behind the lines, where he meets those who are to help him with this task. He also meets and falls in love with Maria, a young Spanish woman who was brutalized by the fascists, and rescued by the band in a previous raid.\nHemingway details the nature of the war in the way that only he can, using his stark prose to depict the decay of the idealism that characterized the beginning of the Spanish Republic.  This is particularly evident in the character named Pablo, a once-fervent fighter for the Republic who has lost hope in the cause and just wants to be left alone in the hills. Each character has his own idea of the Republic and why they are fighting, which is as truthful a depiction of the Republican cause as could be hoped for.\nThere were three parts of this book which really stood out for me.  The first was Pilar's account of the execution of the fascists in her village.  Pablo's ruthlessness, along with the growing terror of the people who go from reluctant participants to bloodthirsty mob, is terrifying in its escalation and horrible finish. Second is the final stand of El Sordo, who accepts his fate, but draws a little pleasure and satisfaction in his efforts.  Third is the final battle in Chapter forty-three.  Hemingway doesn't overdramatize things, he realizes that things are dramatic enough, and the straight-forward presentation of the battle as things go well and then get worse carries much more impact as a result.  The stark, straight-forward writing makes these events come to life as tragic circumstances not only for the dead, but for those who survive as well.\nI would suggest that any reader do a little research into the Spanish Civil War before reading this book, as a little knowledge of the circumstances and people  of the war (like Marty and La Pasionaria) will enrich the story immensely.\nThis book is very compelling reading, as Robert Jordan struggles with love and duty, while both fearing and accepting his dangerous assignment.  In the abstract, this book is about the death of the ideal in Spain, the corruption and dissent which led to the demise of the Republic.  Hemingway conveys these ideas in a way that only Hemingway can, weaving a fabric of sadness and beauty amid hopeless circumstances.","summary":"Beautifully tragic story of love and war...","unixReviewTime":1059350400,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

What I do know is that as an engineer, I enjoy reading, especially classics, and this book has given me confidence in Hemingway as one of the best authors in American literature.\nMy first and only experience with Hemingway before was \"The Old Man and the Sea\" in high school. Part of the problem may have been in high school, but I was honestly not impressed.  However, since that time I watched the movie \"In Love and War\", I have found Hemingway more interesting, but still didn't have time to read him until I found \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\".  I think this book is just fantastic. The detail that goes into this narrative makes the book hard to put down and very full of meaning.\nThe conflict that the hero, Robert Jordan, goes through internally, externally, and mentally form the basis of what has to be one of the best character studies I've seen in a novel.  I also find the historical perspective quite fascinating as a person who enjoys history and culture.  The Spanish Civil War is something that is overlooked in our education, and I find that even the fictional account here gives insight into the larger issues faced, even if the story is focused on the inner conflict of the main character.\nThis book really shows the inferiority of modern novels and will definitely drive me to continue to read Hemingway.  The only question is what next.  I can't imagine anything being better than \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\".  My only complaint is in the style of the ending.  While it serves an interesting purpose, I don't feel it quite lives up to the quality of the rest of the book, but the concept is fantastic.","summary":"Great, Even being a casual reader","unixReviewTime":1047427200,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

Hemingway's characteristic laconic, terse, and fluid prose and dialogue shine radiantly throughout this book for the ages.  Seeing our country in the midst of the war on terrorism and a growing divisiveness amongst Americans, I feel, regardless of one's stance on war,  For Whom the Bell Tolls is a great book to pick up right now.\nTo stereotype and routinely categorize this great work as nothing more than a \"war book\" is to do it a grave injustice.  Hemingway touches on, among other things, love, loyalty, sacrifice for the greater good, rape, suicide, altruism, and social injustice.  For Whom the Bell Tolls manifests itself as a book that speaks to the reader in many indescribable ways.  Hemingway's character development is masterful and unparalleled in literature.  We come to know not only our intrepid protagonist Robert Jordan, moreover we come to know the inner thoughts and feelings of Anselmo, Maria, Pablo, Pilar, and Lieutenant Berrendo as Hemingway ingeniously flips from 3rd to 1st person narrative and then back to 3rd perdson on the drop of a dime.\nPerhaps the only negative of the book is the annoying censoring of curse words throughout the text such as, \"I obscenity in the milk of science.\"  Ironically, Hemingway's hero Robert Jordan fights for the Communist Republic(which of course mandated censorship), and his own book ends up censored.  Go figure.

Thompson","reviewText":"Hemingway expertly begins this book with John Donne's poem... \"No Man is an Island...\" The main theme of this story, to me, is centered around our connection to others. No matter if they are right down the street or across the Atlantic Ocean from us. As Donne said... (I paraphrase weakly) \"Whenever someone in mankind is hurting, it hurts me because I am part of mankind and mankind is part of me.\"\n This book has several interesting elements:\n1. Robert Jordan's strong sense of duty.\nWhy does a Spanish professor from Montana decide to leave his obiviously comfortable life to fight with the anti facist guerillas in a far away country? What compels him to give up himself so completely to fight for a people that he seemingly has no connections to? Where does Robert's commitment to duty come from? These questions are addressed and answered expertly by Hemingway in the thought process of Robert, conversations he has and lived out in his very relationships.\nThe book is dominated by Robert's \"thinking out\" of his actions in the face of what he has to do. I really enjoyed this facet of the story. I think it adds to the length of the novel but it is definitely worth reading.\n2. The demise of Pablo's sense of duty and passion.\nWhen we meet Pablo in this story, he is a man on the downside of his effectiveness. He no longer has convicitons. He no longer has a will to accoplish his goals. Pablo's lack of determination plays directly against Robert's and Pablo's wife Pilar. It is interesting to look at Pablo, the old leader of the rebel band... and how he is losing his influence over these people. His pride even causes him at times to hurt the anti facist cause, which he once felt so strongly about. Robert and Pilar are both on fire for the cause and it consumes them. Pablo has lost all his fire for the cause and is now apparently useless. (Pablo does experience some redemption in the end...)\n3. The blossoming relationship between Robert and Maria. Love in the face of impending doom.\nI'm not usually a big romance guy... at least in the books I read. But the love story between Robert and Maria is beautiful.\nIt grows out of a most impossible situation, Robert the foreign freedom fighter finds Maria the ravaged former war prisoner. She does not necessarily look beautiful on the outside but Robert loves her anyway. He loves who she is, and what she becomes to him.\nInteresting internal discussions happen for Robert about her. I love the one that talks about how he has to in essence live a whole life with Maria in 3 days. All because he is unsure of whether he will live to have a life with her after the war. These two people really loved each other and would do anything for each other.\n4. The ultimate sacrifice... Self sacrifice.\nI don't want to get into the details of the conclusion of the story. Hate to spoil a good read. But the theme of self sacrifice comes through loud and clear. To me, this is the theme of life. We make a real difference when we give up on our sense of self and make an impact on others. Whether they are people we are closely and intimatly related to, or people we have never seen before. Robert Jordan gets it... he puts others first and gives up all he has.\nRead this book... it is a rewarding experience. It is a war novel, but you will notice I rarely mentioned the war. It is so much more than a war novel. I loved it ... I think you will too.","summary":"The Importance of Putting Others First","unixReviewTime":1041379200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Did Hemingway exhaust all his courage, strength, and virility in this work?\nFWTBT is leagues away from The Sun Also Rises, taking themes from A Farewell to Arms to another level.  To the extent that Hemingway wanted to reach the apex of truth in storytelling, and to find a suitable language to express it, this book is a great achievement.  Hemingway chooses Spanish modulation of English words to power his narrative - from the start, the reader senses the honor, strength, and spirit every sentence spoken carries with it.\nErnest is not just translating from Spanish to wow us; the reader feels that when he wrote this book, Spanish was the only language that could express his happiness, his sadness, his pleasure and suffering.  Maybe Spanish contained the words and meanings Hemingway and those involved in the war for Spanish liberty sought desperately every night by the campfire - words of fear and love.\nTo me, this book was Hemingway's most significant attempt at articulating his life philosophy.  It is ominous in the hero's struggles with his personal and family history - of duty, resignation and death, inability to hope or believe, or believe that happiness can last.  You might argue that El Sordo's last stand is followed by Hemingway's personal literary last stand - against fascism, fear, and life's various illusions.  This is Hemingway's last battle.  Thereafter, he is honorably discharged to a life of fishing and beautiful memoirs.","summary":"The Bell Tolls for Ernest","unixReviewTime":1039910400,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

Friendship, strife, security, terror, love, war, good, evil; this book has them all. It is the story of Robert Jordan, a sympathizer of the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War, whose duty is to lead a band of guerrillas in blowing up a bridge as part of a Republican offensive. Along the way Jordan will learn the revolting pasts of several of the guerrillas, fall in love with one of them, and spend quite some time meditating on \"truths\" he was once sure he knew.\nNo sooner has Jordan met with the guerrillas than he discovers that one of them, fearful of being hunted down by the fascist forces, stands against him and threatens to take the entire group away. This first taste of tension is mirrored several times over in Hemingway's gripping novel as Jordan's quest to destroy his bridge turns into a contemplation of whether his cause is truly worthy or not.\nMuch of what Jordan sees recommends the latter. Jordan's guerrilla partners are not simple adornments to his crusade; they all have livid pasts and he finds much to learn from them. Even as they curse and spit at the fascists several of these guerrillas communicate, through their stories, arguments against the futility and cruelty of the war they have willfully taken up. Others, too young to realize what they have gotten into, create commentaries on war through their nave brashness.\nAdditionally the humanity of the guerrillas makes Jordan question the commands from his isolated, detached superiors. In time Jordan forms strong bonds with his friends and discovers that the thought of sending them into harm's way is not a simple abstraction. This is further complicated by a girl Jordan meets and falls in love with and Jordan's own questions about the worthiness of his orders.\nLike Robert Jordan we, as readers of For Whom The Bell Tolls, are invited to meditate on many of the thoughts that so bother him. What need a person do to live a full life? How important is it to stay true to principles, even when fighting in vain? What are the limits of brutality? These are a few of the questions Hemingway grapples with in his book. The answers are so well bound with the narrative that often one hardly notices a metaphysical discussion has occurred, but those who give the text a second look will find a philosophical subtext as gripping as the plot line.\nAs for the story,  Hemingway creates out of his assortment of characters a narrative of breathtaking beauty. For Whom The Bell Tolls has the power to move one to tears, wet hands with sweat, and force page after page of devoted reading. Hemingway's language is not the most beautiful, but in lieu of poetics his writing has the next best thing: crisp clarity.\nPerhaps the best thing to say about For Whom The Bell Tolls is that at nearly 500 pages (which glide by in a snap), scarcely one has been wasted. It is a war novel laced with the drama of a Henry James piece and a drama lacerated with the carnage of war. In other words this fine book of Hemingway's manages to transcend two genres and end up at some unknown point in between, but certainly above both.","summary":"Hemingway at his best","unixReviewTime":1030924800,"vote":7.0,"image":null}

Set during the fascist take over in 1930s Spain, For Whom the Bell Tolls is a novel that will easily stand the test of time (not much of a prediction since it was written in 1940) and is one of the finest books in the English language.  Jordan, an American, is the main character who comes to Europe to fight the good fight against Franco's military thugs.  The reader is given a fascinating in-depth look into his psyche, where he reflects on his fellow soldiers, plans for warmaking and the justifications and rationalizations along the war trail.\n\nPablo's another character who is burned into your consciousness long after you've finished reading.  A fellow rebel (they weren't rebels in the true sense, since they were fighting for a government they had duly elected; however, they have all the characteristics of guerrillas in that the Spanish military waged an immediate and violent war against that very democratically elected government), the reader is left wondering just how committed he is to the cause.  There is an incredible flashback story detailing Pablo's orchestration of the sadistic torture and humiliation of a group of wealthy fascist sympathizers.  The vivid description involved in this passage is nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nOf course the true democrats, fighting for the Republic against the well financed and better armed fascist military, eventually lose the war, but having that foreknowledge does nothing to detract from the cliff-hanger like feelings brought about by the various battles and journeys the rebel crew embarks on.\n\nThis is the best, and most accessible of all of Hemingway's works.  If someone is interested in reading Hemingway, For Whom the Bell Tolls is the perfect starting point.  As for Hemingway's style of prose, what more can be said, except that it's brilliant, enthralling and readily accessible to the common reader, unlike Joyce and Faulkner.  In my opinion, every American should give some time to Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls.  Commitment, intelligence, sacrifice and fighting for the well being of your fellow man is all there along with a terrific love story. Given that the average American attention span is like a ferret on a double espresso (Dennis Miller), very few will give books like For Whom the Bell Tolls a try with the mass of pop TV garbage out there.\n\nAn excellent companion to the book is the documentary film \"The Good Fight\" narrated by Studs Terkel.  It gives a mini history lesson of the Spanish Civil War and specifically focuses on a group of U.S. citizens (the Abraham Lincoln Brigade) who heroically went abroad and fought along side the democrats against Franco and his fascist military thugs.","summary":"Wish I could give it 6 stars","unixReviewTime":1026691200,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

Yet, Hemmingway is also considered to be a \"love him\" or \"hate him\" type. I tend toward the former, though he isn't one of my personal favorites.\nThe plot of this novel is relatively straightforward. American Robert Jordan, a member of the International Brigades fighting with the Republicans against the Fascists during the Spanish Civil War, is given the task of blowing up a bridge to prevent the Fascists from bringing up reinforcements to repel a Republican offensive. But while the plot is uncomplicated, the depth and breadth of Hemmingway's story telling are not. There are layers and layers of emotion, passion, and personal pain. You are transported to the mountains of Spain with Jordan and a band of Spanish guerilla fighters. The characters are so incredibly real, that you feel as though you could find their names in a history book. For those who have never read Hemmingway, I'd say give it a try.","summary":"A True Classic","unixReviewTime":1025395200,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

The constant use of \"obscenity,\" \"muck,\" etc. instead of the real swear words is truly wearying, and the translation of Spanish terms into \"thee,\" \"thou,\" and \"less bad\" mean nothing at all to the casual English reader.\nNor is Robert Jordan (why does Hemingway keep using his full name throughout the novel?  That's irritating too) much help, being a typical Hemingway strong-and-silent-type who drinks too much, enjoys bullfights, and lives to sleep with pretty 19-year-olds.  \"The earth moved\" is the best he can do in the supposedly passionate and brief love scenes with Maria, who enjoys pouring him more wine while washing his feet.  His doubts about doing his duty are neither profound nor convincing.  Until well into the novel he's a too-typical freedom fighter who justifies duty over Eros in dreary inner conversations.

Hemingway was very good; sycophants made him sublime. To criticize this work and not rhapsodize over its poetic beauty and its insightful symbolism would seem to be almost in bad taste. But I will do so anyway.\nOverall I would have to say that the story is good but not great: Robert Jordan is an American fighting for the communists in the Spanish civil war. He is an instructor in Spanish at a Montana college who has taken a sabbatical  to secretly come to Spain. He wants to fight to liberate the workingman. Jordan is sent by his Russian controller to join  a band of guerrillas behind Fascist lines. His mission is to blow up a bridge; this is timed to precisely coincide with a Republican (communist) offensive. Anselmo, an old man who is the most reliable guerilla, takes him to the band of rebels. The band is led by Pablo, an uncouth peasant who has gone from fervent murderous radical to a man who only wants to survive. Pilar, Pablo's woman, is the unifying force in Pablo's band. There are assorted other rebels and Maria, a refugee who has been raped by the fascists. Maria and Robert Jordan fall in love immediately and are soon fornicating like rabbits. The bridge is attacked and destroyed but this leads to the death of Anselmo and to Robert Jordan being mortally wounded. He orders Maria to go on without him and he bids her to escape and enjoy life; thereby he will live through her.\nThe book does give a good picture of the issues of the Spanish civil war. The fascists are portrayed as decent people backed by Nazis and Italian fascists. The Republicans are controlled by Russians, as are puppets on a string. Hemingway makes a point to say that the top Republicans all speak Russian, having been trained as revolutionaries in the Soviet Union. The individual peasants Jordan fights with  are mostly portrayed as decent people with a few savages thrown in for good measure.\nI had several problems with the book. I understand that Hemingway uses the archaic thee and thou to indicate that the dialogue is being spoken in Spanish. He omits this when Jordan is speaking in English or thinking to himself. This takes some getting used to but is tolerable. It is the awkward translation of Spanish obscene phrases that is done in a silly and annoying way. The phrase \"I obscenity in the milk of your father\" appears dozens of times.  No one speaks this way. It is patently unnatural and just about ruined the book for me. I understand that this is a literal translation of the Spanish oath \"me cago en la leche...\" I understand and don't care. It would have been better to leave the obscenity implied but unsaid without resorting to this awkward device.\nThere is a painfully awkward page where Robert Jordan discovers that Pablo has stolen his detonators. On page 368 he says  \"Oh muck my grandfather and muck this whole treacherous mucking country and every mucking Spaniard in it on either side and to hell forever\" and so forth ( in lieu of the word that is an acronym for \"for unlawful carnal knowledge\") about two dozen times. I understand that in 1940 that word could not appear in print but did it have to be replaced by something so witless. Funny how that word still can't appear in Amazon.com book reviews in 2002.\nThere is another especially awkward scene that sticks in my mind. Hemingway describes Robert Jordan's feelings at having reached orgasm with Maria on page 379: \"Oh now, now, now, the only now, and above all now  and there is no other now but thou now and now is thy prophet. Now and forever now. Come now, now, for there is no now but now. Yes, now. \" and so on for half a page. Give me a break!\nThere is also the problem of some of the poorly drawn and unbelievable characters. Robert Jordan is too perfect to be true (is he Jesus in disguise?). He goes from a mild mannered rural college instructor to a stone killer and demolitions expert in a matter of months. He doesn't have any personal stake in the Spanish conflict but quickly becomes a cool yet eager killer in the service of the Soviet side. His inner dialogue tells us that this is because he has always wanted to do something for downtrodden workers of the world. It is also in part to prove that he is as much a man as his (U.S.) Civil war hero grandfather. The relationship with Maria is unbelievable to the point of being absurd. Jordan is a thirty-something who has never been in love. He and Maria, who is 19,  fall in love at first sight. They immediately decide to have sex ; they plan to get married and live together happily ever after. He is fully aware that he has been handed a suicide mission and is completely unconcerned. How did he live for this long if his own safety is of no interest to him?\nMuch has been made of the fact that this book illustrated the concepts in the Donne poem No Man is an Iland. Well then why do we need nearly five hundred pages of this book when that poem says it so well in a few lines.","summary":"A very good but flawed classic","unixReviewTime":1010620800,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

Here he employs it to explain the events of a few days during the Spanish Civil War.  The plot is simple: an American fighting for the republic joins a small guerrilla unit in the hills, under orders to blow up a bridge at the beginning of a great assault on the fascists.  The American also falls in love with a young Spanish girl, thus allowing Hemingway to explore his favorite combination of themes, love and war.\nHemingway is, in my view, one of the most moving and profound writers of all time.  In this novel, he aptly captures the emotions and motives of those who risk their lives at war, and along the way, offers some extraordinarily memorable stories of both bravery and brutality.\nTo me, the novel's main weakness is the love story.  The protagonist's love interest, as in all of Hemingway's novels, is young (19 years old, in this case), beautiful, naive, and ignorant.  She worships Robert Jordan, and obeys his every command much as a puppy.  Having no mind of her own, she is wholly contented by serving Jordan in ways such as washing his socks and and drying out his sleeping bag.\nThe only other oddity in the novel is Hemingway's habit of translating Spanish literally.  For example, he uses thou and you to differentiate between the Spanish speaker's use of \"tu\" and \"Usted.\"  He also uses such nonsensical phrases as \"I have much hunger\" as a translation for the Spanish \"tengo mucho hambre,\" and \"What passes with thee?\" for \"Qu te pasa?\".  I found that a bit distracting.\nOn the whole, however, I found the novel remarkable.  Hemingway's ability to pare down complex ideas and events into such simple, powerful prose is unsurpassed.","summary":"Great at war, so-so at love","unixReviewTime":1005091200,"vote":null,"image":null}

I'll never forget my first reading of this book. One of those books you put down and just hold your breath with the memory of it all. This might best be described as Hemingway fare for non Hemingway fans. Though Hemingway fans like it too, but it will always be number three to them. The Sun Also Rises is perhaps one of the more difficult books to summarize and Hemingway's style is so new in it that the book created a buzz that has still not died down. What was not said in that first book left some feeling a bit famished. Others were intrigued by this new kind of writing that held its cards so close to its chest. In this book you get a more conventional novel of a novel though the events described in it are very powerfully told. (It is fun to see pictures of Hemingway as a reporter at this time. A world famous novelist in the field.) This book along with A Farewell to Arms prove no American knew better how to convey by written words that nasty busines of war better than Hemingway.

Of course I am humble enough to I ask myself \"What more is there to say about \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" that the reviewers and others haven't said already?\" Yet here I am... writing another review about Hemingway's masterpiece...\n\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" is the tale of two of man's most cherished and hated traditions: Love and War. We enter the story somewhere in Spain, in 1937, under the Spanish Civil War. We follow Robert Jordan -the American (teacher, now a demolition expert), and a group of guerrilla loyalists; Pablo leader of the group, his woman Pilar and the girl Maria (a prisoner rescued by Pablo).\nWe follow the group, and especially Robert's, effort, fighting for the Republic against the Fascists. The entire novel only covers a span of three days, so we truly get a sense of the time passing. While the story develops we recognise that the real leader of the group is not Pablo, but his woman, Pilar. We watch Robert develop an intense love for the girl Maria and reading the part where Robert and Maria are taking farewell brought tears to my eyes...\nIt is not possible to not genuinely care for each individual in the story, because the characters are few, and they are all very well developed.

Although, as I mentioned, the whole book is only about Robert Jordan blowing up a single bridge, the book widens in scope as it goes on allowing us to see the war from more and more angles, through more and more people, on both sides of the fight and of all rank and position.  It drives homet the point that the title of the book suggests.  Ask not for whom the bell tolls, the bell tolls for thee.  This refers to the church bells that would be rung to announce a death and is part of a larger quote which begins familiarly enough, \"No man is an island.\"  Simply put, there is no such thing as isolationism, there is no way to not consider yourself a part of the human race.  When you hear of someone!'s death, there is no need to wonder whose death it is, for whomever it was, they were a part of you, and so their death is in a way your death.  Their jouney was your journey.

To begin with its set in Spain, in the midst of an  all but forgotten conflict, the Spanish Civil War. Then there's our hero, a young university lecturer Robert Jordan, linguist and  fluent in Spanish, French, and probably German.\nJordan is one of the most likable people in American literature, in many ways the all-American hero. Yet he's fighting for the  communists...under a Russian general, with a guerilla (terrorist?) group that seems distinctly low on  ideals, and high on banditry and brutality.\nThen there's the novel's philosophy, which the title implicitly states, which supports the notion of community, and  co-operation, and the importance of individual sacrifice for the common good. Foreign and un-American indeed, yet  brilliantly handled - even a Fascist Officer becomes someone we can sympathise with (and is probably Robert Jordan's last  victim).\nA curious feature is the pervasive irony, so absent from much current American writing and conversation. Its manifest in  many episodes, and provides much sly humour, such as when Robert Jordan speaks of machine guns jamming or running out  of ammunition but does so in English. When his Spanish comrades ask him what he's talking about, he simply replies \"just  looking into the future in English.\"\nHemingway's main innovation is a simple yet brilliant: Render the Spanish dialogue in English, but make it a simi-literal  translation; so for instance \"What's your name?\" becomes \"How are you called?\" Its a little awkward for the first few pages,  then we adjust, but never forget that Robert Jordan is speaking Spanish to Spanish speakers.\nGood novelists write books with strong main characters, great ones make even the minor characters memorable. And  so it is with this book, from the uneducated yet thoughtful old man Anselmo, to the half deaf leader of a neighboring guerilla band, El Sordo.\nFinally, in an era of up-beat feelings and the importance of positive thinking, For Whom the Bell Tolls is an extraordinarily pessimistic and downbeat novel...\nTruly an American classic, maybe the strangest of them all.","summary":"A Masterpiece","unixReviewTime":991180800,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

Fortunately, Pilar is an interesting character who adds some spice to the proceedings. The only real point to this novel seems to be conveyed by its fine title, a reference to a John Donne poem. Loosely, the poem conveyed the idea that whatever happens to any human being ought perhaps to be the business of all of us. In the case of the novel, Hemingway draws attention to the largely overlooked Spanish Civil War and its suffering.

They are given no distinctive voice of their own and are almost always dealt a tragic fate. This cannot be said of Pilar from \"For Whom The Bell Tolls.\" She is one of Hemingway's strongest female characters and has often been characterized as \"the real leader of the guerrilla band.\" Pablo may hold that title at the beginning of the novel, but as the novel progresses, Pilar's authoritative stature becomes more and more evident. Pilar is a rather contradicting figure and this is a testament to Hemingway's ability to fictionally construct her well. On the one hand, existing in male-dominated culture, she is fully domesticated, expert in her knowledge on how to perform traditional womanly duties. On the other hand, she is not entirely complaisant or silent willed. She will not hesitate to speak her mind nor will she hesitate to take up arms and fight with the men.

For fans of Hemmingway's prose this novel is a true masterpiece, but even those who aren't particularly fond of Hemmingway's sparse style will find lots to like in For Whom The Bell Tolls.\nWrapped in a brisk plot of pre-combat suspense and the ensuing battle Hemmingway has hidden the definitive anti-war novel.  In the three days that we follow Robert Jordan's efforts for the Republic against the Fascists we watch him develop a love of incredible intensity with the girl Maria, then willingly throw everything away for a senseless fight between two equally irrational forces struggling for power in the eve of WWII.\nThe most powerful account of brutality and inhumanity is not attributed to the Fascists, but is Pilar's tale of the early days of the revolution and atrocities carried out by the Republicans - the side for which Jordan is risking his life.  Although moved by the tale and by Pilar's excellent account (indeed as most reviews comment this self-contained story of Pilar's is the strongest part of the novel) Jordan cannot veer from the path that has been set for him, both by his war hero grandfather and by his father; Jordan views his father as a coward because he died by suicide - a them which runs through the novel.  Even his unexpected discovery of Maria and true love cannot deflect him from his course of self-destruction.\nAs an anti-war novel For Whom The Bell Tolls is elegant and subtle.  Hemmingway, in typical fashion, lionizes the warriors.  The American Jordan and the guerilla leader El Sordo are depicted as noble men of principle.  Even his treatment of the fascist lieutenant Berrendo is sympathetic.  Hemmingway's commentary is an attack on the senselessness of war (or this particular war, anyway) but those who fight that war are largely treated as tragic figures.\nThe characters are among the most complete that I've encountered in a novel.  In that they're developed using Hemmingway's sparse style makes the feat all the more impressive.  The novel perhaps is a bit long, and there are in my opinion some extraneous elements that could have been omitted, but the conclusion is a masterpiece.  There are not many novels that have had as great an emotional effect on me.  A must read.","summary":"A must read  the definitive anti-war tale","unixReviewTime":974332800,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

You will learn a lot about yourself by considering which elements you notice most strongly.  Reading For Whom the Bell Tolls is like holding up a mirror to your soul.\nOn the surface this is a book about 3 days and nights of war.  But with the action packed into that time and extensive use of flashbacks, it becomes a tapestry of all humankind.  After you start to notice the individual threads in the tapestry, be sure to step back and see the whole.  For the remarkably balanced and connected artistry of the themes and directions in the story is what makes this book great.\nIf you are disturbed by descriptions of violence, brutality, and inhumanity, you will not enjoy this book.\nRobert Jordan is an American who has joined the republican side of the Spanish civil war.  In normal life, he teaches Spanish.  Now, he is transformed into a demolitions expert who can blow up trains and bridges.  With an offensive coming, he moves behind the fascist lines to join a guerilla group to blow a key bridge during an offensive that begins in 3 days.  The rest of the story covers the action of preparing for and attacking the bridge.  Along the way, you will become acquainted with the characters in the guerilla band as well as Jordan.  Jordan will find himself moved in many ways to become more alive and fully connected than he has ever been before.  He will experience the full range of human emotion and life within these 3 days.\nIf you don't know about the Spanish Civil War, you should be aware that it was the main warm-up for World War II.  The fascists under Franco were supported by Hitler and Mussolini.  Hitler wanted to try out his new weapons and fine-tune tactical theory before attacking the rest of Europe.  Communists from around the world flocked to the republic, as did pro-democracy volunteers.  The republican forces had great popular support but had little war materiel and fought a losing campaign that created great anguish in the international community.\nCivil wars are one of the worst forms of human conflict.  Because the people are so much alike, they tend to behave with greater savagery towards one another.  With modern weapons of mass destruction, the effects can be awful beginning with the American Civil War.  Hemingway does a great job of showing the essential sameness of the forces on both sides in human terms, and takes away the meaning of their causes to show the greater importance of their humanity.  The book reminds me in this aspect very much of All Quiet on the Western Front, the great ant-iwar novel about trench warfare in World War I.\nAs is usual with Hemingway, the writing is spare, effective, and graceful.  Stylists will be delighted!\nWhy should you read this book today?  You will probably not fight in a civil war.  Or will you?  For in fact, humans are as divided in their competitions as ever.  They just normally don't involve bloodshed.  There is great glory in the conflict, but even greater potential in their cooperation.  Ask yourself about where you compete now and what could be accomplished if you focused on constructive cooperation instead.  Think about this concerning your family, your love, your work, your hobbies, and your volunteer activities.  Like the quote above, wherever there is one of us the other is present.  If you start to represent each other's interests and connect with one another, the sum of mankind is greater and so is each person.  You will also love life more!","summary":"\"Whichever one there is, is both.\"","unixReviewTime":970704000,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

Feel free to read those  reviews as well.  In his best piece, Old Man and the Sea, Hemingway  describes a man's courage and conviction in a mini-epic struggle between  and elderly man and the greatest catch of his life (a giant marlin).  In  another book, The Sun also Rises, Hemingway paints a very rich and colorful  portraitt of Spain and Pamplona that I could not sum up in a few sentences.  Both books create a vivid picture almost unequaled in literature.\nThis  book, however, does nothing of the sort.  Excluding a side story that  concerns the massacre of a town of locals, it is repetitive, boring, and  provides little insight.  The majority of this 450 page book takes place in  one cave and provides very little substance.  Personally, no picture was  painted for me, no human character was exposed, and no real lasting meaning  came from this book.\nI grew tired of the cave, tired of the speculation  about killing the Guerilla leader Pablo, and bored of the lightweight,  unreal romance.  An editor could have spliced away pages 200-400, and the  book would have not missed a beat.\nIf you're a casual reader like myself,  stick with other Hemingway works.","summary":"A long repetitive novel about a cave","unixReviewTime":967939200,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

The fortuitous nature of  existence, or the unbiased treatment of fate, or the luring equivocation of  individuality?  In the pitifully short three days, no, better be accurate,  two and a half days during a crucial advance for the republic forces in  Spain, Hemingway leads us toward the bullpen, behind which hid a chimera  that is to hunt us all our lives with the echo of Donne's famed line.\nHemingway draws every little details together as a pounding fist-beating  recursive chimes into the readers' ears. And with the slower, more  passionate journey into Jordan's memory and future in a way, we become  enthralled as well to the question of choice. How will he choose? Jordan, a  formal Spanish professor in the University of Montana, chooses to foresake  the capitalist luxury of America and pursues the life as a republic  dynamiter in Spain.\nThere is no question of individuality, only a  question of choice, a choice between masses and not identities.  All this  remains intact until Robert's own vision is no longer able to see between  simple black and white in the Spanish mountains where he prepares to blow  up a bridge during a republic offensive. His comrades are not all  communists, nor are his enemies all fascists; these men die not for an  ideal, but for an idea. And as he grows to love the rough Spaniards around  him: shrewd yet cowardly Pablo, thoughtful hunter Ansemlo, strong and  foreseeing Pilar, and most of all, a young woman ravaged many times by  fascist soldiers, Jordan starts to doubt the path he chooses. And between  life and death, ideal and reality, he waivers.\nPablo is a sharp thread  that seams between characters and draws Jordan on with questions; he  appears cowardly despite his heroic records as a guerilla leader, and his  own dawdling conviction towards the idea of republic pricks Jordan's own  sense of duty. Especially with more and more emotional involvement  (dependency) on Maria's love, Jordan is wondering whether enough killing is  enough killing for a vague concept. Pablo's seemingly growing discontent,  as a part of a mass, is complemented by his woman Pilar's undying strength.  She reads palms and smells death, and it is through her strong faith in the  union of freedom seekers that the guerrilla group stays together. But  exactly \"for whom\" the bell tolls? For the Spaniards who shed blood among  themselves with visible strings from Moscow? Yes, warfare befalls all, no  one is missed by the silent blow although some can smell its scent and  others shun its path. A dangerous sadness identifies Pablo while an  optimistic cheerfulness characterizes Pilar, why are they essentially the  same \"lot\" then? Because Hemingway shows us, through the interaction of  specter of differences, a single vibration enlivens every frequency on the  scale. Robert Jordan is a mere node not knowing which direction to lean  towards, especially as he is starting to doubt the vibration.\nAmerica  hasn't had her share of good wars, but what happens in one war is reflected  in the next, or isn't it? If one strong man's mentality comes tumbling down  because the buttress isn't strong enough, why shouldn't the next one fumble  as well? It tolls for thee, and there are a million \"thee\" out there  blindly believing they are the only \"thee\". They hear the same ringing,  although each believes he is able to distinguish a unique frequency; and  they die, their deaths as mere statistics. Thus it is actually an oxymoron  Hemingway presents through Robert Jordan's developing anxieties; he feels  \"tricked\" into believing the impact he himself can make in the war, as a  part of a hovering mass, instead, he recovers pieces of individuality when  he is physically and emotionally removed from the same mass. So at the  beginning, he lays on one stretch of pine forest floor and hears this bell  chime calling him to begin, he joins the guerilla band; at the end, he is  wounded and is left behind to lay on the same stretch of pine forest floor,  and he hears this bell chime calling him to end. The integration and  disintegration mark his journey from blindness to sight.\nTwo and a half  days, who ever lives out their entire existence in such a short period?  Jordan does, and he sees so far into the pattern of living that he does  regret the ultimate choice he makes, not as a soldier, or a leftist, but as  a man redeemed through the moral bath of contemplation.","summary":"Swiftly compelling--Hemingway at his best","unixReviewTime":966729600,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

I was a high school kid in the early 1970s, working on my campus newspaper, newly graduated from Jack London but not yet ready for Jack Kerouac.\nTo  my young eyes, it was a good action story:  Robert Jordan, the passionate  American teacher joins a band of armed gypsies in the Spanish Civil War.  He believes one man can make a difference.  The whole novel covers just 68  hours, during which Jordan must find a way to blow up a key bridge behind  enemy lines.  In that short time, Jordan also falls in love with Maria, a  beautiful Spanish woman who has been raped by enemy soldiers.  The whole  spectrum of literature was refracted through the prism of my youth: Good  guys and bad guys, sex and blood, life and death.  For me, just a boy, the  journey from abstraction to clarity was only just beginning.\nRe-reading  \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" at 42 (roughly the age Hemingway was  when he published it), I have lost my ability to see things clearly in  black and white.  My vision is blurred by irony, as I note that two  enemies, the moral killer Anselmo and the sympathetic fascist Lieutenant  Berrendo, utter the very same prayer.  For the first time, I see that the  book opens with Robert Jordan lying on the \"pine-needled floor of the  forest\" and closes as he feels his heart pounding against the  \"pine needle floor of the forest\"; Jordan ends as he begins,  perhaps having never really moved.  I certainly could never have seen at 16  how dying well might be more consequential than living well.  And somehow  the light has changed in the past 26 years, so that I now truly understand  how the earth can move.\nAs a teen, I missed another crucial element, even  though Vietnam was still a seeping wound.  Three pivotal days in Jordan's  life force him to question his own role in a futile war.  He wonders if  dying for a political cause might be too wasteful, but he ultimately  believes that dying to save another individual is a man's most heroic act.\nThe book's title is taken from John Donne's celebrated poem: \"No  man is an Iland ... and therefore never send to know for whom the bell  tolls; It tolls for thee.\" It was not about loneliness and aloneness,  as I once had thought, but about the seamless fabric of all life:  What  happens to one happens to all.\nI am not blind to Hemingway's flaws.  He  was a good short writer, and what was short was almost always better.  Pilar's tale on the mountainside has been widely acclaimed as the most  powerful of Hemingway's prose.  Her story within a story is nothing less  than a contemporary myth.\n\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" has also  been regarded as Hemingway's capitulation to critics who barked that his  innovative style was too lean, and as a consciously commercial exercise for  which Hollywood might (and did) pay handsomely.  Robert Jordan, in so many  respects, was a tragic mythical hero in the vein of Achilles, Gawain and  Samson.  \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" ranks as one of the great  American war novels in a country that has always struggled with the concept  of good and bad wars.","summary":"Still haunted by Hemingway","unixReviewTime":959904000,"vote":561.0,"image":null}

A lot of it isn't controversial, like not being a prisoner of your past, having goals and self-discipline, concentrating on the present moment, managing your time well and doing nice things to others. But Robin wraps it all up in the most glittering gold paper, places it on a silver platter and voila! the universe grants all your inmost dreams. Exorbitant promises are made in fulsome language such as, \"When you live your life to its highest level, the strength of your soul will guide you to a magical place with magnificent treasures,\" or \"once you do this, abundance flows into your life and all your desires are filled with ease and grace.\" Does anyone think that all the ills of human existence, all our innate defects of morality and personality, and all the past traumas that shape who we are can be so easily blown away? If so, what a wonderful world this would be!\n\nTo add insult to injury, Robin creates a fantastical frame for his book, purveying the conceit that these are all ancient principles transmitted by a group of Himalayan monks who live remote, pure lives. Instead, they sound more like good resolutions that one makes at the start of each new year, to be forgotten as each day drags us down with its myriad of challenges and one can't even keep off that extra chocolate cake let alone transmogrify into superior beings capable of earning the millions that the writer makes telling us how to be good.","summary":"The Most Glittering Gold Paper","unixReviewTime":1500508800,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

My expectations were very high. I found the book to be good overall, but not as outstanding as I hoped it would be. I must admit though, I'm not a fan of general fiction which is why I might have not enjoyed it as much as others.\n\nIn his book, Robin tries to communicate 7 different virtues that can help elevate a person's way of living. He does this via a monk who was a successful lawyer in his previoua life who got burnt out. The main story is based on a creative visual of a beauttiful garden that Robin put in place to help the reader parse the 7 virtues. I did find the narrative a bit 'backwards', in the sense that Robin seems to have worked backwards from the idea of this garden and forced the narrative. I also found it a little funny that the junior mawyer, who the monk was talking to throughout the story, seemed a lot more naive about life than you'd expect :-).\n\nOverall, Robin does present some provocative thoughts that are worth considering and great one liner quites that stuck with me. As a result I am rating this book as a 4 star!","summary":"Good book that may inspire actions in my daily life","unixReviewTime":1477612800,"vote":null,"image":null}

There he searches for a mysterious group of sages high up in the Himalayas to lived with them and acquire their ageless wisdom. This storyline functions as a catalyst for spiritual subjects, a nice cocktail of Buddhism, positive thinking, inspiring sayings, and interesting statistics. All the spiritual basics are there, the content is well rounded and the reader is enticed to apply the wisdom at once.\nI was slightly disappointed by the quality of the storyline: too much telling and allegories sometimes glitch into clichs, e.g. comparing the mind with a full glass. Having said that, the book was written fifteen years ago and the allegories may not have been overused at that time. Also, the author sometimes mixed the sources of wisdom. Example: the sages discovered that people think 60,000 thoughts a day. Sages don't run statistics.\nThe book is an excellent example of SEO optimized writing. The title itself (factually incorrect) is a little gem of marketing strategy. It combines hot trends at the time the book was written: fast cars, dropping out, and spirituality. The core allegory of the book is priceless too: You will recall that the sumo wrestler who walked out of the lighthouse in the middle of a beautiful garden with nothing more than a pink wire cable covering his private parts slipped on a shiny gold stopwatch and fell to the ground. After what seemed like an eternity, he finally regained consciousness when the marvelous fragrance of the yellow roses reached his nose. He then jumped to his feet in delight and was astonished to see a long, winding path studded with millions of tiny diamonds. Of course, our friend the sumo wrestler took the path and, in doing so, lived happily ever after. This strange allegory serves as a great suspense that keeps the reader turning the pages.\n\nStefan Emunds is an author of spiritual and inspirational fiction and non-fiction.

Decide, once and for all, to be the master of your fate. Run your own race. Discover your calling and you will start to experience the ecstasy of an inspired life.\n\nWhen you run inspiring, imaginative pictures through the movie screen of your mind, wonderful things start to happen in your life. Einstein said that imagination is more important than knowledge. You must spend some time every day, even if it is just a few minutes, in the practice of creative envisioning. See yourself as you want to be, whether this means serving as a great judge, a great father or a great citizen of your community.\n\n~ Robin Sharma from The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari\n\nRobin Sharma is one of the worlds top leadership expertsright up there with Jack Welch and Tom Peters. In fact, he was recently recognized as the #2 leadership guru in the world. He also happens to be a great author and a super cool guy.\n\nWhen I was running Zaadz, our companies did some work together and I got a copy of his book, The Greatness Guide. AMAZING. I loved it so much I had autographed copies sent to everyone on our team immediately. Several months later Robin and I connected in Los Angeles. Our breakfast turned into me driving him to the airport to continue our chat and, after 4 or 5 loops around LAX buying some time before his flight, I finally had to send him off with an OMG! I just met a soul-brother! hug. (Love it when that happens! :)\n\nIt's a fun, quick-reading fable that lives up to its subtitle of being about Fulfilling Your Dreams and Reaching Your Destiny. (Think: The Alchemist with yogi-attorneys rather than a shepherd. In fact, Paulo Coelho, another one of my absolute favorite authors, said this about the book: A captivating story that teaches as it delights.)\n\nHere are some of the Big Ideas:\n\n1. The 7 Timeless Virtues - of enlightened living.\n2. Invest In Yourself - Its a good investment. :)\n3. Blueprinting - It starts in your mind.\n4. Secret of Happiness - Do what you love!\n5. Rise with the Sun - Tomorrow AM good?\n\nSo, heres to creating a gorgeous little blip on the canvas of eternity glowing with the radiance of honoring our ultimate purpose in life.\n\n(More goodness--including PhilosophersNotes on 250+ books at[...])","summary":"It's a fun, quick-reading fable that lives up to its subtitle.","unixReviewTime":1452816000,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

I love his book The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari: A Fable About Fulfilling Your Dreams and Reaching Your Destiny so much that I gave it away as a Christmas present to my friends one year. This book was also listed as one of top 10 books that changed my life. Recently, I re-visited the book, and decided to write this review.\n\nIn this book, Julian Mantle is a superstar lawyer whose out-of-balance lifestyle leads him to a near-fatal heart attack in a packed courtroom. He quits his job, goes on a spiritual odyssey only to return to share his system with a younger lawyer (written through the eyes of the author). Through the book, we learn this system which promises to release the potential of the mind, body and soul, so as to live life with passion, purpose, and peace.\n\nThe book covers seven timeless virtues of enlightened living over 13 chapters. They include: Master Your Mind; Follow Your Purpose; Practice Kaizen; Live with Discipline; Respect Your Time; Selflessly Serve Others; Embrace the Present. This is not a book youd want to speed-read, but instead one youd probably want to be taking notes of. Having taken those notes, it is truly about application of what youve learned.\n\nRe-reading this book was bitter-sweet. I asked myself how my life has transformed since the last time I read it  at least eight years ago. I cannot but feel Ive fallen short  and wonder how much more my life would have transformed if I had only constantly applied some of the principles taught (Im not blaming or shaming myself here, but reflecting). All is not lost, since re-reading this book, Ive returned to my daily meditation practice at 6a.m. (not quite back to 5a.m. yet). As I write this, Im relooking at my notes  what should I implement next?\nBlending ancient Eastern spiritual wisdom and Western success principles, this tale provides a step-by-step approach to living with greater abundance, balance and joy. You will play bigger, show up more, be the success you have always been meant to be  but, like me, will you apply what youve learned? This book will transform your life for the better if you will only do.","summary":"Blending ancient Eastern spiritual wisdom and Western success principles","unixReviewTime":1436659200,"vote":null,"image":null}

This is a stand out with the heightened sense of adventure and mystery with the discovery of the secret staircase that leads Wilfred and Primrose into the chambers of the Woodmouce ancestors.  The underlying theme in this story is Midwinter which I think is a great alternative to Christmas and opens questions for kids about this holiday which is an ancient celebration.  I love the detailed maps and drawings that accompany the story and the little descriptions which fill in the corners of your mind while reading.\n\nI read this and other Brambly Hedge books to my kids who are 6 and 4 and they adore them, sitting quietly, listening intently through the book.  My 6 year old reads this book as well with some help from me. Vocabulary is hard in this story but the fact that it introduces new words not ordinarily seen in modern books is a bonus.\n\nThis is a wonderful book I highly recommend for parents to share with their kids.","summary":"Fabulous Sense of Adventure and Mystery with The Secret Staircase","unixReviewTime":1299888000,"vote":9.0,"image":null}

The story uses cliches an average of every third sentence throughout the book.  The writing had zero subtext, like the script of an after-school special. Nearly every sentence of dialog ends with something like \"...he said mischievously\", \"...I added thoughtfully\", \"...he whispered somberly\", \"...I blurted excitedly\". It wore on me after a while.\n\nI think self-improvement \"fable\" books can work well, if they are well-written.  Who Moved My Cheese and The Go Giver are written as stories and provide valuable lessons that I remember years after reading the book.  I think this book attempts that but doesn't succeed.  I read this book a few days ago and the lessons are already fading from memory. Here's the main point: take time to reflect, live your priorities, don't work too hard.  All the lessons are unoriginal and re-hashed, which admittedly is the case for nearly all self-improvement books.  However, if a book is going to remind me of concepts that are already well-known, I want it to be done in a way that keeps my interest more.\n\nI'll give it 2 stars instead of 1 because what I do admire is that the author was clearly not a trained writer when we wrote the book, yet he wrote it anyway and lots of people have read it and liked it.  That's a useful credential to have as someone who teaches how to identify and follow your dreams.  I'm guessing he pushed past a comfort zone (as he teaches) and did something that was important to him.\n\nI heard a 1-hour lecture by the author on Audible.  http:\/\/www.audible.com\/pd\/Business\/Extraordinary-Leadership-Audiobook\/B002V1A9BQ\/ref=a_search_c4_1_5_srTtl?qid=1410819013&sr=1-5  While I didn't like how this particular book was written, I do like his general teachings and speaking style.  Is this audio he comes across as authentic and interesting.  I think he has some free YouTube videos as well.","summary":"Story and writing style so simplistic that it was hard to focus on the lessons","unixReviewTime":1410739200,"vote":null,"image":null}

It's so stilted, so fake, so chocked full of needless attributions that even novice fiction writers know to avoid, not to mention two supposed friends who repeatedly refer to each other by first name in the course of a single, that it's really difficult to get through. The ideas, however, packaged as revolutionary and known only to a group of mysterious monks that the author's friend just managed to find in the mountains of India  are really just repackaged Buddhist teachings.

This isn't even-- there's a plot but no point. It's got very few words and it's very repetitive.\n\nThere are three bears. I can't tell if they're supposed to be Brother, Sister, and Honey or different bears. Well, given the 1978 copyright date, it's clearly pre-Honey, so it's just another bear who's wearing Honey's overalls. They go investigate a spooky old tree. It keeps saying, \"Do they dare X? Yes, they dare.\" And they keep going through weird things in this creepy house that's kind of like a haunted house and they get more and more scared. At the end there's a giant bear and they crawl over him and he gets mad and chases him, and then they run back home, and that's the end. There's no real point. Pretty much everything is interchangeable. The characters are interchangeable. The plot points could have happened in any order. It's really not very interesting and the author didn't try very hard in writing a story. There's not even any reason for them to be in this Spooky Old Tree to begin with.\n\nThe best part: when they climb over a giant, sleeping, naked bear. That would be equivalent to climbing over a large, sleeping naked man in their world. It's just a weird thing to do. And it reveals the whole exercise as home invasion.\n\nFor more children's book reviews, see my website at drttmk dot com.","summary":"Repetitive, overly simplistic pointless robbery book.","unixReviewTime":1478044800,"vote":null,"image":null}

I read it on holiday and began by expecting and hoping to read an insightful story. For the first few pages this seemed to be the case, however the book then changed direction.\n\nIn many ways the author of a book designed to help people change, what are often termed `self-help' books, faces a dilemma. For the help to be successful it has to be self-help, that is it has to come from within the reader. The use of stories or parables that awaken understanding in the reader derive their power in this way. However after reading the story the reader is then left with the question of what to do with this awakened understanding; how do they actually change?\n\nThe alternative approach is to provide a change instruction manual which prescribes changes in the hope that these then create change from which new understanding will follow. The danger here is that unless understanding is changed, the result is the mindless application of prescribed rituals, or the rejection of them.\n\nThis book attempts to bridge these two approaches. It begins with the story of a lawyer forced to re-evaluate life following a major heart attack. However this story quickly becomes a rather simple framework for what is largely a monologue describing a set of self-change techniques.\n\nAt the point where the book transitions from a story to an instruction guide I almost gave up on the book, but was later glad that I didn't. I found the pretext of the story strained almost to breaking point, but suggest that if this is overlooked the second half of the book contains some powerful advice for personal change. I did have the feeling of ideas collected together from elsewhere, but amongst them is a structure of practical changes that have the potential to profoundly change your outlook and achievements.\n\nThe measure of value of any such instruction guide rests not in what the reader is instructed to do, but in what the reader does with the advice. For my part, a little surprisingly, I have taken a number of the change suggestions and am applying them. The book therefore has had a greater impact than many.","summary":"Lessons on change.","unixReviewTime":1315008000,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

Swanwick","reviewText":"In \"The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,\" Robin S. Sharma clothes sound advice for spiritual and personal growth in a thin mantle of fiction that delivers much instruction but minimal entertainment. However, Sharma's fictional approach makes for an easy read and good retention of his key principles.\n\nSpiritual\/metaphysical content: The narrator spends one revelation-filled night with Julian Mantle learning the fundamentals of spiritual growth. Julian imparts everything he has learned from his time with the Sivana monks, cramming a lifetime of wisdom into their short time together. Sharma structures the lessons into seven chapters based on a short fable full of symbols. Each symbol represents a key idea from the Seven Basic Principles for Enlightened Living. Each chapter ends with an action page that summarizes the symbol, what you need to remember, and techniques to try, such as the Ten Rituals for Radiant Living.\n\nMy take: Sharma calls his book a \"fable\" in the subtitle, but it is both more and less than that. The fable part takes place in the opening chapters of the book, in which we discover that the hard-driven attorney has moved to India, become a monk, and after three years has returned to pass on his wisdom to his prot&eacute;g&eacute;. That's the extent of the story, and character development fares little better. As a work of fiction, the book leaves much to be desired.\n\nHowever, as a collection of easy-to-digest life strategies and pearls of wisdom, the book is quite satisfying. Sharma has organized the book around a short fable about a garden full of symbols (a fable within a fable), which makes it easy to understand and follow his 30-day plan to enlightened living. The give-and-take of dialog between Julian Mantle and his student rescues the story from the tedium of an instructional guide. If your primary goal as a reader is to quickly absorb the core of Sharma's life improvement teaching, then this book is a great place to start.","summary":"Short on story & long on instruction, but easy, rewarding read","unixReviewTime":1313366400,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

It was one of the first books that I read and recognized as spiritual fiction. The subtitle of this book is \" a fable about fulfilling your dreams and reaching your destiny\", and it truly is a fable and totally fictional. Initially when I read it I thought it was a true story until some of the things that happened to the lawyer Julian just seemed impossible to believe. I was really in the infancy of my spirituality at the time, however this story did get me hooked.\n\nThis fable is about a very successful lawyer named Julian Mantle who is stricken by a massive heart attack in the middle of a packed courtroom. One of his proteges, John, is there to witness the big man crumple to the ground, and the story progresses from there. The author provides you with a detailed background of the circumstances leading up to Julian's heart attack, and you are then fast-forwarded to Julian's return after several years of being away from the rat race.\n\nNot only does Julian survive the heart attack, he quits the law firm, sells all of his possessions (including his red Ferrarai) and travels to India on an \"expedition\" to become a monk. This explains the title of the book. When he returns he visits John and meets with him several times to explain his \"transformation\" and to explain the lessons that he has learned.\n\nWhen Julian returns, he is virtually unrecognizable to John. He is lean, tanned and calm. In fact the only evidence left of the man that he once was is a scar on his chest from the surgery he had as a result of his heart attack. Over the course of several meetings, Julian explains how he was transformed by a meeting with the \"Sages of Sivanna\". These \"Sages\" teach Julian many things and show him that life is much more than material wealth and possessions.\n\nThis is a spiritual fiction book and I have found it very easy to read and to keep interested in (I have read it four times). One of the things that I found unique (for it's time) was that it also includes an \"Action Summary\" and \"Julian's Wisdom In a Nutshell\" at the end of every chapter that has provided you with one of the \"7 Timeless Virtues of Enlightened Living\".  Many books today include a reader's study guide or group discussion outlines, however this was one of the first books I had encountered that did this in a fiction book.\n\nWritten in 1997, this book is just as relevant today as it was then. With all the hype about \"The Secret\" and the fiction book \"The Shack\", Mr. Sharma brought all of the lessons that they have been teaching into his book at least ten years before they became popular. I would recommend that you read this book, particularly if you have read similar books and you will see that learning life lessons can be enjoyable when combined with an interesting story. I also recommend \"Life Lessons From The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari\" and I deem it essential to own and KEEP \"Who Will Cry When You Die\", both by Robin Sharma. His latest book \"The Leader Who Had No title\" has a good message, however I was put off by the poor editing.\n\nPlease contact me if you have any questions or comments - I would love to hear from you.\n\nLaughter and love,\n\nRick Fess","summary":"\"The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari\" - Spiritual Fiction","unixReviewTime":1313193600,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

He has no occasion to stand a while to enjoy his achievements and material successes. He has no time to look inside of him. A near fatal heart attack in a packed courtroom gives him a pause and a spiritual crisis. He stops back to confront the condition of his life and seek answers to life's fundamental questions. He seeks happiness and fulfillment, which his high profile lifestyle seems to have eluded him so far.\n\n  He embarks on an extraordinary personal odyssey to the East, which brings him to the great Himalayan Masters of India, the repository of spiritual wisdom. His quest brings about the successful blend of spiritual knowledge of the East with the success principles of the West, which charts a course for living with greater courage, balance and abundant joy.\n\n  The book is brilliant and inspiring, full of pearls of wisdom.

The average adult -fifteen times\".\n\n\" The universe favours the brave. While you resolve, once and for all, to live your life to its highest level, the strength of your soul will guide you. Nourish your spirit. Do the things you fear.\"\n\n\"The best time to plant a tree was forty years ago......... The second best time is today.\"\n\n\"We are not human beings having a spiritual experience,\"\n\n\"Never be a prisoner of your past. Become the architect of your future. You will never be the same.\"\n\n\"The quality of your life will come down to the quality of your contribution.\"\n\n\"What lies behind you and what lies before you is nothing compared to what lies within you.\"\n\nThe book gives so many practical advices to lower stress and help the reader feel happier. Things like breathing deeply, living in the present moment, serving others and so on. The book is told as a fable, with the noble aim of improving the reader.\n\nChinmay Hota\nAuthor of 'Hits and Misses'","summary":"The Ultimate Quest","unixReviewTime":1288137600,"vote":null,"image":null}

These ideas are applicable to anyone's life. Following is a summary of what I learned from this book.\n\nWe may not be able to control the weather or traffic or the moods of all those around us. But, we certainly can control our attitude towards these events.\n\nChinese character for `crisis' is composed of two sub-characters: one that spells `danger' and another that spells `opportunity'. There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such a thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self mastery. From struggle, comes strength. Even pain can be a wonderful teacher.\n\nWorry causes your precious mental energy and potential to leak, just like air leaking out of an inner tube. All of your creativity, optimism and motivation has been drained, leaving you exhausted.\n\nSaying that you don't have time to improve your thoughts and your life is like saying that you don't have time to stop for gas because you are too busy driving. Eventually it will catch up with you. 80% of the results you achieve in your life come from only 20% of the activities that occupy your time.\n\nThere is a tremendous power in a ritual. Sports stars who eat the same meal or tie their shoes the same way before the big game are tapping into the power of ritual. If you insert any activity into your routine by doing it the same way at the same time every day, it quickly grows into a habit. For example, this technique can be used to incorporate health fitness into our  lifestyle. Similarly, any other good habit like reading for expanding one's horizons etc.\n\nVoluntary deep breathing is a very good exercise and is useful all the time. Sharma explains why. He says that breathing is normally an involuntary activity which goes on in the background. But, that background activity is good enough for survival purposes. It is not good enough for all the energetic tasks we want to undertake. Voluntary deep breathing helps us in stepping beyond our comfort zones, defeats fatigue etc. This is one good lesson which I found very useful.\n\nConfucius said \"Good people strengthen themselves ceaselessly\". Only a human being can step outside of himself and analyze what he is doing right and what he is doing wrong. Then set about making immediate improvements.\n\nIf you live every day as if it was your last, your life will take on a magical quality. I would like to pluck the following summary in Sharma's own words. You sow a thought, you reap an action. Reap an action, sow a habit, Sow a habit, you reap a character. Sow your character, you reap your destiny.","summary":"Very Inspiring Self Help Book","unixReviewTime":1260576000,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

When he suffers a life threatening heart attack he determines to put  the essential luxuries of purpose, peace and happiness back into his life.  He travels to the Himalayas and spends time with the Sivana monks, who teach him wisdom of life.\n\nThis book is chock full of simple habits and rituals to include in one's life to nurture your body, mind and spirit. The advice within is compellingly framed and concise, making use of symbolism to remember the key concepts.\n\nPicture the following sequence.  What can this mean?\n\nYou are sitting in a wondrous, beautiful flower garden.  In the middle  there is a red, six story lighthouse.  Suddenly, there is a creaking from the base of the lighthouse and out comes a 290lb Japanese sumo wrestler.  He is wearing a simple, pink wire cable sheath.  The sumo wrestler spots a shiny stopwatch.  He picks it up and immediately falls to the ground.  It appears that he has taken his last breath, when suddenly he comes back to life.  He then gets up and looks over at a beautiful group of yellow roses nearby.  Finally, he exits the garden by a path of beautiful diamonds...\n\nHow can you draw upon your deep reservoir of mental fortitude and inner strength that you possess?  As most accomplished people know, never stop learning and actively expand your wisdom about life.  As many great leaders do each and every day, take time out for reflection, including self-reflection.  To not do so is akin to being too busy driving to put gas in your (beautiful) car (you).  Awaken with the sun and cultivate a positive mindset and an attitude of gratefulness.  Savor the present.  Make music an integral part of your life.  Build your character by taking specific actions.  Simplify your life as much as you can for enhanced peace of mind.  Thus, you will leave time for the things that matter most.  Specifically, those things that will make the most difference in the long run.  Always cultivate your virtues of industry, compassion, humility, patience, honesty and last but not least, courage.\n\nThis little gem of a book is inexpensive.  It's entertaining.  It's a quick read.  It will be three hours of your valuable time very well spent.  You might learn nothing new.  Or, perhaps you will see your life more clearly than ever before.  Perhaps you will be pleasantly surprised and this book will unexpectedly improve the quality of your life.","summary":"Don't forget to put gas in your tank and empty your glass  : )","unixReviewTime":1214179200,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

There are many important lessons about what's really important in life. Is having a big bank account more important than peace of mind? Do fancy cars and clothes bring more happiness than spending quality time with your family and friends?\n\nI don't think there's any debate of the value of the message. Who couldn't put these admonishments to good use? I think the real challenge is practicing the techniques described. The book itself even advises that people need to stick with these techniques for at least three weeks till they become habit.\n\nOne thing that knocked the book a little for me was the cliches. For instance, the cliche of emptying your cup is used in this book. I've read this story of the master who keeps pouring tea into the cup till it's overflowing at least one hundred times. There were some other cliches used that I've also heard plenty of times. This made the book at times seem a little on the cheesy side and a bit unoriginal. Even with these caveats the book still has a lot of practical benefit. For these reasons, I think a person should pick it up if they're looking for inspiration or motivation in their lives.","summary":"What's Really Important?","unixReviewTime":1194134400,"vote":null,"image":null}

I finished this thinking that this is one of the best books I've ever read on how to live in this world. I was shocked at the amount of principles covered in this story. I just wasn't expecting what I got from this.\n\nI initially refrained from underlining and marking up my book because I thought I might want to loan it out. So, I took notes. I've since decided that I'm gonna read it again and underline the great parts I want to revisit. Just when I thought this guy had covered most everything, he pulled out even more! This is an awesome book.\n\nOkay, the other nice thing about this is each chapter ends with an action summary. I liked how this wraps up each chapter. So, you get the chance to think about what happened in the story, the points being made, and the great thing is it gives you the techniques.\n\nI read a few reviews where people were criticizing the story. I thought the story was good, with a few weak spots. But the story isn't the main point, it was just the vehicle to deliver the goods.\n\nI loved this book! This is one that I think can definately make a difference in your life. The thing about books like this is, usually people read it once, decide that there is something to it and maybe even make a few changes in their life and a little while later they slide right back into living the way they always have.

Julian's life was out of balance and his spiritual self is nourished with wise advice on joyful living by developing joyful thoughts, follow life's mission to reach goals, develop relationships fruitfully and live to satisfaction with courage and discipline, come what may! The book has most inspirational values and is a captivating story even Ricky Martin and Jon Bon Jovi seems to be a fan of Robin Sharma. A lawyer himself, Robin's book is a gem to touch and change lives to live in spirituality. However, it is never so important like the fable to travel delights through Himalayas for the sage advice. The main concept is to look within and live peacefully with spirituality within and take time out from the drowsy, monotonous life of materialistic world. Make life more meaningful and take a pause - a break (An Osho discourse!) A good Pick for a Read to Digest.","summary":"Spiritual Find","unixReviewTime":1086912000,"vote":null,"image":null}

A French Jesuit priest and anthropologist, Father Teilhard spent the bulk of his life attempting to reconcile his faith with the burgeoning science of the 20th Century - a science he believed in and practiced.\n\nThe Future of Man is a series of Fr. Teilhard's essays from the 20's through the late 40's of the 20th Century. Looking at the implications of population growth, atomic energy, scientific discovery and his own Christian faith, Fr. Teilhard espoused that humanity was on a continuous evolutionary process to reintegration with the Christ - or the Omega Point. The ultimate fulfillment of this reintegration is the Parouisa of Revelation, and the unification of the spirit of all living things in the Noosphere. The incarnation of Jesus showed the way to unification and reintegration of the perfected spirit of humanity.\n\nWriting as he did during a period of rapid change in the world, Fr. Teilhard predicted things like global communications, ecumenism and common welfare before their time as the natural evolutionary process from atoms to complex creatures to eventual divine perfection.\n\nHis writing is a tough read, and certainly isn't for everyone. I found myself reading and rereading segments to just try and get the message. The message itself, however, is a profound one and one of hope. A good read if you have the patience for it.","summary":"Revolutionary and Evoilutionary Reading","unixReviewTime":1369785600,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

Then of the alternatives that are offered we must choose the one which seems best able to develop and preserve in us the highest degree of consciousness. If we turn out to have been wrong in this, then the Universe has no less gone astray.\"\n\"But is it not in itself a consolation and a source of strength to know that Life has an objective; and that the objective is a summit; and that the summit, towards which all our striving must be directed, can only be attained by our drawing together, all of us more and more closely and in every sense---individually, socially, nationally and racially?\"\n\"The basic characteristic of Man, the root of all his perfections, is his gift of consciousness... But this power of reflection, when restricted to the individual, is only partial and rudimentary... Reflection can only be developed in communion with others. It is essentially a social phenomenon.\"\n\"In exploding the atom we took our first bite at the fruit of the great discovery, and this was enough for a taste to enter our mouths that can never be washed away: the taste for super-creativeness.\"\n\"(B)iological purposiveness ... is not everywhere apparent in the living world, but that it only shows itself above a certain level... Below this critical point everything happens (perhaps?) as though the rise of Life were automatic. But above it the forces of free choice and inner direction come to light, and from this moment it is they that tend to take charge.\"","summary":"MORE ESSAYS BY THE RENOWNED PALEONTOLOGIST\/PRIEST\/THEOLOGIAN","unixReviewTime":1280188800,"vote":9.0,"image":null}

His vision of Mankind grew out of his scientific researches and his religious faith and is essentially a synthesis of both . Chardin pictures the universe evoloving toward Man, and then with the coming into being of Man evolving in a new way in what he called the Noosphere. The evolution of Consciousness which could be conscious of itself was a vast upward moving process .In his words, \"One may say that until the coming of Man it was natural selection that set the course of morphogenesis and cerebration, but that after Man it is the power of invention that begins to grasp the evolutionary reins. A wholly inward change, having no direct effect on anatomy: but a change, as we now know, entailing two decisive consequences for the future. The first is an unlimited increase in the aura of influence radiating from every living being; the second ,even more radical, the prospect afforded to a growing number of individuals of being joined together and ever more closely unanimised in the inextinguishable fire of research pursued in common\"pp. 307-8 As de Chardin envisages Mankind's Evolution is moving toward some kind of ' single consciousness' He asks , \" May we not imagine that at that moment a truly and totally human act will be effected for the first time, in a final option- the yes, or no answer to God ,pronounced individually by beings in each one of whom the sense of human freedom and responsibility will have reached its full development? \" p. 321\n\nI am not sure what this ' vision' is, and how this ' end of mankind ' in consciousness of God will manifest itself. The vision by the way seems to me to parallel to one I am personally connected with that  of the great Jewish thinker of evolutionary redemptive development Rabbi Abraham Yitzchak Ha- Kohen Kook. I would too make one point about my own reading of the ' end of mankind'. I would ask of what good it is for all of us to be absorbed in some great vision if this does not mean that the ones we love, their personalities and lives do not individually live ?\n\nBut that is my question, and for those interested in a grand Catholic religious vision of the development of Mankind this book certainly is an answer.","summary":"The end of mankind is in consciousness of God","unixReviewTime":1100476800,"vote":35.0,"image":null}

Using fiction means never having to use footnotes yet still present a picture of computer workers and their lives. This 1995 book has seven chapters on its 371 pages. It begins in the Fall of 1993 and ends in January 1995. It tells about other events in that era. It is like a Web Log that records daily activity but does not go into details about Daniels work. Does this story tell something about it author? Does this book have any value for most people? No, I would advise a good murder mystery.\n\nDaniels father suffers from a cutback at work. [Every expandingbusiness reaches a plateau then a reduction in force.] His younger brother Jed in a swimming accident years earlier. [No details about this although Dan was present.] The story tells about their work pressures and schedules, their choices in diet, etc. The expect to be burned out or retired by age fifty. Then they hope to live in luxury (as long as their stock in Microsoft pays off). You can read between the lines to understand their work environment. What if their jobs are outsourced to a foreign country? Do they have a viable Plan B? Would forming a trade union help?\n\nBy Chapter 2 it become weary - those pages with large type for random words. Daniel earned $26K a year; was that a fair wage for a sixty-hour week? He was a tester not a programmer. This is just as important even if a lower skill set. The designer is the most important, like the writer of the script for a movie. All depend on a financier to provide funding. They work on games, a non-productive use of resources that entertains and doesnt educate. Is America running out of telephone numbers (p. 79)? Was this due to poor design (the use of 0 or 1 for area codes? The importance of Lego is the correlation to an age level and a preference to constructing a whole from simple parts. Remember Lincoln Logs? Or is that like IBM Hollerith cards?\n\nThere is more padding (pp. 104-105). Daniel and his friends migrate to California for a new business opportunity (Chapter 3). The differences are noted. [This is before the current drought.] Are its referenced dated like slang from the 1940s? George Orwells novel 1984 warned against the thought control of Big Business. One example is the foolish talk about clothing stores in Chapter 5, they are oblivious to their brain-washing! Chapter 7 seems to be tacked on for its sensationalism. It ends with a sudden attack of sickness, then sentimental feelings. Will their product be a success? For what length of time? Eventually the users will drop it for another toy. What is more fickle than fashion, and those who profit from creating changing tastes?","summary":"A Parody of Computer Workers?","unixReviewTime":1428537600,"vote":null,"image":null}

This is fiction that tries to give the reader some kind of feeling for working in computers in the early 1990s. Geeks think and behave differently than most people, and Coupland and this is the first work of fiction I've read from the point of view of a geek. He gets into some interesting stuff with Bug having to define his own identity late in his life; this turns out to be a good thing, because if he wasn't gay then he could have kept going on in his life without ever having to evaluate himself as a sexual being, just being carried by a crappy inertia. An issue to which Coupland returns throughout the book is how now we have less free identity. In some neighborhoods every house is different, and kids playing hide and seek with their friends might have secret crevasses no one knows about. In other neighborhoods there are a handful of moulds for a house, they're all made out of the same material, and perhaps you get to choose what color the living room walls will be and whether you have hardwood floors or carpeting. Being able to follow an existing belief system takes a huge amount of mental burden off you. The writing is sprinkled with cute bon mots like, \"I don't even deserve the honor of calling myself carbon-based, let alone silicon-based-- maybe I'm based on one of those useless elements like boron that don't do anything.\" Part of why I liked this book so much is probably because it's about a second phase of having to define yourself firmly as an adult in your late 20s or early 30s, after the initial phase of self definition that happens in adolescence (and perhaps another one in between in the early 20s), and I am myself in my late 20s...","summary":"Gives a feeling for an era","unixReviewTime":1359158400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Not your final frontier in this instance, but there's lots of it here and its not a bad deal.\"\n\nThey are a subspecies of the homo sapiens. They're weird, wacky and wonderful: the geeks, who dwell happily amongst us and help keep society humming along. Douglas Coupland addresses the geek pride in an unusually cheerful little novel focusing on a workplace gang of geeks  (like a flock of birds or pride of lions) known as \"microserfs.\"\n\nIt's in diary form (interspersed with big quotes, web addies, and bits of code), by a young man named Dan. He and his pals work for Microsoft, and their jobs dominate most of their lives (despite this, he does get a girlfriend). Despite the machine-dominated jobs they have, these \"microserfs\" decide that they want personal lives and reinvent themselves.\n\nIf you own a computer and use it for something slightly more advanced than playing solitaire or checking the football scores -- like many members of the population -- you might like \"Microserfs.\" In fact, enoying it is almost a certainty if you talk about Legos, eat flat foods, and ask questions like \"Is our universe ultimately digital or analog?\"\n\nOne thing that might put off some readers is that Coupland sprinkles the diary entries with seemingly random stuff -- aPzroc, burnt arborite, Champaign-Urbana, countless ones and zeros, two pages filled with the word \"money.\" But it's cute, funny, and somehow it adds to the real feel of the geekiness of this novel.\n\nBut it isn't just cute -- the characters are pleasantly well-rounded and likable, and while Coupland's books often have a sort of sad feeling, this one is relatively cheerful. Even so, while pointing out the problems with a geek's life, he explores the dimensions that show that they people too, and the poignant moments are among the best in the book.\n\nGeek pride! I enjoyed reading about the \"Microserfs,\" a unique facet of Douglas Coupland's vision of the world.

Now it seems more ironic.  Many of those for whom this was an accurate depiction of life in the 1990s are still caught in this time warp.  The tragedy is that so many others have joined them.\n\nIf you have not already read this novel and wondered about the design of a working world in which human interaction through technology has largely replaced direct human interaction: the time is right.

Coupland has done a good job of blending the two approaches.\n\nThis book subtly shows the absurdity of corporate life. The main protagonist, Dan, works and goes home to sleep. The house where he lives has a changing array of roommates, so much so that no one bothers to decorate the common areas. Coupland does a good job of portraying this sort of grinding existence. The small rewards given for getting a product out on time are accorded an almost mythical status. The relationships between people at the office show the tension and the fun that can be had by people thrown together by job choice. Later, when most of the major characters leave to join a startup, the reader sees the stress and toil that is added on top of the crushing workload in such enterprises. As before, Coupland also shows the characters having fun and relating to one another. He does what an author is supposed to do, which is to tell the story and let the reader make the judgments.\n\nCoupland manages character development very well. All of the characters are quirky nerds. A lesser author would not have been able to make the subtle differentiations that Coupland does. Dan is a lovable loser. Karla is a Trekkie whose parental resentment seethes just below the surface. Abe is desperately trying to escape a life of nerddom by spending all his free time at the gym and bedding all the women he can. But, as the story moves along, these characters grow and mature. It is not a jarring change; but at the end of the book, the reader marvels at the differences in all these people. It is a testament to Coupland's ability as writer.\n\nA couple of parts in the book rang false. The twist at the end felt tacked on to show how far the characters have come and look at what a big, happy family they are now. Dan's family and his life back home could also have been handled better.\n\nStill, this is a worthy addition to the canon on books about work and toil. If you know anyone who works for a faceless corporation, they will laugh and cry at the situations presented here.","summary":"Working for the Man is tough","unixReviewTime":1191110400,"vote":null,"image":null}

I consider this somewhat fortunate, because for me he was simply an author and nothing more or less.\n\nI'd decided to go back and read Coupland's earlier work.  That started with \"Life After God\" (which I liked quite a bit) and then continued (sometime later, actually, because all leisure time was erased for me for certain personal reasons) with \"Microserfs.\"\n\nAs you probably already know, the plot involves ex-Microsoft employees who go off on their own to develop a virtual Lego program.\n\nThat's about the most you can say for a plot.  \"Microserfs,\" written as a diary of one of the coders, is a bundle of ideas and thoughts and theories.  Similar to \"Life After God.\"  But while those ideas resonated with me, in \"Microserfs\" I couldn't always identify with the characters.  I could also see why there was a little hostility toward Coupland.  Occasionally the ostentation in this book is suffocating.  He's writing about self-confessed geeks, but there's an undertone of \"I'm smarter than you, hipper than you, I know more than you, and I am a pop-culture God.\"\n\nThere's a feeling of emptiness for me with this book.  We are essentially stuck with a bunch of uber-smart super-geeks who have the emotional maturity of five year olds.  Would you want to be with these people?  Personally, I don't think I would.  They're smart, and sometimes very funny, but often you want to tell them to just shut the hell up already.  At some point you wish their concerns were more substantial than cereal, \"Star Trek\" and name brands.  Part of the point is that they've isolated themselves so much they haven't experienced much in the real world, but their self-obsession can become tiring.\n\nThe more fascinating issue is the time this novel captures -- that a-computer-in-every-home period when Bill Gates was still a mythical genius, and the Internet (which is actually dismissed here) started to change our lives.\n\nThese characters are so emotionally void that it's hard to truly get to know them outside of their obsessions and obvious issues (religious parents, closeted homosexuality, etc.).  Also, each character -- all of whom want a \"life\" and feel lonely -- progress along the same lines and discover themselves in the same way: namely by finding someone of the opposite sex (or in one case of the same sex) and falling in love.  It almost seems ironically simple: you're alone, you have no life outside of computers and math, so the easiest way to discover happiness is to find someone who's exactly like you who you can have intercourse with.  Hey, maybe world peace is around the corner...\n\nSo why do I give this book four stars?  Because Coupland is so incredibly talented that even a semi-misfire like this is anything but boring.  Throughout this book he will make you laugh, and he will reel off some little bon mot that will have you smiling and nodding your head in recognition.  Unfortunately, the book is just a bit too long and a bit too overpacked with this chatter.\n\nThe lack of a plot forces Coupland to dash some seriousness onto an otherwise frivolous tone and roll out one of the most sentimental endings I've ever read.  It felt very awkward to me, but maybe it's appropriate for such a diffusely written novel.\n\nI didn't enjoy this nearly as much as Coupland's other novels, but I'm not disappointed to have read it, and I look forward to reading its pseudo-sequel.","summary":"A glance into the past.","unixReviewTime":1168560000,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

That warm feeling of nostalgia you get when a book so successfully transports you to a time when life was full of surprises which you thought of as mere routine, and things were more exciting than they seemed, and you were happy and clueless about everything.\nYears have gone by, and looking back you can see how strange routine was, and how the cynicism of then was tame when compared to the cynicism of now. Being transported back to then gives you hope for the now, and the comfort of open arms that will hold you, and of a mouth that will whisper into your ear \"There are things that you must remember.\" It's almost supernatural. My skin crawls.\nI'm not a coder, never was. Never worked in the Silicon Valley. Lived there during the time this book takes place, but never was friends with people that remotely resembled the people this book tries to characterize. But, ah, the zeitgeist! As said elsewhere...this IS the zeitgeist. It is the zeitgeist made flesh through words. Coupland is less talented than this book allows us to conclude, but Microserfs is just sublime, and one of my favorite pieces of writing ever.\nIt reminds me of old videogames; empty outlets in the middle of the desert; sleepwalking through part of a technological revolution; warm microwave ovens; trashy sci-fi TV shows and Saved by the Bell reruns; clever toys that time forgot; Taco Bell restaurants; ancient DOS manuals; dusty floppy disks; healthy junk food; slow days; the golden age of Vallco Mall in Cupertino; riding Bus 81 in San Jose, and the Caltrain from Santa Clara to San Francisco; buying Lucasarts games at Fry's Electronics...All of these things, which are particular to me but might be common to you, come together along with others I'm not brave enough to mention, when I'm reading Microserfs. So this really IS the zeitgeist. The feeling of being there again takes over me so violently it's physically noticeable, even though I shared only very few of the characteristics of the people pictured in this book. But I was there, and felt what Coupland has put on paper.\nMicroserfs is a powerful, touching, sad, happy, wonderful time machine. Read it along with Game Over, by David Sheff.

Those who came before us will forever be daunted by technology; those who came after take it for granted.  Only my generation embraced technology with a passion that became a lifestyle, and Microserfs may well be one of the first book to take into account the extent to which our professional and personal lives were impacted by this force.  Through Microserfs, Coupland has breathed life into the cold, isolated, socially-inept stereotypes that dominated the worldview of techno-buffs.  Yes, we may be awkward and more comfortable coding than throwing parties, but by god we have fun doing it!\nI was recommended this book by a friend who lives half the world away whom I met on an online message board.  I was reading it through my long-distance, internet-inspired courtship with my now fiance.  And through it I see my friends, my job and my life.\nCoupland certainly can sling the geek, but he can also inspire tight, warm knots of nostalgia through his many pop-culture references.  Coupland also has a knack of writing incredibly human characters, rivaling Robbins in the quirky details department, through occasionally some characters (such as the body-building duo Todd and Dusty) feel more like caricatures.  But what I probably appreciated most from this book was the topic of \"Geek Love\", as some reviewers have described it.  Coupland definitely struck out new territory on this topic, which was probably good news for some of the geeks out there who were in need of a handbook on the subject!\nReading Microserfs is like having a conversation with a really good friend - warm, comfortable and easy.

I've been a computer geek since childhood and have worked at dot.com startups and videogame companies. I've experienced both the highs and the lows of this realm: from the elation of being part of a hit product to the lonely, grinding monotony of twelve-hour days in front of a computer screen in interminable crunch mode. It's clear that Coupland has some personal experience with the demographic he's writing about, the young, brilliant, socially compartmentalized 90's tech worker (AKA geek) trapped in an unfufilling career, trying to invent a better existance. Via the journal of the central character, Dan, he lovingly brings to life the geek mind, with all its ideosyncracies, obsessions, and tangential ponderings, and frames it with an abundance of 90's pop culture references.\nThe characters are fun, quirky, and bear more than a passing resemblance to people I've known in real life. Coupland engineers enough drama, friendship, and events among the close-knit cohorts to keep the reader turning the pages, as well as plenty of thoughtful, apparently off-the-cuff musings about the effects of technology on modern life, and the book is really a breeze to read. I suggested Microserfs to several non-geek friends, and they enjoyed it greatly.\nThe book does have its weaknesses, though. For one, it's obvious that Coupland is an outsider when it comes to computer technology, which gives some of the book's plot points a false ring. The average reader probably won't notice, but the average Wired reader just might. Also, he sometimes tries to invest his characters with a little too much geek cred, which makes them unconvincing at times (or hard to tell apart). Maybe I don't know enough female techies, but Dusty and Amy seemed particularly unlifelike.\nStill, I give Microserfs a thumbs up. It's an easy, fun read, and captures the overall spirit of a particular subculture (as well as its angst) at an unique moment in history. It would be interesting if Coupland wrote a \"ten years later\" sequel and we could find out where his characters are in their mid-30s, in the present day (their Lego project probably would have been a failure in the real world).\nIf you like this book (or if you are a geek who was disappointed with it), I highly recommend \"Hackers\" by Steven Levy, a spirited account of the real life computer geek world from the 60s through the early 80s. Levy brings the early computer industry alive in a way that's even more fascinating than fiction.","summary":"An endearing time capsule of 90's geek life","unixReviewTime":1056412800,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

It is written by Douglas Coupland, the Canadian author best known for coining the term Generation X.\nThe novel is narrated in the form of a journal (which in itself is appealing to me) penned by the main character, Dan Underwood (26). To set the scene, the journal starts in the fall of 1993. Underwood serves as a computer programmer for Microsoft. The entertaining plot revolves around the misadventures of he and his fellow code-crunching computer whizzes. These self-professed 'geeks', obsessed with lego, and who often lament their lack of a social life, board together at a Microsoft \"dorm\".\nOtherwise known as \"microserfs\", they spend 16-hour days coding, eating \"flat\" foods (ie. Kraft singles or fruit rollups, which are often passed underneath closed doors), and checking\/sending email. Seizing the chance to be innovators and wanting to escape their Bill-run world, this intrepid bunch of quirky coders strike out on their own, as they form a high-tech gaming software company named Oop! located in Silicon Valley.\nSpanning about 2 years, the novel lends us the complex and often hilarious story of what it's like for these coders, living together in a sort of digital flophouse as they desperately try to \"get a life\" and find love amid the dislocated, subhuman whir and buzz of their digitally-driven world.\nI find Coupland's wit modern, funny, to-the-point and often thought-provoking. The novel itself is comical, illuminating and ultimately poignant. Indeed, literal tears welled up at the conclusion, which was an unexpectedly touching one. Admittedly, it is not a novel I would recommend to just anyone. Yet it is definitely a novel I personally wouldn't want to do without.","summary":"take a walk on the geek side","unixReviewTime":1053388800,"vote":null,"image":null}

Not your final frontier in this instance, but there's lots of it here and its not a bad deal.\"\nThey are a subspecies of the homo sapiens. They're weird, wacky and wonderful: the geeks. Douglas Coupland (he who wrote \"Generation X\" and \"Polaroids of the Dead\") introduces us to a gang of geeks (like a flock of birds or pride of lions) known as \"microserfs.\"\nIt's in diary form (interspersed with big quotes, web addies, and bits of code), by a young man named Dan. He and his pals work for Microsoft, and their jobs dominate most of their lives (despite this, he does get a girlfriend). Despite the machine-dominated jobs they have, these \"microserfs\" decide that they want personal lives and reinvent themselves.\nIf you own a computer and use it for something other than solitaire or checking the football scores, you might like \"Microserfs.\" Certainly if you talk about Legos, eat flat foods, and ask questions like \"Is our universe ultimately digital or analog?\"\nOne thing that might put off some readers is that Coupland sprinkles the diary entries with seemingly random stuff -- aPzroc, burnt arborite, Champaign-Urbana, countless ones and zeros, two pages filled with the word \"money.\" But it's cute, funny, and somehow it adds to the real feel of the geekiness of this novel. But it isn't just cute -- the characters are pleasantly well-rounded and likable, and while Coupland's books often have a sort of sad feeling, this one is relatively cheerful. Even so, while pointing out the problems with a geek's life, he shows that they're people too, and the poignant moments are among the best in the book.\nGeek pride!

But as soon as I started it, from page 1, rather than the 50 pages it took me to get into the Thomson, I was hooked.\nCoupland is the voice of our generation, whatever our generation is: the first group of people to work with computers. This book is a codification of that heady feeling. It praises geekdom, while also shining a blinding white light at the superficiality of this most materialistic culture. It also gets underneath the surface of high tech low-lifes (and I don't mean the cyberpunks--these are the geeks, the ones who stare at a monitor all day and all night, who never have time to make the score as a Gibson character) to show that even they are still human. Even geeks love. If you prick them, even they bleed.\nThe cultural references here are overwhelming. I predict in the future people will use this as a nostalgic device at parties. You can pull up almost any page and find enough brand name and object references to stun even the most jaded of computer nerds. To finish it off with, Coupland here explains his concept of Lego as the ultimate geek toy, something he has elaborated on recently in Wired magazine.\nThis is not just for those people who wonder what life as a Microsoft employee is like. While Coupland captures the feeling for a certain segment early in the book, it is only a portion of what he's casting his net for. What he is really trying to do is show you what life for the young, computer literate college-aged is like, where the world is your oyster, and you prefer pizza.","summary":"It will be dated, but that will only increase the nostalgia","unixReviewTime":1048464000,"vote":null,"image":null}

In creating them, what are we doing to ourselves?  If and when an artificially intelligent being comes into existence, what will it be like?  And if processed cheese is 80% milk, what's the other 20%?\nCoupland's novel deals, in a speedy but probing style, with an array of fascinating questions like these.  The major characters are incredibly smart and rather zany computer programmers, so they offer interesting thoughts on these questions.  Though they never conclusively settle these questions-- except the one about cheese [\"non-milk additives, of course\"]-- their hypotheses alone make the book worth reading.\nAdditionally, they strive to make lives for themselves beyond the sea-foam green walls of Microsoft.  These attempts are especially pertinent to Coupland's Gen X readership as it begins to settle down.  Of Coupland's works, this one easily rates among his best.  If Generation X hadn't been so groundbreaking and scored such a major cultural impact, I would probably argue that Microserfs is Coupland's best.  However, Microserfs is probably destined to be Coupland's most brilliant little-known work.  A must-read for: Gen Xers who think they need to get a life, people in the high-tech industries of any age, Coupland fans, parents of computer programmers.","summary":"Giant Ideas and Little Slices of Life","unixReviewTime":1018224000,"vote":null,"image":null}

They talk about completely random things, such as what programs pet animals would write if they could.  Each character also voices their personal opinions on the purpose of life throughout the book.  These odd bunch of friends start their \"lives\" (in the real world) influenced by the Microsoft-cult-culture.  Their lives revolve around work (usually past midnight and even on weekends) and sleep (they all live in the same house close to \"campus\").  Naturally an event such as a close-friend's proposal to start up a new company and recruit them as \"equity partners\" (aka employees) throws them off balance and threatens the humdrum existence and pseudo-harmony they've come to expect as employees in Building Seven on the Microsoft campus.  That's where the adventure begins for these people.  Moving from Redmond to Silicon Valley, they set up shop in Daniel's parents' home in the Valley.  From here, the book turns into a coming out party of sorts.  Dan's dad is having a midlife crisis after having been laid off by IBM.  Bug comes out of the closet.  Dusty gets pregnant.  Michael falls in love.  All these happen while they're trying to come out with a product they can showcase in the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas.\nThis book is unnerving in some sense.  It is able to accurately capture what many people in the hi-tech industry are like -- their habits, propensities, worries and fears (even their \"language\").  But it falls short in certain aspects.  The storytelling was at times uncoherent and lacked a fluid story-telling aspect.  It got too bogged down with the philosophizing.  And at times, it felt like writing for the sake of writing.  I particularly disliked the ending however poignant.  My thoughts as I finished the final pages were \"That's not fair to the reader!\"  I was referring to the whammy of Dan's family tragedy.  I couldn't find any reason as to why that was added except to reinforce the randomness and cest la vie attitude of this book.\nThis book is so random.  If you like to read what \"geeks\" have in their minds, then this book is for you.  If you prefer to read a story with a real plot about what the dot-com world is like, I would highly recommend Startup by Jerry Kaplan instead.","summary":"Ramblings...","unixReviewTime":1015027200,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

I was worried that it would seem outdated, that somehow a geek was different ten years ago than they are now.\nI am proud to say that this is not the case.  Coupland's story of a young man working as an insomniac bug-checker at Microsoft is beautiful in its ability to show the true inner hearts of people (like myself) who are often almost totally closed off from other people and who are searching for love and meaning in this crazy world.  In fact, the actual \"techie\" side of the book is almost secondary to the inner workings of Daniel's (the protagonist's) mind and heart, as he and his friends set out on a journey to find something better and find meaning in their lives.\nThis book touched me, not with a bang, but with a whisper.  I usually like books with a bit more... well... schizophrenia, but this book is to those others as a Japanese painting is to pop art.

After about fifty pages, I found the sophomoric metaphysics and self-important view of programming to be more than a bit self-indulgent.  It's totally Gen-X centered, but I guess that figures, given that Coupland introduced the term in another book.\nWritten as a diary, it follows a programmer for Microsoft who uproots with his group house gang and moves to the Bay Area.

As you get older, the bottom line becomes to survive as best you can.\" -\"It's your world now... it's yours.\"\nDouglas Coupland is popular with my generation, most likely because he makes keen observations about life from a perspective people of the X Generation can understand and relate to. Heck he must be the expert since he coined the term \"Generation X\". However, he also must appeal to the ME ME ME IT'S ALL ABOUT ME self-centredness that is a part of the nature of most people of this generation. Also it must appeal to their short attention spans and complete irreverence toward just about everything. I recognise that this is a generalisation, and I am not condemning Coupland nor his fans. I am simply saying that Coupland's writing style is idiosyncratic and definitely has one target audience. I read his earlier works, and I enjoyed them more or less, but there is a quality to Coupland's writing that seems very surface and artificial despite his astute and timely observations about people and things. Coupland is genuinely witty in his writing, but most of the time I find that he tries too hard. What I mean by this is that he overreaches for authenticity. For example, in Microserfs, he writes about how he went shopping at the Uwajimaya on 156th in Bellevue. Locals will be impressed that he knows his stuff and people from outside of the greater Bellevue\/Redmond\/Eastside area will be impressed with his knowledge, or maybe his imagination if they don't know that Uwajimaya is really on 156th in Bellevue. The problem for me, though, is that these little things just go too far by a tiny amount that just push these references right over the thin line of what is clever and what is trying too hard. Maybe just Uwajimaya in Bellevue OR Uwajimaya on 156th. Either\/or but not both! Just too many offhand refences to places, landmarks (like the now-imploded Kingdome) and local \"things\" to prove he had actually done his homework or something. I know some people were very impressed by that level of detail, but I found it, once again, artificial.\nCoupland writes Microserfs like a journal and brings up many interesting points, like how Gen X parents expected their company to take care of them forever and in exchange the employees gave unwavering loyalty. Gen Xers think of almost all jobs as temporary stepping stones to something else. Interestingly, most of what technical talk Coupland included is all pretty out of date considering that the software industry moves like lightning. Most of the interesting observations come in the beginning of the book when the main character is still working for Microsoft. Most of Coupland's references are so dead-on with regard to Microsoft culture and life, which is probably why most Microsofties read it and like it. However, when all the employees move to the Bay Area to work at a start-up, the book completely loses direction and all sense of coherence.\nThe narrator, Dan, discusses his co-workers and their quirks, discusses how he does not understand what exactly the \"Information Superhighway\" is supposed to be and goes off on a tangent about how major freeway construction died around 1975. He notes that only foreign employees at Microsoft seem to smoke, and it is not a surprise that user-friendliness is a West Coast American concept. Later in the book, the observations deteriorate to Dan reporting what his friends have said, such as the reasons why breakfast cereals are \"decadent\" or Karla and other characters discussing how their Barbie dolls had sex lives.\nYes the book explores the ever-searching nature of people born in this generation, yes the book examines the culture of Microsoft and can be painstakingly funny in doing so, and yes the book is readable. Is it great? Is it a classic? No. It can be read in a half day for fun, and that should be all you read it for.","summary":"YES, WELL, YOU GEEKS ARE AN ODD BLEND OF DOORS AND BRAKES.","unixReviewTime":992131200,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

It's not perfect:  The plot takes a little while to get going, and there are some gimicky  moments (2 whole pages of binary code, pages without vowels).  The story  sometimes seems to barely scratch the surface of the characters' lives and  emotions, glossing over the missing depth with relentless pop culture  references and relying on Big Moments - birth, cancer, coming out - to let  us know we should be feeling for the characters.  But those very flaws are  a part of the book's post-MTV-generation style, full of quick cuts, potent  images and Pop-Up Video factoids.

Coupland uses the diary technique extraordinarily well,  focusing on mood, relationships, how Silicon Valley works, and a range of  interesting observations as he sees fit.

Back then, Coupland wrote it as a short story (I think) and then later expanded  on it as a book. Interesting that back then, what he described as '386  droneware' was, in the book itself, to become '486 droneware'. I guess  writing needs to be upgraded too!\nAnyway, I liked Microserfs a LOT.  However, my favourite part is still the first chapter, that first original  story. The book, on a whole, is whimsical and funny. Coupland's mastery of  imagery seems to have developed from his earlier novels and here it's  excellent. I don't consider this to be his best book (unlike many) although  it's certainly the most attractively accessible. This is standard Doug  Coupland - mid 20s people searching for identity and their place in the  world. Here, they just happen to be computer programmers.\nUltimately, a  fine book, 'classic Coupland' and a good introduction to his (our) world.","summary":"Technobabblewit","unixReviewTime":915062400,"vote":null,"image":null}

In other words, the novel is stuck in the-life's not fair supplication which, inevitably has no reward except to lead to a redundant and circular chase of our own tails.  Quite frankly, it wears thin after a while, which is not to say that Coupland will not produce something of better quality in the future, its just saying that his present, while appropriate to his creative development, is a repetitive whine.","summary":"Intelligence in a spin of cynicism","unixReviewTime":902707200,"vote":null,"image":null}

The British Are Coming!\n\nNo, his book is not about the \"War\", rather it's a superb mystery\/thriller brilliantly written by British author Robert Goddard.\n\nBeatrix Abberley boldly confronts an intruder in her home and is brutally murdered.  What is so bizarre about this heinous crime is that the dialogue suggests that she was actually expecting the perpetrator and she knew what he was going o do and why he was going to do it. We soon find out that weeks before her murder she asked a confidant to mail four preaddressed letters to four different individuals in the event of her death. These letters will contain the reason for her murder and will reveal who the murderer is. Charlotte Ladram, Beatrix's niece, doesn't have long to mourn the murder of her elderly aunt when she is involuntarily pulled into a tangled web of betrayal and lost loyalties. As she enlists help from a most unexpected source she discovers a twisted connection between her aunt's brutal murder and a long lost secret from the Spanish Civil War.\n\nHand in Glove is part mystery, part thriller, part police procedural (although Goddard convincingly finds a way to tone down the necessity of the police). The characters are wonderful. They are lively, exciting and jump right off the page. They have distinct personalities.  As I read each page I felt as if I were standing right there watching all the action and listening to their dialogue.  Which brings me to my second point, the dialog is fresh, natural and incredibly engaging; never stiff or boring, and the author uses it expertly to shape the characters and move the story along at a good clip. The plot is well formulated. There is something here for everyone. Every nuisance is covered, every action brings new revelation.  And Goddard's research is implacable. He has given us keen insight into an interesting historical period.  HAND IN GLOVE is all that you expect a thriller to be and more. Goddard masterfully proves that fiction can go beyond mere entertainment and can inform and enlighten (as well as delight) readers when written well.  One caveat...towards the end of the book, as the plot begins to unravel and secrets are revealed, the events and characters get a little complex. Stay with it, all will be settled in the end.\n\nThis is a superbly written novel!  I am looking forward to reading Goddard's other titles.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nCris Cunningham for Amazon.com","summary":"Couldn't Put This One Down!","unixReviewTime":1152316800,"vote":18.0,"image":null}

While her skill at writing is largely responsible, so too is the time she takes to develop the characters before the \"mystery\" takes over.\nThis novel is a good illustration of that. Inspector alleyn doesn't enter the picture until halfway through the story. By then, we are as immersed in the personal lives, feelings, and thoughts of the characters, as if we were actually on scene. This is all the more amazing for the economy of words that Ms. Marsh employs. Here there are none of the tediously long descriptive passages that plague many an author who strive to be critically acclaimed.\nThe story takes place in a small village.

She has never come close to matching Agatha Christie's devious and ingenious talent for  misdirection - not to mention her popularity - yet she is a far better  writer than Christie.  Her characters have depth and her dialogue is sharp  and witty, albeit perhaps a bit too British upper crusty for some tastes.  She chooses very interesting settings (as in \"Died in the Wool\") and  milieux (as in \"Artists In Crime\") and describes them well - to the point  where on occasions the atmosphere and mood provide half the pleasure of  reading the book.\nIn \"Hand In Glove\", the tranquility of Pyke Period's  English country house is disrupted by the discovery of his houseguest's  body in an open ditch.  Harry Cartell was the victim of an ingenious trap  that could have been laid by any of half a dozen characters, whose  backgrounds range from highly suspicious to above suspicion.  Many secrets  and many motives, but the narrative never generates confusion in the  reader, only a mystification that is very gratifyingly unraveled by  Roderick Alleyn.  The clue on which the mystery turns - Pyke Period's  misdirected letters - provides one of those \"Aha!\" moments that mystery  readers so often long for, but so seldom get.\nI am a practiced reader of  detective stories and while I find most of Marsh's mysteries to be  enjoyable reading, I do not find them particularly mystifying - I'm usually  able to spot the guilty party in the early chapters.  However, in \"Hand In  Glove\" she very adroitly pulled the wool over my eyes, while playing fair  every step of the way.  This is a well-told story with a cast of plausible  suspects, deft narration and excellent misdirection while presenting all of  the clues fairly.  A fun ready, and one of Marsh's best mysteries.","summary":"One of Ngaio Marsh's best mysteries","unixReviewTime":964483200,"vote":17.0,"image":null}

Neither of them seemed to have any kind of personal life (except of course, Watson and brother Mycroft for Holmes and Hastings for Poirot). No family, friends, love interests (though people have speculated on the Holmes\/Watson connection)or any kind of emotional life. Inspector Alleyn is of a different breed. Yes, he's a professional, but he also has a personality outside of being \"the Handsome Super,\" as the newspapers like to call him. As does his faithful sidekick, Inspector Fox, who, though not as clever as Alleyn shows a level of intelligence well above that of Hastings or Watson. In _Hand in Glove_ Marsh sets a murder against the backdrop of a village primarily occupied by the nobility. Indeed, no one would even dream of murder tainting the house where Messrs. Pyke Period and Henry Cartell live. But when one of them ends up having his skull crushed and multiple motives come to light, it is up to Inspector Alleyn to point the finger at the guilty party. This is probably the most skillfully woven Marsh mystery I have read to date.","summary":"Finally, a detective who seems real","unixReviewTime":961113600,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

What I like:  all of his books are present day, but centered around a mystery from a recognizable event from the past.  In the case of Hand in Glove, a mystery from the Spanish Civil War reaches out from the past to embroil modern day characters in a mystery that threatens their lives.  So we end up with a story that in order to save people's lives, the characters have to try to sort out events from the past with little clues to go off of.\n\nThe mystery serves up the standard lot of suspects and while the endings are never too much of a surprise, the process of getting there is satisfying for history buffs. As seems to be the case for most Goddard books, Hand in Glove starts off strong and then weakens in the final third of the story....I'm not sure if that is because he tries to string the story out too long (his books average 600 pages or so) or if he just loses interest as the goes, but it seems to be a pattern for his books.  The strength of the first portions of the stories, however, make them worthwhile reads. I'll certainly read more of his novels, but suggest them as a library read.","summary":"Mysteries based in the past","unixReviewTime":1341705600,"vote":null,"image":null}

This in itself would be an interesting tale told by another sort of author--along the lines of William Trevor. However, when an entire book is based on a premise that the expiring royalties from two very slender volumes of poetry are enough to incite murder and kidnapping in this same clan--whose daily expenditures seem more in the realm of Rupert Murdoch\/Richard Branson--the plot wheezes improbably along until at long last resorting to a rapid, highly improbable and sensational tabloid-style conclusion.\nI liked Goddard's \"Found Wanting\" very much, written c. 2008, so perhaps \"Hand in Glove\" c. 1992 is just an early and less accomplished effort and I simply expected more by reading chronologically out of order.","summary":"Implausible tale of willful ignorance and murder","unixReviewTime":1313452800,"vote":null,"image":null}

I would not have thought they were an American reader's cup of tea!\n\nAnyway, I have become so disappointing with his works in recent years that if I feel like a fix of his tortured plots I now just read some of his first books.\n\nThis novel was first published in 1992. It has all the usual elements - a mystery from a few generations back that envelop surviving relatives, an international dimension that brings in foreign travel*, a bringing together of unlikely characters who usually start out as enemies and become friends and a cast from Goddard's version of central casting which includes the usual weak hero or heroine, cardboard bad guys and assorted bit players.\n\nThis basic plot worked for a while in books like \"Into the Blue\", \"Borrowed Time\", \"Take No Farewell\" and to an extent \"Hand in Glove\" and then fizzled out.\n\nThat may sound like a rather cynical account of Goddard's works but it is based on my reading of almost everything he has written.\n\nSo if you are new to Goddard, choose these earlier works and avoid his later books.\n\nThe basis of this story - the murder of the sister of an English poet who died during the Spanish Civil War allegedly to obtain the copyright on his poems - is unconvincing.\n\nOf course, there is a greater mystery afoot and Goddard unravels it via trips to various parts of southern England, Wales, the United States, France and Spain. It is a reasonable read but be prepared for stilted dialogue, one-dimensional characters and a roller coaster ride.\n\n*Including the usual caricature foreigners. In this book for example, a Spanish thug who holds a knife to an Englishmen's throat smells of garlic while a Frenchman phones his wife and when she answers says: \"Ma Chrie, c'est  moi.\"","summary":"Same old Goddard","unixReviewTime":1299974400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Heiser","reviewText":"Not everybody appreciates essays, and that is fine.  If you just want a very dry and clinical historical study of a ubiquitous pair of artifacts, then you'll be disappointed.  This is a reader's book, written for literate people who enjoy reading for the sake of reading. From that point of view, it's an elegant little work. It is similar to \"Catapult: Harry and I Build a Seige Weapon,\" which I also reviewed, in that the journey is as much a part of the story as the purported subject.  Why did the author choose this subject, how did he research it, what were his stumbling blocks and triumphs, and what was he experiencing about the project.  It is almost a meta-essay, in that it is an essay about writing an essay.\nRest assured that it does cover the history of screws and drivers fairly comprehensively--it even explains the origin of those squareheads that you can get from McFeeley's.  I was positive that those were the same things that the trailer manufacturers were using back in the 70s (just to 'broach' the subject).  Now I know for certain.  I had no idea that the Canadians had been using them throughout the 20th century.\nOne of the interesting discoveries of the author is that very little scholarship has been performed in this area, so some of his findings probably represent original work.\nI'm always interested in where things came from, and even more so in WHY they came.  Rybczynski gives some reasonable explanations for possible first uses of screws--both as fasteners and as transportation devices.  He also discusses the most relevant technology--thread cutting, including pictures of some early thread cutters and he highlights the development of standardized threads and automated thread cutting lathes.  (Just before receiving this book as a Christmas present, I had seen a working model of DaVinci's screw-cutting machine at an exhibit in the Zrich Landesmuseum--this device is depicted in Rybczynski 's book and looks just like the model.)\nIt is a very short book, and it is an unusual approach to a technical history that is apparently a turn-off to some people.  I enjoyed it.  I think if you enjoyed the catapult book, Kurlansky's treatise on cod, or are a fan of John McPhee that you will find this book a worthwhile read.  Witold Rybczynski uses a totally different style than the dry and thorough analysis of Petroski (see my review of \"The Pencil : A History of Design and Circumstance\").","summary":"Enjoyable essay, but not a lengthy industrial history","unixReviewTime":980380800,"vote":7.0,"image":null}

Much of the filler is interesting but Rybczynski struggled hard, and wandered far, to find enough words to fill this very slim book (probably only 20,000 words).  Since less than 10% is about the subject, the substance isn't quite enough for a solid magazine article. I wanted, and expected, more.  I'm sure Rybczynski's editor did, too.

It has to do, in part, with screws and screwdrivers, not very exciting or even interesting themes on the face of it; but there is much more to this slender volume than just that. The genesis of the book was an assignment from an editor at the New York Times to write an article about the best tool of the millennium. Eyeglasses were, in Mr. Ribczynski's estimation, the most important tool of the period; but the editor was not interested in appliances or technological innovation, but in simple tools: the things one holds in one's hand to do, say, carpentry. Thus came the notion to the author (prompted by his wife) to consider the screwdriver and the screw as the premier tools of the millennium.\nThe printing press, the wine presses, lathes, water elevators, on and on the parade of practical helixes related to the screw (both in the last and previous millennia) is displayed in this little book. Well planned, extremely precise (as the screw itself should be), scholarly, and containing many explanatory line drawings, the book is a joy. I think that Henry Petroski's book \"The Pencil\" opened the door to this kind of writing: a commonplace, relatively insignificant object is brought under microscopic scrutiny as to its history and evolution; what emerges is a magnified picture of not only the object itself, but of mankind in its eternal struggle for small perfections. This book, in its own way, is one of these small perfections.","summary":"A Small Perfection, by fermed","unixReviewTime":970704000,"vote":null,"image":null}

All in all, it was well worth the time spent.  I  think you will feel that way too, unless you have no interest at all in  mechanical devices and the process of innovation.  My favorite parts  related to the innovations.\nThis book is composed of equal parts (1)  why the author chose the screwdriver as the tool of the millennium for his  article in the Sunday New York Times Magazine (2) where you have to go to  find out about screwdrivers from the past (3) how he developed the  information for this history of the screwdriver and screws and (4) the  geniuses who developed the key advances in the technology of these useful  devices.  The style is a bit rambling, much like what would happen if you  were chatting about the subject over a barbecue in the back yard with  plenty of time on your hands.  I can assure you this must be the most  complete and authoritative book about screwdrivers and screws ever,  especially since the author points out the virtual absence of any prior  material turning up in his research.\nLet me summarize the key areas.  He  picked the screwdriver as the tool of the millennium not because he thought  of it, but because his wife told him that it was the one tool that she  always kept around.  After having gone through his own tool kit, he had not  even thought of the screwdriver.\nThe first place where much shows up on  the screwdriver in older texts is Diderot's Encyclopedia.  In those days  screwdrivers were called turnscrews.\nTo get a flavor of the screwdriver  in the middle ages, when it seems to have appeared, you have to look into  armor and early guns.\nThe screw goes back much further, showing up in  useful form for Archimedes in Greek times as a way to raise water.\nScrews later played many other important roles, especially in presses  (including, of course, printing presses).\nLathes turned out (pun  intended) to be an important related technology for making screws precise  and consistent.\nI learned about some interesting related technologies,  including Greek mechanical devices with gears for calculating the orbits of  heavenly bodies.\nThen, we finally get down to gears and the development  of improved lathes and the Robertson and Phillips screw heads.  He prefers  the Robertson (which I had never heard of before) which uses a socket top  to screw in and remove screws.\nAt the end is a nice set of  illustrations along with a glossary of tools.\nThis book is probably  going to be a classic Father's Day gift for decades, along with a Robertson  screwdriver, socket set, and screws.\nOvercome your misconception that you  know all you need to know about screwdrivers.  You'll be pleasantly  surprised by this gentle and unassuming book.\nWhen you are done, pick  something else you think you probably know enough about and search around  to find a good book on that topic as well to expand your own knowledge  further.  Keep doing that, and some wonderful learning awaits you!\nDonald  Mitchell (donmitch@irresistibleforces.com)","summary":"Screw Up Your Courage and Dive into Screwdrivers!","unixReviewTime":967420800,"vote":72.0,"image":null}

Edelman","reviewText":"Witold Rybczynski is an architect, a historian and someone who is deeply interested in the details, the history, and the origins of the world we live in- our homes, our cities, real estate developments form the time of George Washington, and now, the humble (or so it would seem) screw and screwdriver. He begins his quest by looking in his toolbox and noting that the same general types of hand tools that might have been used by a carpenter around the previous turn of the Century were well known to the Egyptians. He divides these tools in four categories: Measuring tools ( rulers, straight edges, plumb bobs, level), saws, wood shaping tools (chisel and plane), and fastening tools- hammers and nails (the Egyptians used pegs rather than nails, as did most carpenters prior to the 17thC.).  The screw as a machine is an ancient idea; Archimedes was said to have devised a helical screw pump for raising water, but the screw as fastener didn't come about for several centuries after Archimedes's time. But the idea of a screw fastener was a long time in coming, since making screws by hand made them an expensive item. You can find handmade screw fasteners on a Medieval knight's armor, but the modern, interchangeable, standardized screw required a new kind of machine- the screw cutting lathe, which itself relied on a precise, carefully engineered screw turned by yet another machine. (The reader might think as this point that we have a problem of infinite regress- if it takes a screw to make a screw, where did the first one come from?)\n\nThis is a short book- only 151 pages, including illustrations. Yes, it's a history of the screw and screwdriver, but it's also an extended meditation on tools, hand work, and the rise of the machine, and how it changed all of our lives. It begins in Ancient Egypt, comes forward to the time of the great Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19thC, and then, curiously, does an abrupt turn and finishes with the most ancient mechanism known to mankind- the Antikythera Mechanism, an ancient analog computer of the first Century BC. The result is a charming and fascinating book that entertains as it educates.","summary":"The history of technology in a simple device","unixReviewTime":1347840000,"vote":null,"image":null}

But what about the history of the people who made the tools that made the tools that made the heroes?\n\nAs the year 2000 approached, Witold Rybczynski was tasked by an editor with writing about what he felt was the tool of the millennium. He ran through a list of great inventions until he hit upon the screwdriver. Just where did it come from? What were its first practical uses? Back through history he went, through the drudgery of handmade screw manufacturing, the socket-headed screw and even the story of Henry Phillips and his famous Great Depression invention. That's the one that boatbuilders claimed proved to be thirty to sixty percent more effective than any screw they'd used so far. He traces screwdrivers through several languages. In French it's the tournevis. In German, the schraunbendreher.\n\nWhile the earliest mention of an actual screwdriver is found in fifteenth century literature, the concept of the screw retreats through Roman and even Greek times. The Romans, while they never had screw and screwdriver technology, certainly had bolts, nuts and screw presses. But they stole the idea from Archimedes, the Father of the Screw, in the words of the author.\n\nWhere would Coast Guard history have been without the screwdriver and screw? It's an interesting postulation. But had the screw and screwdriver never been invented, the boatbuilders and other engineers that made the tools that made the heroes would never have known what they were missing.","summary":"The Tool that Made the Tools","unixReviewTime":1233100800,"vote":null,"image":null}

The screw is responsible for holding our doors up, keeping our planes flying, making computers work and a host of other jobs too numerous to mention. Of course, the screw would be of little use to us without the ordinary screw driver.\n\nThis book is a fascinating look back at the history of the screw, which traces itself back to Archimedes' time and the screw driver, which allowed the screw to be used for so much more than the relatively simple jobs once delegated to it.

That's a tall order and requires a good amount of thought by itself, but the answer to that question--the screw and screwdriver--provides a wonderful journey through various arcane references.  Indeed, Rybczynski finds an error in no less a reference standard than the Oxford English Dictionary.\n\nThough the origin of commonplace objects can seem somewhat arcane, the sheer enjoyment of scholarship is evident in his book--Rybczynski does not take shortcuts and is as fine a craftsman with his words as he is with a builder's tools.

This book is a valuable addition to my collection.\n\nIn this book, the author makes a good argument for the screwdriver being the most important tool invented in the last thousand years. It seems like such a simple invention, yet he demonstrates via good research the importance and discovery of the screwdriver. He makes a less-well researched claim to the history of the screw.\n\nMany tools that we commonly use are much more ancient than the last millennium-the hammer, axe, plane, and so forth are ancient tools, well developed in Roman times. Yet the screw and screwdriver, essential today, are fairly new, developed during the late middle ages or early renaissance periods.\n\nOne of the best parts of the book is chapter 5, where not only reveals the 'first' screwdriver, but information on Henry Maudslay, Jesse Ramsden. Joseph Whitworth, Joseph Clement, Richard Roberts, and James Nasmyth, most of whom I had never heard of before. Maudslay and this small group of mechanical geniuses were the people who 'invented precision' as another writer put it. In other words, this group devised the machine tools required for precision work. They are mentioned in this book because a lot of their work revolved precision screws, their use and manufacture.\n\nThat's one of the things that I like about this kind of history. One good book can lead to an area of discovery and knowledge that the reader might not know about.

His object was to write an essay on the topic for the New York Times.  On his wife's suggestion he settled on the screwdriver and then scoured museums and libraries for its provenance.  The book, however, is not primarily about screwdrivers, but about this research and ultimately about the screw itself, which after all gave rise to the screwdriver, and about some of the machinery such helical devices enable.  It is the author's feeling that the screw represented a leap of inspiration rather than a logical development based on previous devices.  It may be that using screws to fasten objects together was a genius move, but in fact shafts with helical threads were earlier used in various machines where considerable pressure needed to be generated, such as oil and wine presses and their offspring.","summary":"An informative evening's diversion","unixReviewTime":1117584000,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

The history and connections he presents are sometimes quite interesting, but it seems his notes needed a lot more editing and illustration.\n\nFor example, the division of material into chapters seems arbitrary and not particularly helpful. The narrative is choppy in many parts. One is not sure where he is going with his assorted findings of references to screws through the ages. He jumps around, back and forth, delving in the 1700's, then the middle ages, then the 1800's, then Roman times, then to the 1500's...it's quite confusing to follow the thread, if there is one. I don't think the author took the time to reflect on all he had found and tell a clear story of it. Rather he revels (understandably) in the fun and frustrations of researching the material.\n\nHis assertion that the inventor of the screw was clearly a mathematical genius is not very convincing. Yes, the helix is elegant. But as his evidence makes clear, the screw probably started out as an ancient, very simple and crude tool and evolved from there. Just because some mathematicians like Hero describe it mathematically doesn't mean he invented it. It may not even be accurate to say the screw was invented--after all the shape of the screw is found in nature. There is just a history of increasingly inventive and optimized uses of its shape.\n\nThe author did provide enough information for me to observe that that the evolution of using screws seems to have gone through three main phases:\n\nIn the first phase it was used as the primary part of a large tool, such as a method of moving water or lifting heavy objects. They were often crude and made out of basic natural materials.\n\nThe second phase saw screws being made smaller and being integrated, not as fastners, but as parts of more complex tools, such as lathes, as well as toys, weapons and watches, where the screw help proper other parts. These required more precise screws made of separately manufactured materials, such as metal alloys.\n\nThe third phase saw screws being used not to move things, but as as stationary fasteners. Here it would have been particularly interesting to read more about why manufactuers chose to use screws vs. rivets, nails or other fasteners depending on the different applications and materials to be fastened. But the autor does an interesting job exploring the evolution of screw head types, such as flat-head, Phillips and Square socket. Also, once screws began to be used as fastners the challenge of manufacturing them seemed to go from inventing ways to make them smaller, more precise and more durable, to manufacturing them faster to feed ever-increasing numbers of assembly lines, construction workers, handymen, craftsmen, hobbyists, and do-it-yourselfers.\n\nOne could also say that perhaps screws have entered yet another phase as being objects of art and history. The use of the term in English vocabularly has certainly evolved colorfully.\n\nThese phases overlap overtime and continue in tandem. In each of these phases, one could have logically sub-divided information about how they are used in each scenario (tool, part, fasteners, art, etc.), their specific design features, how they were made and out of what, how they were optimized for each use over time and famous examples of there use.\n\nI would have liked to see better use of illustrations in the book. The few that were included could have been better placed. A timeline would have been very helpful. A richly illustrated introductory chapter exploring how screw-like features are found in nature (e.g., the helix, certain animal joints, etc.), would have been great. Also, how wonderful it would have been to show a chart (perhaps on the inside covers) of all the diversity of screw heads and screw types that we now have side-by side, let alone illustrations of all the different kinds of tools for screwing and and removing screws.\n\nSo there are bits of the book that I found interesting, and others that I found frustrating. At best, I think the book is a hodge-podge of sometimes interesting trivia about the history of the screw. Considering the author's point about how important the screw has been to enabling modern civilization, a more organized, analyzed and illustrated treatment would have been warranted. I can't imagine the author had a lot of time to spend on this project, but I wish he could have spent more.\n\nAll said, a mixed review is the best I can offer. Your level of curiosity will determine how desirable a read it is.","summary":"Interesting stuff, but a bit dry and disorganized.","unixReviewTime":1042934400,"vote":7.0,"image":null}

Instead, the author takes us on a rambling walk through the toolbox.  We learn not only about the development of many tools and machines (adze, augur, hammer, lathe, gears and presses), but about the scientists and inventors, even financiers, who contributed to the development of the screwdriver, and the applications (early firearms and clocks) that helped (literally) shape the device.  We learn about the Phillips versus the Robertson screw, and the limitations of earlier lathes, which led to the first screws being handmade.  Many interesting facts like this entertain and inform.\n\nAs a librarian I appreciated the author's friendly discussion of the references he found useful for his research.  There are many black-and-white line drawings to help you visualize the items being discussed, as well as a notes section, a good index, and illustration credits.\n\nWeaknesses:  I would have liked to have read a brief discussion of the (seven?)

The result is a non-chronological treatment that can be a bit confusing; and although structured as a detective story, using hints from obscure books and museums to trace a path steadily farther back into history, the materials in the last chapter -- on the use of screw devices in the ancient world -- are actually the most commonly known and available.

Rushton","reviewText":"This is an interesting and good book, but not what I wanted.\n My expectation was for a story along the line of Michael Faraday's 1861 classic, \"The Chemical History of a Candle.\"  Instead, this is a Lake Woebegone style of pleasant and relaxed wandering among dozens of anecdotes about the development of the common wood screw into an everyday item.  Granted, it's an excellent book,  Rybczynski is a charming writer who is able to discover and present pleasant little anecdotes about screws into a full length book.\n It's really a social history.  He wanders through the history of tools from ancient Egypt to modern power tools;  his description of the evolution of the hand saw which dates from at least 1,500 BC in Egypt is a fascinating account of how technology develops in response to a social need.  Rest assured, anyone who has even the slightest interest in hand tools will find every page fascinating.  Like James Burke and \"Connections,\" Rybczynski is a master story teller who is able to link diverse elements into an always interesting account.  About the only item mercifully missing is the thumbscrew  --  the old instrument of torture.\n \"One of the rewards of building something yourself  --  a house or a bookshelf  --  is the pleasure of using tools,\" Rybczysnki writes, setting the delightful theme of the book.  \"Hand tools are true extensions of the human body, for they have evolved over centuries of trial and error.\"\n One of the charms of the book is the questions that Rybczynski raises but does not answer, such as his assertion, \". . . . while most of us would bridle at the suggestion that if Cezanne, say, had not lived, someone else would have created similar paintings, we readily accept the notion that the emergence of new technology is inevitable or, at least, determined by necessity.  My search for the best tool of the millennium suggests otherwise.\"\n That issue is raised on page 110,  and again on the second last page of the 143-pages of text, when he talks of an invention \"that owes its existence to human imagination rather than technological evolution.  And imagination is fickle.\"  It's an idea worth keeping in mind;  Rybczysnki clearly comes down on the side of human ingenuity, the ability to come up with new ideas that may take time to find a practical application.  On this basis, he suggests Archimedes  --  who, like Leonardo da Vinci, was able to come up with dozens of ideas that were far ahead of the technology of his era  --  is the true father of the screw.  Interest, if true.\n Such thinking reflects the weakness, and also the strength, of the book.  Cezanne is certainly unique, but so is every snowflake.  The absence of a \"Cezanne snowflake\" doesn't prohibit the creation of other equally artistic snowflakes,  the key element is the science of snowflakes and not the genius of a seen or unseen snowflake.  Likewise, the key element of Cezanne was the artistic and social milieu in which he painted.  The Cezanne's who lived in a different era vanished without a trace.\n Technology is similar.  While the invention of a specific item may be the product of individual genius, it's adoption is determined by necessity.  Who knows?  Perhaps Archimedes also invented the can opener.  It didn't become popular, though, until the can was invented.\n This debate is what makes the book fascinating.  It is more than a study about the origins of an everyday item, it is also an exercise in questions, thought and ideas.  Rybczynski's charmed writing makes it a delight on both counts.","summary":"The best tool of the millennium","unixReviewTime":984268800,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

I bought the book because Matilda de Braose is one of my ancestors, and I was interested to read about what her life may have been like.  I really liked the different take on the historical novel, weaving a modern day suspense novel with historical fiction.  The modern day heroine, Jo Clifford, could be quite exasperating, and it was hard to understand why she continued her relationships with the men in her life, who all mistreated her.  But the suspense aspect of the modern day story mixed with the unfolding of the historical story really kept me turning the pages.  I recommend this for historical fiction fans looking for something a bit different.","summary":"Modern day suspense mixed with historical fiction","unixReviewTime":1415836800,"vote":null,"image":null}

I have only recently re-read it having just read the latest novel by Barbara Erskine  The Darkest Hour. Lady of Hay is every bit as good as Id remembered it to be and I can see why it started my fascination with time slip stories.\n\nJo Clifford is regressed to a past life when she is a student as part of a research project. Fifteen years later  now a hard hitting journalist  regression to past lives is a subject she decides to examine in a series of articles. Can she stay objective and analytical about a subject which could affect her very strongly? In the present Jo must decide which of the in her life can be trusted and she is not someone who responds very well to warnings or good advice.\n\nThis is a tension filled story with many ramifications in the present and the past. Old enmities have survived eight hundred years and need to be worked out in the present once and for all. It is a long book  over eight hundred pages  but the story is so compelling it will keep you reading. It is not a book to be read in the house on your own late at night as it will makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end.\n\nIf you enjoy mysteries with a difference then try this  or any of Barbara Erskines other novels and short stories.","summary":"Lady of Hay","unixReviewTime":1409443200,"vote":null,"image":null}

I love this book. Ive been reading it every couple of years since 1997 (In fact, I read it until the pages fell out of my paperback. I have a Kindle edition now). Publishers Weekly says What slows the narrative is the bevy of minor characters, Jo's acquaintances. They talk to her and about her, they try to help her and they conspire against her, all at the expense of the central plotline. I think the minor characters serve to make this a rich story with more depth than you often find. They form the world around the main characters. I fall in love with Tim every time.

It is a suspenseful novel full of mystery and historical facts about the Welsh culture, specifically the story of Matilda de Braose of the 12th Century, also known as Moll Walbee (1). It is intense, long, enriched with details, tedious at times but you really  get to enjoy the novel. You never get bored. Her life will mainly revolve around three men who so ruled her life: William, the king, and Richard de Clare.(2)\n\n(1) Erskine, Barbara (2010-10-01).

Lady of Hay: Two Women, Eight Hundred Years, and the Destiny They Share (p. 447). Sourcebooks. Kindle Edition.\n\nThe author used quite a complex medium of narration, I must say, to invite us to the life of Matilda. The main character, Jo submits herself to a series of hypnosis where she is regressed to her previous life. The theme of reincarnation takes full meaning in this novel. Despite my carelessness on these various themes [hypnosis, regression techniques, and reincarnation paraphernalia], I really enjoyed the historical part of this novel. Even if you don't really care, nor is invested into reincarnation, as me,\nthe splendid work done by the author on the historical part is outstanding. The novel is therefore multilayered and complex.\n\nI definitely will be reading more novels from this author.\n\n[* Spoilers alert!]\n\nMy complaints:\n1. I felt the end was rushed.\n2. The author never really explained how Sam knew all along who he was in Jos past life.\n3. I quite did not agree that Nick represented King John. In my opinion, Richard de Clare was a better choice.

She is given an assignment to investigate regression hypnosis, which is a technique that claims to access a person's memory of a past life. Jo initially pooh-poohs the idea, until she becomes a subject herself.\n\nAt that point, the medieval story takes off.\n\nI am not alone in finding the medieval story more compelling, primarily because the stakes are so high, giving Ms. Erskine opportunities for building a spine of tension to hold up the story arc.\n\nThe modern part of the story was not interesting. The relationship between Jo Clifford and her on-again, off-again boyfriend Nick went round, and around, and around, and while true to life, this spinning of wheels meant that many opportunities for tension were lost.\n\nNick's brother Sam is cast as the mad scientist, and as a former scientist myself, I wish that Ms. Erskine had eschewed the cliches and dug deeper to have formed a more interesting character. Sam's motivation is not clear, except that he seems to have gone quite mad for no apparent reason. My question was how did we get from the concerned young man we glimpsed in 1970, to the out-of-control sadist in 1985? No satisfactory answer is given.\n\nThe modern story deserves 3 stars, the medieval story deserves 5 stars, so I am giving this novel 4 stars.","summary":"A wonderful medieval tale with a not-so-strong modern frame","unixReviewTime":1374019200,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

The characters are compelling by themselves, but when placed into this particular story they become entrancing.\n\nMs. Erskine was very thorough in researching the material for this book, and the descriptive details were wonderfully enchanting. The only place I feel she slipped a bit was in the way the historical characters spoke, occasionally using the word \"hey,\" which was not introduced into common language until several hundred years after the historical portion of the story took place. And for all that Lady de Baorse was a trailblazer, I still found it a bit challenging to reconcile her attitude and how on the one hand she spoke to men - particularly the king - as if they were equals, and on the other hand she would talk about the duties of women being to submit to their husbands and acknowledging that they were owned by their husbands just like a horse or an item of clothing. But much of that can be forgiven and understood since the Lady de Baorse was being channeled by a modern-day woman who wouldn't be afraid of men as women of the 1200's would be, since women were chattel and only used to gain necessary alliances and such.\n\nThat hiccup aside, the story is riveting. All the main characters are strong forces on their own and combined together they become a volatile mix. Even the secondary characters have a surprising depth not often seen in a character that may only be in two or three scenes in the entire book. Just when you feel that the story arc is beginning to drag, you are whisked back in time to relive the extraordinary life of Matilda, otherwise known as the Lady de Baorse. However for the majority of the book the story moves right along at a lovely clip.\n\nIf you have an issue with wanton alcohol consumption be forewarned, as I'm not sure if there is a single scene in which either alcohol or coffee is not consumed - and often the coffee contains alcohol. Also, Jo comes across as having a rather loose moral code when it comes to sex, but I much of that is driven by the historical portions of the book oddly enough.\n\nThis book is perfect for those who enjoyed such books as 'The Other Boleyn Girl,' 'The Virgin's Lover,' and other books that take historical periods and their more well-known people and try to recreate what their lives might have been like. While that may sound like a simple romance novel it is clear the hundreds of hours of research that goes into the creation of the top-shelf books of this genre. And there is no doubt in my mind that this book belongs up near the top-shelf with the others, though it is not in the same league as the Diana Gabaldon's \"Outlander\" series. Definitely a challenge to put the book down and get anything else done until I finished reading it. Thankfully it is a fairly quick read, regardless of its size.","summary":"Superbly Entertaining & Educational too Boot!","unixReviewTime":1363737600,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

I love good historical novels. I have some first hand experience with hypnotic regression. I usually love novels written 20-30 years ago. But not this one. It managed to annoy me on many levels.\n\nOne could excuse the repeated violent rape scenes, including one perpetrated by the hero, as being characteristic of the 1980s when this book was written, as that was a time before women had finally figured out that a man who says \"I love you\" and then perpetrates a violent rape belongs in prison, not in your bed.\n\nOne might even excuse as characteristic of the 1980s is the fact that all the protagonists in the story behave like alcoholics, downing what we now would consider volumes of drink that would be diagnosed as binge drinking in just about every scene set in the present.\n\nBut one one cannot excuse the ridiculous way in which hypnosis and past life regression are presented in this story and the silly way that everyone including supposed medical professionals encourage what would be in real life a psychotic reaction in the heroine.\n\nThe heroine herself is Too Stupid to Live--the classic dumb heroine who, when warned not to go down into the darkened basement while a killer is on the loose and the power is out, always goes into the basement. If you enjoy that kind of story you'll love this one. If you like your heroine to be slightly brighter than a guinea pig, save your 99 cents and download something else.\n\nThe worst part of this book is that the writer has enough of a command of style to get you reading this bloated, endlessly long book. So that it isn't until you've gotten more than half way through that you realize just how stupid the plotting is. If you keep reading after that you are rewarded with a completely unbelievable and emotionally unsatisfied ending.\n\nFurther complaints: The book claims that the history that lies behind the endlessly dull past-life story is well-researched, but any author who puts bubonic plague into a story set in the last decades of the 1100s has NOT done their research. Even in the days before Google mildly educated people knew that the plague first appeared in Europe in 1348.\n\nIf the book had swept me into an emotionally moving story I would have easily overlooked the innaccuracies, but the emotional interaction between the main characters is wooden and we never get into their heads or feel their reactions, both in the story set in the present and the one in the past. Both are static, with no character undergoing a hint of growth anywhere. The characters are the same on at the end (which felt like page 9000 by the time I got there) as they were in Chapter 1. How this book got to be a bestseller in a world that produced Outlander a few years later is beyond me.\n\nPerhaps you had to read it in 1985 to love it, since there do seem to be many readers who did. But reading it in 2012, I certainly didn't. Between the rape scenes and the endless boring interactions between dull English people living what must have been considered a glamorous life in the mid-1980s this book struck me as one that should have remained a fond memory.","summary":"A colossal waste of time","unixReviewTime":1356912000,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

There is an interesting unexpected twist in the romance, and you're not entirely sure who is going to win out in the end or why.\nThe not-so-good? - The characters were too inconsistent and unrealistic.  If the characters are actually the same people from the past why did they change so much as soon as they began to remember?  Also, the present dilemma was nothing more than dealing with the stress of remembering the past. It would have been nice to see a parallel story in the present (aside from the romance) that had more to do with modern reality but somehow reflected the past.

It took me about 5 days to read it and at times, the narrative dragged and became very repetitive and I found myself wishing that I could just get to the end.\nAs tragic and gripping as Matilda and her son's death scene and other passages was , I sighed in relief when I came to the last page.\nI feel the story would have been better told if the book was about 200 pages shorter.\nAs a last positive note,I'm very glad that this book was written because I feel that it exposes Matilda and her story\/horrific fate\/ to a large and continuing audience that would likely never hear of her otherwise.\nLord knows that a woman and her son being thrown into a dungeon and starved to death on the direct and deliberate orders of a monstrously cruel King should never be forgotten. The suffering of both , both physically and mentally, before death finally came must have been unbelievable.\n\nPS- To any history buffs- while this book is based on real people and events and is basically accurate, one should be aware that there are events that by the author's own admission never occurred , such as Matilda's great love affair with a handsome,dashing nobleman(who also really existed), others are the pure speculation such as Matilda's rape by the same king that would later order her death- King John.\nIf using such devices to \"spice up a story\" and speculation about real people and events irks you then you should definitely stay clear.","summary":"Haunting, Gripping but falls short of perfection","unixReviewTime":1320537600,"vote":null,"image":null}

This book is nothing like that and the unexpected, unpredictable nature of the plot was a pleasant surprise.  That said, this isn't a very easy book to read.  Matilda is treated like a means to an end during many parts of her life and virtually all the men in her life either let her down or subject her to violence.  Since we, to some extent, expect that from the distant past, those parts are easier to read than the parts where Joanna - the woman in 1980 who is experiencing Matilda's life - goes through the exact same treatment from the men that she knows.  What she experiences is bad.  What is even worse is the casual attitude that everybody has about it (\"What happened to your face?  Did he hit you?  Too bad.\").\n\nThe book is fascinating and the author does a good job of setting up the parallel stories, as well as how Joanna is compelled to go forward even when she knows it is dangerous for her to continue regressing.  It is a little odd how everybody is so connected (\"Oh, let me tell you about this person you can go visit who will know stuff to help you), but that is overlookable.  The book does drag at parts, though it is difficult to determine what could have been cut out.\n\nWhat you get in this book is a very enjoyable and well-done story (that will take you at least a few days to read!).  Parts of it are very graphic when it comes to violence against women, specifically intimate partner violence.

It is well plotted and the characters are well developed.\n\nWhile those characters are certainly all too human, Sam is probably one of the snarkiest villians I've read about in recent months. Of course, there's the argument -- was it all planned by Sam in his evil, twisted mind, or was he really William? Was Nick really King John, or did Sam really do a number on Nick via hypnotic suggestion? Was Jo just an impressionable woman, hoisted on her own petard of vivid imagination and a love of history, or was she really a reincarnation of Matilda?\n\nEach reader must make his\/her own decision.

Hartness","reviewText":"\"Lady of Hay\" was an interesting dive into the world of hypnosis and some would say, time travel.  The story uses the theory of hypnotic regression as well as the concept of reincarnation to support the plot.  I myself am not a believer in either of these psychological\/spiritual ideas, so my approach to this novel was that of a time-travel fan.  I saw our main characters not as reincarnated, but as people whose minds seemed to be alternating from 1985 to the turn of the 12th Century.  I'm sure this wasn't the author's intent, but it enabled me to enjoy the story.\n\nJoanna is a feisty young writer, researching the topic of hypnotic regression for an article that she's putting together for an English publication.  Through her research, she finds that she seems to be inexplicably tied to Matilda de St. Valerie, born in 1160 AD and wed to William de Braose in 1174.  Other friends and associates in her life also seem to be linked to citizens of ancient England.  Through hypnosis, the past and the present begin to intermingle, leading to life-or-death situations for some of the main characters.\n\nOriginally released in 1986, \"Lady of Hay\" went on to sell over 3 million copies.  This is not surprising to me, as Erskine weaves an interesting and compelling tale.  I enjoyed the frequent alternations between past and present, as well as the various struggles that characters went through in the different time periods.  There was suspense, romance, mystery, and a dynamic plot that pressed on with consistent energy until the conclusion.\n\nAs a non-believer of reincarnation, I wish the story could have been told in another way.  I think one motivation of using reincarnation is to give characters a chance to \"begin again\" and try to improve upon what has happened in a past life, even attempt to atone for mistakes they've made, especially with loved ones.  This is a central and driving need for all of us--the desire to be loved and to achieve a state of reconciliation or atonement.  As such, the reader can relate to the desires felt by the modern characters of Jo, Sam, Nick and Tim.  Despite all the hardships they endured and\/or perpetrated, in their souls they sought love and resolution.\n\nBecause of my religious faith and some of the graphic and adult nature of some of this novel, I can't say that I would heartily recommend it to those who share my beliefs.  However, if you can look past the spiritual overtones and see it as a time-traveling adventure and a realistic depiction of how people lived & were treated 800 years ago, then you should enjoy Lady of Hay.  Not all of it wraps up with a perfectly tied bow at the end, but the main conclusion is satisfying and the tale as a whole was an interesting experience.  If nothing else, it made me grateful for the beliefs I hold to be true (and not fiction) and for the husband I heartily enjoy in this singular life.\n\n***********\n\n(I wish I could give this title 3 1\/2 stars, as I enjoyed it, but not enough to warrant 4 stars.)","summary":"The Return of \"Lady of Hay\"","unixReviewTime":1287360000,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

In 1970 Jo herself was hypnotized, but remembers very little about the incident. What she doesn't know is that she nearly died during the session, her heart having stopped, and the hypnotherapist gave her a mental suggestion so that she would not remember anything that occurred.\n\nNow, 15 years later, Jo has agreed to be hypnotized again for her research. Her old flame Nick is adamantly trying to talk her out of it, while his brother Sam is as well. However after the first session, Jo regresses to 800 years in the past and finds herself seeing her life through the eyes of Matilda de Braose, The Lady of Hay.\n\nBefore she knows it, Jo's hypnotic trances are getting really vivid and she is having a hard time distinguishing what's real from what happened to Matilda. She learns that Matilda was unhappily married to William, but was secretly in love with Richard de Clare. She experiences Matilda's pain and heartache. Jo even finds herself missing Richard and wanting to regress just to be able to be with him, if only in a trance.\n\nWhile under hypnosis, Jo experiences Matilda giving birth to her first born son. When Jo awakens she find herself having post-partum symptoms. She also misses the baby and hears him crying at night.\nJo starts to think that she may have at one point in time actually been the Lady of Hay, and is just now remembering her past life. She also insists on being hypnotized again and again until she finds out what became of Matilda. But soon enough, scared of what is happening to her, she tries to make herself forget Matilda, to no avail.\n\nAt 571 pages, Lady of Hay is a pretty hefty book. It took me about 100+ pages in to get hooked on the story. All the while, I didn't really relate to any of the characters, but I was curious about what was going to happen next. The plot fascinated me, but some of the characters annoyed me, mostly the men in Jo's life. There's some physical violence during the current day storyline, and the female characters put up with it, which had me shaking my head as I read.\n\nI found the scenes where Jo would regress into Matilda's life to be really interesting. That's when the book really took a turn into the historical fiction element of the story. Barbara Erskine makes a smooth transition from Jo's world to Matilda's and vice versa. You can also tell that the author did alot of research for the book. The events and people in Matilda's world are well detailed.\n\nThe plot is full of drama, backstabbing, time travel and a touch of romance. I liked the paranormal element to the book as well. There's alot going on in this story and I found myself hooked from the second half of the book until the end.","summary":"Lady of Hay","unixReviewTime":1286841600,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

The emotions of the characters reel you in as if you were a prize catch on the line but believe me when I say that there is no struggling to put this down.  I found this real and engrossing as if you are watching a 3D movie in the best of theaters.\n\nOur heroine Jo volunteers for an experiment on hypnotism.  Right from the start our secondary characters are in awe and pretty much scared half out of their wits with the intensity of Jo's regression. The results bring forth many physical manifestations that could bring about a costly price to Jo herself so her memory is wiped clean for her own safety.\n\nUpon seeking out a professional so that she can verify clinical results for an article she is working on, Jo gets caught up in the experiment these many years later.  Can she help herself to deal with what is about to start happening to her?  Will she be strong enough to change a past life for the good of a woman she never even heard of?  Will Jo's physical manifestations catapult around her sucking in people she knows as well as strangers to the point that not only is the past coming to life but the present is changing also.\n\nThis story has a double intensity as far as I'm concerned for I do believe in past lives belonging to one person.  One soul, multiple renditions of lives lived, loved and died only to become again.  Those feelings of, \"gee have I been here before because it sure feels like it\", as well as others just might have some credence to them.

What an extraordinary novel!\n\nLady of Hay is the story of Jo Clifford, a head-strong journalist who falls prey to being an easy subject for past-life regression within hypnosis, or even reincarnation. When Jo is under hypnosis, she lives the life of Matilda de Braose; a woman head-strong in her OWN time during the late 12th and early 13th centuries. Not only does Jo bring components of Matilda back to present time (scars and bruises for example), but we also begin to learn that her present-day lover Nick and his brother Sam are also present-day men that knew Matilda. WHAT?! you may ask?\n\nLady of Hay is abundantly full of intrigue, suspense, and violence, and is good enough to keep your interest despite its length of over 700 pages. Lady of Hay will pull you in; and its combination of past and present events are distributed evenly and tastefully throughout the book. We become frustrated that Jo is forever drawn to Nick, whose past-life character continues to hurt her, and we also become emotional when dealing with Matilda's life woes and hardships. The only aspect of the book I disagree with is Jo's weakness in regards to Nick. I figured a strong, intelligent woman would not keep succumbing to Nick's advances. The redundancy of Jo constantly returning to Nick becomes annoying as we reach the end.\n\nAlthough the novel was written in 1986, Lady of Hay is still very much a classic. The dialogue between the present-day characters is a little time-sensitive and old-fashioned, but it does not deter from the storyline and the joyful experience of the book.\n\nLady of Hay is Barbara Erskine's debut novel, and I am disappointed that I did not learn about the author sooner. Barbara Erskine is now very prolific in historical fiction featuring Wales, and her latest title is called Time's Legacy.

This is totally understandable to me, as I just finished the book and spent a while sorting my feelings about it out.\n\n That said, I really like this book. I'll tell you why in a moment.\n\n  Jo Clifford is nineteen years old and volunteers to be a patient in a hypnosis experiment taking place at her college. While under hypnosis Jo becomes extremely agitated and then, her hands begin to bleed. The professor conducting the experiment is thrilled, he thinks Joanna is showing signs of stigmata, but his assistant Sam Franklyn, is scared. Then, Jo's hearts stops and she nearly dies. Sam manages to bring her back to life. This is the prolog.\n\n  Fast forward fifteen years. Jo has recently broken up with Nick, who is Sam's younger brother. She is a freelance journalist and is starting to write a series on nostalgia, one of the articles is about past lives and reincarnation. At this point she has no idea what happened to her all those years in the college experiment because the doctor conducting it gave her a post hypnotic suggestion so she wouldn't remember.\n\n Nick does know, and try's to dissuade her from writing the article, but she is too mad at him for cheating on her to care. So she begins to write the article, and is hypnotized by a doctor she goes to interview.\n\n Immediately Jo is flung back into the past. She is Matilda de Braose, women who is married to a twelve century marcher lord in Wales, but is love with the handsome Richard de Clare. And King (currently Prince) John of Robin Hood fame is in love with her.\n\n  As Jo continues her trips to the past via regression it becomes obvious that the three men in Matilda's life, her husband William, her lover Richard and her lord John are all involved in Jo's life as well. The men, Sam, Nick and Tim (a photographer Jo frequently works with) begin to act strangely.\n\n This book was very exciting. The story line is going at a break neck speed until about page four hundred, when it slows down it bit. It does seem like some of it could be cut, but I couldn't tell you what parts.\n\n My only gripes with this book are few. The scenes in the past can be a little boring, the evil man in Jo's life seemed to becomes very evil very fast, and I don't think you can really hypnotize someone over the phone. Also I was a little confused about the scenes where Jo thought she was Matilda talking to her husband but really she was being hypnotized, and something like the conversation she was having never really took place in Matilda's life. (You'll understand that if you read the book.)\n\nSpolier alert!!\n\n  Also given everything that happened in the book the ending was a little un realistic. I mean, after having a man rape you in not one but two incarnations it seems like you'd have trouble trusting him again, much less loving him.

This catastrophe fails at both. I have read many many entries in this genre from the extraordinary to the putrid.  Lady of Hay falls somewhere below this last category.  As other readers have commented, this book is about 200 pages too long. The author has managed to confuse tedium with suspense by dragging out the conclusion long past the point of reader exhaustion.  Ms. Erskine's attempts to interweave the present day \"plot\" with historical narrative is a complete failure, as she only manages to disrupt both story lines resulting in a herky-jerky narrative flow that became quite annoying.  Compounding the problem, not a single character is the slightest bit sympathetic, and although I began the read with curiosity and interest, I ended feeling frustrated and cheated.  There are many red herrings dropped along the way that kept me reading, but I got no satisfaction at the end.  Why do we meet everyone's mother?  How many literary agents, photographers and editors need to be introduced by their names, only to drop from sight 20 pages later?  What about nurse Jeanne's foreshadowing of Matilda's illegitimate daughter ultimately giving her secret away resulting in calamity?  Did I miss that scene as I waded through episode after repetitive episode of modern Jo swooning in the rain as she \"channels\" Lady Matilda?  There are too many superfluous characters, seemingly all of whom are interested in and experienced with past life regression, who I kept expecting would have some role in the overall \"meaning\" of this morass, but they never did.  Not to mention, most of the players seem good candidates for Alcoholics Anonymous.  I cannot recall another novel which features wine, ale, scotch, Pimms and their ilk as the central focus in seemingly every scene.  The insane behavior of all principals appeared to be nothing more than the result of years of alcohol poisoning - a Medieval Lost Weekend.  I became so exasperated with their antics and cruel misdeeds that I actually found myself rooting for them all to be sent to the pokey or a rehab facility.\n\nThis book was a major disappointment in every way.  It is short on history and long on artifice.  If there were some way to award negative stars, this is the ideal candidate.

Jo is a young journalist who researches past life regression for a magazine article. As research, she undergoes hypnosis and discovers that she is not only easily hypnotized (so easily that later in the book someone calls and hypnotizes her over the phone!) but in a previous life she was Matilda de Braose, a 12th century Welshwoman. How exciting, I said to myself. This could be very fun. Matilda is a real historical figure. I love historical fiction. I would enjoy the puzzle of matching past lives with present characters, and of course I hoped for romance. But alas...it was not to be.\nThe first half of the book was great.  It keeps up a good pace and intriguing events unfold as Jo and her present life alternate with regressions to Matilda's existence.  But by the second half of the book there is no new material and far too much repetition as well inexplicable violence against the main character that simply turned me off to her possible love interests. In the 1st half of the book we learn that 3 men love Jo in both the past and the present and we know who they were in their past lives.  We also learn about the end of Matilda's life very early in the story.  So where can the author take us from here?\nI hoped that some of the modern day characters besides the 3 men would eventually be revealed to have some involvement in the past lives or a more important role in the present.  However, they don't.  I also expected that that the author might expand on history and offer an explanation for the legend of Matilda building Hay castle in one night.  She doesn't.  And I was disappointed with the mundane theory about rumors that Matilda was a witch.  The explanation: she studied herb lore with her nurse Jeanne and rides horses swiftly, like a man. But perhaps most disappointing of all is the fact that Nick, the man she is in love with in the present was very cruel to her in her past life and not very nice to her in the present and there is no satisfactory explanation of why.  Nor did it seem that his behavior was ever an obstacle to their relationship in the present.  And what about Sam's behavior?  The actions of 2 of Jo's lovers leaves me questioning how much if at all, they really care(d) for her.  Richard was the one nice guy and I was hoping he would somehow turn out to be a hero, but when he turns out to be a junkie I think my hopes for a satisfying finale were extinguished.\nMaybe the fact that 3 men are supposedly in love with the main character is the romantic attraction of this book.  Or is it Jo's suffering that is intended to be attractive?  Perhaps I was ultimately disappointed because of the promising start, but my advice is to skip this book.","summary":"Promising start...but ultimately disappointing","unixReviewTime":1066780800,"vote":13.0,"image":null}

Lewis","reviewText":"I bought and read this book when I was 13 and visited London.  At 13 I adored it passionately.  At much older than 13, I find it a bit laughable.\nFirst, I agree with several reviewers who object to the \"strong, independent\" heroine being raped and abused, and finding her \"happily ever after\" with one (!!!) of her rapists.  His excuse was that he was hypnotically regressed to King John at the time.  Oh, well, of course.\nThe historical parts of the book are outstanding, detailed and well-researched, and they win 100% of the three stars that I give this book.  Readers of Sharon Kay Penman's _Here Be Dragons_ will find this an excellent companion piece.  In fact, if you love medieval Welsh history, I highly recommend getting this book and just flipping the pages whenever the modern characters appear.\nThe original cover art I have from my British edition reads, \"Fascinating, absorbing, and original.\" The first two are subjective, but as many reviewers have pointed out, it is hardly original; Anya Seton's _Green Darkness_ and Mary Luke's _Nonesuch Lure_ played the same themes at least 20 years before _Lady of Hay_ was published.  But it became even less original when Barbara Erksine began searching out abused women in British history and did the same thing over and over again, injecting historically inaccurate feminism along the way.  _Lady of Hay_ is definitely the best of her efforts in the past-life regression genre.","summary":"Wonderful history, it's the modern people I want gone...","unixReviewTime":1052352000,"vote":8.0,"image":null}

This writer is acclaimed for her scholarliness so I was terribly disappointed.  This book offends me.  She sets feminism back by decades with her repeated and offensive rape fantasies. One scene was tolerable since it sends the idea that in those days women were mere chattel.  But, please, I threw it out after the second one. I picked it back up to give the author another chance and finally just grew too disgusted by rape scene number 3 to continue.  I would not want my daughter to read it - nor my son!  The women characters (past & present)  were disloyal, dishonest and manipulative. The men deceitful, weak or brutal.  One may hope that Erskine does not depend as heavily on alcohol as her heroine does.  About a third of the way through the book, it became laughable. If you seek a good reincarnation novel, try Amy Tan's superlative, wonderful Hundred Secret Senses, the more serious Search for the Girl With the Blue Eyes by Jess Sterne or even the romantic fiction Somewhere In Time. Anya Seton's Green Darkness is another and I do believe Erskine relied heavily upon its plot scheme and characters (if she did not simply plagiarize.....).  My message to the readers - Don't bother!  My message to Barbara Erskine: Get a therapist or switch to red-cover, \"heaving bosom\" press so that I won't be fooled again. You should find rape repulsive, not titilating or romantic.

Sullivan","reviewText":"Coincidentally, I had just finished reading 'Here Be Dragons' by Sharon Kay Penman that covered a somewhat later period of Welsh history but featured many of the same historical figures as this book.  'Here Be Dragons' is ten times the book this is.  If I have one pet peeve it would have to be authors who command their characters to do illogical things.  Case in point: At the beginning of this novel, the title character Jo, has just broken off a relationship with the man in her life who has gone off to pursue another woman yet, there is no discussion of what preciptated the breakup and the heroine nonchalantly allows the 'rat' to waltz blithely in and out of her life and apartment without batting an eyelash.  The 'rat' and his brother also have a relationship about as fraternal as Kane and Abel but there is no discussion whatsoever as to why.  I also found it rather ridiculous that all the men in Jo's modern existence had ALL followed her from her previous incarnation 800 years ago!  The heroine also runs around Wales falling spontaneously into regressive hypnotic trances at the drop of a 'Milady'.  The author even had one of her 800 year old, medieval characters utter \"Hey\" like he was hailing a cab.  C'mon!  Maybe this book should be better classified as science fiction?  I am as willing as the next person to suspend disbelief for the sake of a good yarn but because of the author's inablity to flesh out the details to make her protagonists credible I found the characters of this novel did not develop beyond cardboard cutouts.

My father used to talk about them; they ran some of the shops and inns, they traded with his parents, he went to school with them (they gave him their chicken sandwiches and he gave them his pork kielbasa ones). One of these Jews, a trader called Samuel, often came round to the farm and would chat with my grandparents. He would make complimentary comments about my grandmother's Bigos, hinting at being given a bowl. She would joke with him and warn him that the Rabbi would have something to say if he knew he was eating pork... and he would joke back. When the Germans came Samuel came to see my grandfather and asked him to help him. My grandfather said, \"I can hide you for three days but no longer, if the Germans find out then they'll not only kill me but my wife and children as well.\" Samuel replied that he would not impose himself on his good friends but would find another way of surviving.\nHe didn't. He and all the Jews of Gdow; shopkeepers, innkeepers, tradesmen, schoolfriends, ended up in  Belzec and were turned into ashes, bones and dust.\nThis book is about something that is almost taken for granted throughout. It is not really about the courage it took to survive in the sewers of Lvov because survival is not about courage, more about determination to live despite all the hazards. This book is about the courage of one man, Leopold Socha. To put your life in danger for others is a brave choice, but to put the lives of those you love at risk... that takes a kind of courage few people actually exhibit - yet so many in Poland did in that nightmare time. Socha may not have started with saintly aspirations but there can be no doubt that saint he became.\nI was inspired to read \"In the Sewers of Lvov\" after watching Agnieszka Holland's \"In Darkness\" (it's the original book that the film is based on - \"The Girl in the Green Sweater\" is a more recent 'compilation' of reminiscences written partly by the small girl who survived). It's a very easy read and gives us a reasonable picture of what life was like for the individuals who hid in the sewers as well as in the ghetto and the concentration camp, Janowska, nearby. It's not intellectually demanding since, I believe, it was written for the general audience. I was quite surprised at how much the film reflects the book yet, whilst there is little new in the book (having seen the film), I still enjoyed it and still found it fascinating.\nIt's surprising how little of the dirt and smell, even danger, comes across. The small group of Jews helped by Socha had obviously grown so used to the horrible circumstances in which they found themselves. It's only really towards the end, when outsiders become involved, that that one becomes aware of the dirt and smell and conditions they had to endure. Most of the story, based on the written reminiscences of the leader of the group, Ignacy Chiger, and interviews with other survivors, deals with their day-to-day survival, the relationships within the group, the arguments. Whilst there are deaths they are largely almost incidental... this story is about life... and the courage of that one special man who found safe havens and brought them food, Socha.\nThe moment that really stands out for me is that one when the dirty, hunched, almost blind group finally come to the surface. People stand around amazed, stunned. The little boy is frightened and wants to go back down. Socha stands there proudly. \"This is my work,\" he says, \"These are my Jews.\" How many of us can ever hope to have that courage and that pride?\nAnd the final chapter, the one dealing with the aftermath is new stuff to those who have seen the film, apart, that is, from that final tragedy and those disgraceful words...","summary":"Needs to be read...","unixReviewTime":1358640000,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

It is not a boring read--anything but, for Braudel's depth of research, breadth of knowledge and his appreciation for the limits of current scholarship are matchless. Where authors like Friedman incautiously grind whatever axe they set out, drawing upon work which supports their thesis, Bruadel is ever-cautious about drawing hard-and-fast conclusions from the data he has culled from archives' dusty pages.\n\nWhat Braudel reveals is a world which has been disrupted by far-reaching trade for hundreds of years. Capital has flowed across the great oceans of our globe for far longer than most people realize, destroying local industries in favor of distant ones in the process. It is impossible to summarize such a rich, vast work, but reading even one of these volumes will give you a deep insight into the long history of globalization, and how entire industries and financial centers have been displaced time and again in the Arab Levant, in Asia, and in Europe. You will also come to understand the rise of European economic dominance, and how it cannot be so neatly attributed to guns, steel and germs, as appealing and powerful as Jared Diamond's thesis may be.\n\nBraudel does not work to create over-arching explantions so much as present the archival facts he so assiduously assembled. (The books were written in the late 1970s; Braudel died in 1985 at the age of 83.) For example, he shows that prosperity, since at least the 1400s if not earlier, is inevitably found in those cities and regions where prices are highest. It is counter-intuitive at first--since shouldn't money go farther where prices are low?-- but the same is obviously true of our era. The most prosperous nations are those with the highest costs, and the poorest are those where prices are lowest.\n\nAt a minimum, this sheds light on the centuries-old exodus from rural to metropolis, and on the nature of prosperity itself. I recommend these volumes not just for their vast erudition but for the enjoyment gained from his unparalleled mastery of everyday life in distant lands and distant times. Not much has changed, it seems, except the speed of the ships and the communication between traders.","summary":"Capitaliism, trade and globalization explained","unixReviewTime":1147737600,"vote":17.0,"image":null}

The second volume deals with the market economy, while the first volume, Structures of Everyday Life takes on infra-economy or material civilization. As I said on the review of the first volume, in the pre-industrialized societies, the market system is not the only form of resource allocation. The material civilization is the first layer of economy on the bottom, the market system is the second layer located above the first layer. The exchange or commerce was not natural economy but artificial economy in the jargon of the 18th C economics: Market is premised on the separation of production and consumption. Such a division is not natural, but is developed over long time. In this vein, the market is not natural at all. The market is the point in which material life and economic life meet each other. The market is the network. It links region to region, national economy to national economy. The form and scope of market has been evolved over time. When we track the forms of market, we could paint the history of capitalism. Nonetheless, Capitalism is often regarded as synonymous to market economy. But market is not unique to capitalism. But it goes without saying that capitalism cant exist without market. All economic activities under capitalism are carried out on the market. Changes in the form of market signals the changes of capitalism. When, for example,  we talk about globalization, we have in mind the change of market based on national economy to global market. The second volume is about the topology of market. Based on the scope of space the market serves, we could trace out the path of capitalism since the 15th C. But market is not capitalism. To understand this point, youd better check the third volume, The Perspective of the World.","summary":"Topology of the market","unixReviewTime":1026172800,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

Crawford","reviewText":"Historians, they say, are either lumpers or splitters:  the former seek to make generalizations while the latter seek to refute and refine them.  Braudel strikes a balance between these approaches, at one time examining the economic point of view (and related theoretical controversies, such as the ideas of Schumpeter on innovation), while searching for historical examples that support or obliterate them.  He is a true master scholar.\nThis volume adds to the first, moving from living standards to the establishment and functioning of trading and banking systems, both by capitalists (holders of sufficient resources to manipulate markets) and the merchants and craftsmen who operated within these markets.  It is a crucial distinction that demonstrates how simple-minded the ideological argument of \"free markets\" can be:  the rich can and do design economic systems to function to their advantage.  You follow the development of international trading networks by Italians, Jews and Armenians; the evolution of banking and the handling of paper money; and even the influence of social hierarchies on economic growth.\nWhile Braudel concentrates almost exclusively on Europe in this volume, which lessens the universality of his approach, it is utterly fascinating from page one.  The economic systems he analyses were somewhat incomplete, though evolving rapidly.  An additional limit to his approach is the exclusive focus on econimic life.  At times, he views the building of chateaux and the commission of great works of art from the Reanassance to the 19C as a reflection of the lack of wealth-generating investment opportunities during a time of economic revolution!\nAnd that is just a few of the issues covered.  Each section of the book is like an essay on some basic economic notion.  As such, the book assumes a great deal of historical knowledge in the reader, though Braudel often explains what he refers to briefly.  For me, this added to its appeal and density, but it is often hard going.  However, the book is leavened by wonderful and fascinating illustrations, which eases the task of getting through it at times.\nHighly recommended.","summary":"from lifestyle, to systems","unixReviewTime":991612800,"vote":46.0,"image":null}

Not as well known, and certainly not as widely read, was his equally important Das Capital that, painstaking, gives a historical analysis of the rise of capitalism based on the appropriation of surplus value by private owners. Where Marx worked in broad strokes to lay out his theory relying mainly on (and polemizing against) bourgeois economists the work under review, the second volume of a three volume study of the evolution of capitalism, Fernand Braudel's Wheels of Commerce, fills in the spaces left by Marx's work. Although Braundel, of necessity, tips his hat to Marx's insights his work does not depend on a Marxist historical materialist concept of history, at least consciously, although in its total effect it is certainly comparable with that interpretation of history.\n\nBraudel digs deep into the infrastructure of medieval society to trace the roots of capitalism to the increased widespread commerce that the rise of rudimentary production of surplus goods permitted. He highlights, rightly I think, the important role of fairs, other lesser adjunct forms of commercial endeavor like peddling and shop keeping, and the rise of fortunately located (near rivers, the ocean, along accessible roadways) cities committed full-time to creating a market for surplus goods being produced in the those cities, on the land and, most importantly, in far-off places. Naturally, such activity as the creation of markets kept creating demand for more and varied products making more expansive (and expensive) journeys necessary. The opening of wide-flung trade routes, over land and on the seas, exploited by merchant-adventurers (in the widest sense of that term) thereafter became practical, if still highly risky, for those committed to those activities.\n\nNeedless to say in a densely written six hundred page volume the number of examples of commercial endeavors (some presented in more than in one context) that Braudel highlights is beyond anything a short review could do justice to. A quick outline here will have to suffice. The already noted rise of a merchant class ready to do business over great stretches and under trying circumstances; the still controversial basis for the rise of a distinct capitalist ethic that drove the markets(think Max Weber and the Protestant ethic); the importance of double bookkeeping of accounts and the introduction of bills of exchange to facilitate payment; the exploitation of vast colonial areas for minerals and other natural resources such as gold and silver used as physical value in every day market exchanges; the rise and fall of Spanish and Portuguese colonialism based on the gold and silver mines and slave trade; the successive rises of the Dutch and English colonialisms based on that slave trade and control of the sea lanes; the rise of joint-stock companies and other forms of collective capitalist ventures; the introduction of a stock exchange to place value on those enterprises; the increased role of a national state in the emergence of capitalism as defender of private property, as purchaser of goods, and insurer of last resort against hard times; the shifts in class status away from feudal norms and rise in class consciousness in society; and, the applicability of the capitalism to non-European societies such as Japan, and non-Christian cultures such as Islam.\n\nJust to outline some of the topics as I have just done will give one a sense that this is an important work (and act as an impetus to read volume one and three) for those who want to get the feel of what the dawn of capitalism looked like. And for those who want to move beyond capitalism a very good companion to that not widely read Das Capital of Marx.","summary":"The Wheels Of Capitalism In Its Swaddling Clothes","unixReviewTime":1307059200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Sullivan","reviewText":"In the first volume of this series, Braudel sets the stage for life and commerce in the period under discussion. Volume two of Civilization and Capitalism really gets the ball rolling. Or as much as anything ever gets rolling in a Braudel book.\n\nThis is fascinating stuff. But it is not easy going. The language is straight forward, but Braudel wanders around his subject, giving us mountains of specifics and following various side currents to their ends. The basic point of the volume is to outline, first, the difference between the market and capitalism, and then to trace the creation of capitalism in the markets centers of Europe between the 15th and 18th centuries.\n\nUnlike many historian of this period, Braudel is more concerned with the world of finance than the world of production, which I find fascinating and innovative. If you care to know how the financiers of Amsterdam dealt with getting a ship in the ocean and bound for America or India, this is the place to look.\n\nWhile not being an economic determinist, economics is at the center Braudel's work. Unlike many other economic historians, Braudel does take the time to deal with how culture (there a section on fashion in the first volume!) religion and other factors play into the shaping of an economic and social system. This makes for a deeply convincing argument when he demolishes Weber's idea of the protestant work ethic, but is less informed or convincing (and sometimes borderline racist) when he is dealing with non-western cultures.\n\nI appreciate that Braudel didn't assume that by \"civilization and capitalism\" one can only mean Western Europe, but his sections on the rest of the world I found lacking. They did not have the erudition he exhibits when taking about Western Europe.\n\nI found the book fascinating, but I think Braudel could have done with some editing. This book is not going to lay out point by point the creation of capitalism for you. You'll need to discover the steps through the examples Braudel gives. It's riveting if you're an econ and history nerd, but complicated and meandering work, which could have used a co-author (or a better team of research assistants) to handle the non western areas he covers and a editor to tease out the string of the creation of capitalism that subtly floats through this work.","summary":"A Brilliant History of Capitalism","unixReviewTime":1202256000,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

I usually do not like history because I prefer to be more proactive and immersed in today's world. But the clarity on our society's current situation that this book gives by examining the roots of the movement to capitalism is incredible and was so worth my time that I had to take a week's vacation off work in order to make sure that I could focus to read this. The writing conveys only one thing - complete clarity into the world today. It is an incredible opus; I loved it.\n\nThere is no easy answer to the challenges we humans face in organizing and creating a shared activity to enable the greatest overall productivity and happiness. The evolution of humanity during the early Renaissance years provides the explanation for where and why we are organized in this way today. Understanding this time in this way (through the lens of the economics of that time period) gives a much greater appreciation for the world today that we have constructed. The most core problems of humanity - social mobility, equitable distribution of resources, stability, and collective cooperation, have never (and may never) become solvable. This book explains these dynamics so eloquently that I wish I had time to read it again and again - much like a great adventure novel that as a kid you just wished would never end and felt a real loss once it did and you had to re-emerge into the real world around you.\n\nBraudel is phenomenal in his depth of understanding about how society of the 15-18th centuries operated. I can't recommend it more highly.","summary":"One of the best books I will ever read","unixReviewTime":1175904000,"vote":13.0,"image":null}
{"overall":4,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"06 8, 2006","reviewerID":"A36S5U0QOWMOSX","asin":"000216132X","style":{"Format:":" Paperback"},"reviewerName":"Garbarino Family","reviewText":"In The Wheels of Commerce, Fernand Braudel deftly blended history and economics with the result that neither suffers.  His goal in this book, the second volume in his Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century, was \"to analyse the machinery of exchange as a whole, from primitive barter up to and including the most sophisticated capitalism\" (21).  In the process of examining this machinery of exchange, Braudel also proposed an ambitious thesis concerning the origins of capitalism.  The book itself is a monumental work, an impressive combination of statistical analyses and illustrations from primary sources.\n\nBraudel's first two chapters, \"The Instruments of Exchange\" and \"Markets and the Economy,\" investigated the role of circulation.  In chapter one, he concentrated on the mechanisms by which goods (and money) were traded.  Braudel explained that markets and shops were at the bottom of the world of commerce.  Markets took place once or twice a week, and shops were open everyday.  Fairs, the wholesale markets, were on the higher level.  Participants traded large amounts of goods and settled their accounts at the end.  Braudel pointed out the importance of fairs in the development of capitalism:  \"The fair itself created credit\" (91). If one merchant had a negative trade balance with another merchant, he would either offer a bill of exchange (a promise of payment on another exchange) or defer payment with interest until another fair.  Additionally, these bills of exchange could be sold to a third party if necessary, introducing speculation.  The trading mechanisms of the fair were eventually consolidated into the large exchanges of cities like Amsterdam and London, and eventually these exchanges grew into the stock markets.  Chapter two investigated the manner in which merchants engaged in trade.  Braudel stressed the importance of trading circuits and the use of paper (especially in the form of bills of exchange) for profitability.  One of the key ideas in this chapter is the role of distance on price.  Price was not set solely by supply and demand, but was also affected by the distance the product had to travel.  His insight into system was helpful.  \"Any capitalist market has a series of links in a chain, and somewhere near the middle there is a point higher and more remunerative than the rest\" (193).\n\nThe next two chapters, \"Capitalism Away from Home\" and \"Capitalism on Home Ground,\" dealt primarily with issues regarding production.  Chapter three dealt with what could be considered the lower world of production.  One of the key issues that Braudel explicated was the role of fixed and circulating capital.  The fixed capital that was invested in production was tied up in equipment and other items, while the circulating capital was more liquid and included wages.  Braudel also investigated the role of land in production and capitalism, noting: \"The great landowner was not a capitalist, but he was a tool and a collaborator in the service of capitalism\" (271).  He also focused on the peculiarities of production in these pre-industrial years.  In chapter four, Braudel investigated the higher world of production.  His explanation of the development of banking practices, which would fund production, was illuminating, as was his discussion on the development of companies from private family business to joint stock companies.\n\nThough the book focused on capitalism's development in Europe, Braudel integrated discussions on other geographical locales as well.  Braudel did not present Europe as arriving at its capitalist system in a vacuum.  He noted the role that other cultures had in aiding the formation of the European model, not just through trade, but also through Europe's adoption of foreign innovation.  However, Braudel surprisingly downplayed the importance of double-entry book-keeping to the emergence of capitalism.  He asserted that the practice did not spread quickly and was not universally adopted, giving notable examples (574).\n\nEven though successful merchants were found all over the world during this time period (especially in Islamic lands that provided them with a favorable status), full-blown capitalism developed first in Europe.  Braudel attempted to provide an explanation as to why this was the case.  His thesis regarding this matter is the raison d'tre of the book.  Braudel believed that three conditions were necessary for the emergence of capitalism.  The first was a \"vigorous and expanding market economy\" (600).  Braudel noted that many regions fulfilled this qualification.  The second necessity, which hindered many prime candidates, was a strong hierarchy was necessary.  This hierarchy encouraged the accumulation of wealth.  Landed positions were not hereditary in India, China, and Islamic lands making the nobility's position precarious and the accumulation of wealth difficult.  Braudel only mentioned two areas that fulfilled these first two necessities: Europe and Japan.  However, Japan closed herself off to world trade, the third necessity.  Braudel noted, \"Long-distance trading ... was the only doorway to a superior profit level\" (601).  Braudel's case is a compelling one that must be addressed by anyone investigating this topic.\n\nThe Wheels of Commerce is immense, but immensely readable.  Braudel portrayed for his reader a heady, exciting Europe, one in which the prime goal was to spend money faster than it could be made.  However, even during his descriptions of the dizzying pace at which money was circulated, Braudel did not lose sight of his objective.  His scope was large, but he remained precise in both style and purpose, obviating the befuddlement of the layperson (which I confess to being).  The book is a balanced work, exhibiting a variety of historical methods.  Braudel made extensive use of statistics and mathematical models (the book contains a plethora of charts and tables), but he also included numerous narratives regarding business practices of the time (demonstrating an astonishing knowledge of the primary sources).  Because of the attention with which he supported his claims, historians of all stripes can admire this book.\n\nFinally, the student of economic history should not overlook one of the finer aspects of The Wheels of Commerce.  This book contains over 120 excellent illustrations from the 15th-18th centuries.  The pictures, which vary from woodblock prints to oil paintings, depict the lives of those involved in commerce at the time.  Not only do the abundant illustrations make this book a more attractive read, but also they provide the book with a certain level of completeness, giving the reader more tools by which he or she can comprehend the emergence of capitalism in Europe","summary":"Very Annalesesque","unixReviewTime":1149724800,"vote":29.0,"image":null}

She lives a reasonably comfortable life thanks to the inheritance of her father's house and a job as a local schoolteacher. Through her diary entries and exchanges of letters, mainly with her more glamorous younger sister Nora, Clara reveals herself to the reader. Wright has created a believable character that \"grows on you\" as her personality emerges little by little. Life's difficulties during the Depression years, in particular for a single woman in rural Southern Ontario become apparent through the description of daily events. However, a very dramatic personal incident and its aftermath force Clara to confront her new circumstances in a very direct manner.  While she was accustomed  to express her daily experiences and reflections in poems, events interfere and poetry becomes impossible. She recognizes \"how suddenly a life can become misshapen, divided brutally into before and after a dire event.\"  Her beliefs are challenged and so is her self-contained whole-ness as a person.\nClara's personal story is embedded in the realities of the mid-thirties where unemployment is rife and poverty spreading.  Although at the periphery of the main thrust of the book, Wright alludes to the emerging pre-war anxieties. He touches on the contrasts between city and rural living, utilizing Clara's reluctance to accept such innovations as the telephone, as an example. Yet, the regular Saturday trips to Toronto, perceived by her as a necessary escape from the village, lead to a new, important phase in her personal development, giving her also a new taste of independence.  She visits her sister in New York, although in rather difficult time in her life. Cleverly, Wright lets her visit pre-war Italy as a third party to her sister's vacation.  It allows the author to add impressions of the growing political conflicts in Europe as a backdrop without losing the focus of the story.\nThe counterweight to Clara is Nora, who could not bear small-town Ontario and leaves for New York to \"make it in radio\".  She becomes successful as a radio voice in daytime \"soaps\" and her personal life seems to take on some aspects of a soap opera itself.  Nora is privileged in finding a solid rock in a glamorous female friend, Evelyn, while her on and off affairs are far less successful. Clara, always concerned about her sister and her superficial lifestyle, attempts to remain the firm family base for her sister, but her own life story places her more and more on a shaky ground. She finds advice and empathy through her correspondence with Evelyn.\nClara Callan is a very engaging story indeed. Wright successfully places himself into the mind of a woman: Clara's personality quietly and gently takes hold of the reader as one follows her in the exploration of the multifaceted realities of her time and place.","summary":"An unremarkable life?","unixReviewTime":1038355200,"vote":25.0,"image":null}

The book is centered around four years - 1934 to 1938.  It is a book that is relayed through letters and journal entries which makes it a very intimate book.  The story is mostly about two sisters who were born in a small Ontario town.  One sister remains in Canada and the other pursues a career in radio in New York City.  In those days the radio was a very important entertainment medium, and many stories and serials were broadcast.  In some ways it was a magical time.  Radio is so much more intimate than television. This book is so well-written that these characters come to life in the pages.  The book is very engrossing as we follow the lives of Clara and Nora Callan.  It totally captivated me and I came to identify with Clara who was the girl that remained at home in the house that she was born in.  Somehow it seems that things just seemed to happen to poor Clara through no effort of her own.  I didn't want to put the book down and was sorry when it was over. Life seemed to be deceptively simpler then it is now for sure.","summary":"Well-worthy of its many literary prizes","unixReviewTime":1305417600,"vote":null,"image":null}

Payne","reviewText":"I found this book a little hard to get into and boring at the beginning, but it picked up halfway through and ended up being a fairly good book.  The book is  basically a combination of diary entries and letters between the book's main character, Clara, and her sister and a few other people who come into her life at various points. Through these letters, you follow the life of a woman who lives in a small, rural town in Ontario in the 1930s.  She is an unmarried school teacher in her 30s who has little chance of marrying and isn't even really sure she wants to be a wife and mother.  She is a poet at heart but is very private and only has one real childhood friend.  There is a side to Clara that no one really sees but comes out in her diary entries and occasionally in her letters.  Clara leads a rather uneventful and unremarkable life, but as the book unfolds, she travels, takes on a lover, and you begin to glimpse that there is more to this woman than meets the eye.  You often wonder why the story of this woman could possibly be of any importance until you realize near the end why the story matters - and who it matters to.\n\nThis is not a feel good, happy ending book.  It is a look at the harsh realities of life for a woman in a small town - a small town where everyone knows everything you do and your reputation is, if not everything, almost everything.  These people can be nosy and downright cruel in some cases, but also warm and supportive and giving.  If you can stick through the first third of the book, it is worth the read.","summary":"A slow start, but worth the read.","unixReviewTime":1291939200,"vote":null,"image":null}

The older sister of the first half of the book has so much potential which is fully destroyed by the author in the second half.","summary":"Disappointing, appearing to go somewhere, but never arrives","unixReviewTime":1235520000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Wright has managed to capture the emotions and morals of the late 1930's and early 1940's in this epistolary morality tale of two sisters, Clara and Nora, one a teacher residing in small, clannish Canadian town and the other a \"soap opera\" actress pursuing a career in New York City.\n\nWright's look at the plight of females of this era, attempting to maneuver through the social expectations of society while pursuing their own goals, is startling in its insight and accuracy and almost makes one feel as if this novel were written by a woman. (High praise indeed).\n\nWhen all is said and done, Clara Callan shows us freedom to pursue ones dreams comes with a price, and that perhaps things were not really so good in the \"good old days\".","summary":"SISTERHOOD, ROMANCE AND FRIENDSHIP IN THE \"GOOD OLD DAYS\"","unixReviewTime":1201824000,"vote":29.0,"image":null}

I had read The Weekend Man and Final Things by the same author, and both of those were excellent, but this book showcased Wright's incredible talent at his craft.\n\nThis book is written in diary and letter format from the perspective of Clara Callan, a thirtysomething school teacher in the 1930s.  It begins with her father's death, and her sister's move to New York City.  Clara is alone in the small town that she grew up, and she chronicles a 4-year period in great detail.\n\nI'm sometimes hesitant to read books by men with female protagonists because sometimes the unintentional maleness of the character's thoughts permeates their characterization.  Wright does a great job writing from a female point of view, however and Clara and Nora are easy to relate to and seem like they could be the same women that live next door or that you interact with day to day.\n\nThe research behind the book is very noteable, as the history of the times is effortlessly entertwined with the diary entries and serves as both editorial comment and historical re-telling.\n\nThis is a wonderful book and an incredible accomplishment.  It is definitely the type of book you should buy and then pass around to your friends to enjoy as well.","summary":"Highly Recommended","unixReviewTime":1139270400,"vote":12.0,"image":null}

Wright has written a marvelous story of two sisters who grew up in a small Canadian town. The time is the 1930's, and the author is able to bring alive the times, the movies, the newspapers, the famous people, the politics, and has been able to weave these events into the lives of the characters in the book.  The author received the Canadian Giller Prize and the Governor General's Award for this novel.\nThe story is told through the two voices of Clara and Nora Callan mostly in letter format. Letter format has not been a favorite of mine, but the author brings these women to life in a extraordinary manner.\nClara is a school teacher and lives alone in her deceased father's home. Clara was her father's favorite, and seems to be a lot like him, frugal and conservative. She is prone to think of excuses why she should not have a telephone or a radio. Clara is a lover of books and reads voraciously. And, Clara writes poetry, not the kind of poetry her family or friends would appreciate. However, she expresses her poetry to us, the readers in a compelling narrative.  She leads a fairly ordinary existence, but then something happens that requires all of her strength and perserverance and this changes her entire life.\nNora had more of a dream for her life. She left the small Canadian town for the big, bright lights of New York City. Nora found a job in radio very quickly and began her glamorous life. She soon had a job on a soap opera that became very popular, and she played the part of a beloved character. Her Canadian town is very proud of her- the young girl who made good.\nShe has several men in her life, but not the right kind. Either they are married or not the marrying kind. Life in the city that is so exciting becomes more humdrum, but she maintains that allusion of mystery .\nEvelyn is a friend of Nora's. She is an author and pens the scipts for Nora's radio show. They become good friends even though Evelyn is a lover of women and  Nora a lover of men.  Evelyn is very well paid for her job and lives extravagantly- Nora is often the lucky recipient while meeting the rich and the famous. Both sisters come to love Evelyn for her kindness and generosity, and she becomes a prime mover throughout their lives.\nEach woman has her tale to tell and brings with her the people she meets. Even though the lives of these women are disclosed, their characters are brought to life without deep psychological probing. These are people who are so ordinary and extraordinary at the same time.  The twists and turns of life are fully revealed and so rewarding in this marvelous book. prisrob","summary":"Masterful Storyteller","unixReviewTime":1074470400,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

He does this in an intelligent, perceptive and humane way. He was close to his father , had many long intimate conversations with him, and truly cared for, honored and admired him.\n\nThe story begins in 1915 when the young Renoir who has been wounded in the leg is released from the Army and returns home. He has too received terrible news which has crushed his father. The mother of the family has died. Returning home he and his father develop a closer relationship than they have had before.\n\nYoung Renoir traces the history of the family back to the time of his great- grandparents. He tells of the early years of his father , when he worked as craftsman doing portraits on porcelain. He tells of his father's understanding of his art and of the special joy in which he worked and lived.\n\nHe describes his father's economical and non- romantic approach to Painting. And he also tells the story of how his father continued to paint also to the very last minutes of his life. And how the honors and wealth which came to Renoir in his last years did not effect his fundamental vision or way of working in life.\n\nWhat is apparent through this work is that a loving son truly seeks to understand and represent his father truly- and that one great artist has a capacity for understanding another great one.\n\nA wonderful book.","summary":"An intelligent, perceptive, humane memoir","unixReviewTime":1178668800,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

This is odd, in a way: Claude was an old man (and in pain) when Jean got to know him, and Jean was an old man when he finally brought his recollectios together. You might expect cranky, but nothing of the sort: it's a book full of sunny afterglow.  Every parent would hope to be rememnbered so well.\nThe book might take a bit of getting used to: Jean has his own pace and his own way of telling his story.  We did it in small doses and I'm not certain yet that I quite catch the rhythm.  None of the rough edges have been smoothed off which, come to think of it, is just as Claude would have wanted: Jean speaks with his own voice.  You have to listen well, but you know that the voice is nobody else's.\nI suppose it helps to know a bit about the Impressionists to enjoy it all, but I can't say I know all that much, and I didn't feel impaired.  Anyway, God bless Google: more than once, when Jean talked about a painting or a subject, I key-clicked my way to an image and completed (as it were) the picture.\nKudos also to NYRB (this time) for producing what it does not always produce: a finished physical specimen  The paper feels like quality; the binding is sturdy, and there is a small but satisfying selection of pictures, both colored and black-and-white.  There is even an index of sorts (I assume from the original translator) but it is patchy and incomplete.  That last is a shortcoming, but forgivable in light of the book's other virtues.  In the NYRB firmament, this is surely a star.","summary":"Therapy","unixReviewTime":1072483200,"vote":12.0,"image":null}

He was an adventurer, a family man, a man who held interesting views on just about every subject under the sun, and finally, in his later years, a martyr to life.  Although this book was written by Renoir's middle son, Jean, it is  as vibrant and alive as if Renoir, himself, had just written the words in  his own hand.  Through this book we learn how the Renoir family left its  roots in Limoges and moved to Paris.  We read of Renoir's early years as a  painter of porcelain and how and why he became an artist, more  specifically, an Impressionist.  We learn of Renoir's marriage to Aline  Charigot of Essoyes, the birth of his three sons and his move to the south  of France.  Some of the most interesting sections of the book deal with  Renoir's feelings about the effect of light on a painting and why he  needed to paint in a \"natural\" setting.  Also, most interesting  are the chapters on the birth of Impressionism and Renoir's relationships  with the other artists of the time, such as Monet, Manet, Sisley and  Cezanne, just to name a few.  Lovingly and charmingly written, this book  truly brings Renoir to life and makes him accessible to all.  Absolutely a  must for anyone with even a passing interest in art or artists!","summary":"A Vivid Portait","unixReviewTime":957312000,"vote":22.0,"image":null}

Born in 1841, Renoir was older than most of the other Impressionists with whom he grew friendly later. He also had the  chance to see Paris as it was before the Commune and the war of 1870. He  lived a good part of his life on the Butte in Montmartre and it is hard now  to recapture the atmosphere up there among the hordes of tourists. Yet  early on Sunday mornings with a light rain playing on the umbrellas of the  artist's stands in the Place du Tertre, you can wander freely among the  memories of the rue Lepic and elsewhere, and catch glimpses of Renoir (and  others) as you pass through the old streets. Reading this book first will  help.\nJean Renoir is a very famous artist in his own right, having made  numerous films and become one of the most acclaimed directors in French  cinema history. Here he has taken great pains to paint a fine portrait of  his renowned father, this time with a pen. He has succeeded admirably.","summary":"A good book on Renoir; a good book too, about Paris","unixReviewTime":957225600,"vote":53.0,"image":null}

{"overall":4,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"01 20, 2018","reviewerID":"A2DCS39GFBJV24","asin":"0001945424","style":{"Format:":" Kindle Edition"},"reviewerName":"Kenya Starflight","reviewText":"Despite being a voracious reader, there are some books considered \"children's classics\" that I have never read.  I decided to rectify this recently by picking up \"The Secret Garden.\"  I was somewhat familiar with the story, as I'd watched a film adaptation of the story at one point, but am fully aware that books and their movies can often be vastly different.  So though I could predict certain things about the story as I read, I still found it an enjoyable read... even if it isn't my favorite book, and certain elements felt strange in their inclusion, especially towards the end.\n\n\"The Secret Garden\" follows Mary, a spoiled and unlikable young girl and the daughter of a British officer living in India.  When her parents die of a terrible sickness, she's shuttled off to England to live with a reclusive uncle, and finds herself lost and alone in the gloomy manor.  But as she sets out to explore her new home and make sense of this strange new land, she discovers the titular secret garden -- a garden that has been locked up since her aunt died in a tragic accident ten years ago.  Enchanted by the garden, Mary sets out to tend it and bring it back to life, aided by a grouchy gardener, a soft-hearted animal-loving boy named Dickon... and Colin, a cousin who has been locked inside all his life and treated like an invalid.  The garden turns out to be just the thing both Mary and Colin need to revitalize themselves... and it just may finally bring healing to a family long broken by tragedy...\n\n\"The Secret Garden\" is an enchanting novel, told with an almost fairy-tale-like language that evokes the sights, sounds, and smells of the English moors and gardens and their inhabitants.  The writing style is lovely, and paints clear pictures in the mind.  The heavy Yorkshire accents of certain characters can be tricky at times, but I managed anyhow.  And while Dickon as a character feels a little too good to be true, almost straying into Mary-Sue territory, it's nice to see Mary and Colin develop as the book goes in, gaining confidence in themselves and shedding some of the selfishness and bad temper their sheltered lives have given them.\n\nThe biggest flaw, in my opinion, is that the book strays into a weird fantasy\/magical-realism realm toward the end, which I feel wasn't foreshadowed very well.  I love fantasy and don't mind magical realism, but it felt out of place here, especially with Colin going on about studying \"magic\" while at the same time declaring he wants to be a scientist.  It just felt odd to me, and while it might be a product of its time (this book IS over a century old), it did taint my enjoyment somewhat.\n\nStill, complaints aside, I can easily see why \"The Secret Garden\" enjoys a reputation as a children's classic.  It's not the best children's novel I've ever read, but I enjoyed it, and am glad I gave it a chance.  Perhaps I'll pick up the author's other classic, \"A Little Princess,\" sometime in the near future...","summary":"Not perfect, but still deserves its reputation as a children's classic","unixReviewTime":1516406400,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

Perhaps, like I did and still do, she loves to read. Perhaps you want to introduce her to a book you loved as a kid, or perhaps you just want to give a unique and meaningful gift. For these or any other reasons, may I recommend The Secret Garden? There are innumerable reasons it's an enduring classic, and I think it should be on every family's, teacher's, and librarian's shelf.\n\nYou're probably familiar with the story of Mary Lennox, a neglected, lonely, and horribly spoiled nineteenth century English girl sent to live in her uncle's mysterious mansion. You know about the garden she brings back to life, and the way she changes the quality of life for her equally spoiled and imperious cousin Colin. These and other plot points provide great discussion fodder, especially for older readers. Younger readers can delve more into the mechanics of the story itself, what makes it different from the \"easier\" books they might be used to, etc. I definitely suggest reading this as a family and afterward, finding a great film version to compare and contrast. My personal recommendation is the 1975 BBC version, as it is extremely faithful to the book, but the most recent 1993 version is fabulous also.

With it's constant interjection of Yorkshire accent, it can be difficult for a younger child to read this book, but it is labeled at a lexile for fifth grade. My only recommendation is to help them by reading the parts out loud until the child gets the gist.\n\nRegardless, this is a fantastic, romantic story written over a hundred years ago by an aspiring, independent woman named Frances Hodgson Burnett. The Secret Garden focuses around a ten year old girl named Mary who grows up in India spoiled and seemingly incapable of love. Her parents, from her birth, dumped her on her caretaker, just referred to as her Ayah, and promptly forgotten about. She was fed, cleaned, dressed, and \"cared\" for without much thought. As she grew from babyhood into a child, she was used to getting everything she wanted. She never tied her own shoes or made her own food and she simply was handed what she desired. To cross her was to be met with a fit of rage from Mary. When her parents, Ayah, and the rest of the well-to-do household die of a cholera epidemic, she is left behind, forgotten. Authorities find her, identify her family, and ship her off, back \"home\" to England. Mary doesn't even know that place would be considered her home country and she has no concept of the idea of home or love or affection.\n\nOnce in England she is brought to Misselthwaite Manor, the sprawling mansion of her uncle Archibald Craven. It is a barren place, set on an endless moor, with only servants and locked doors and locked gardens as company. The lap of luxury Mary is used to becomes a stagnant, drab location with little to incite imagination or caring. She is told, however, of certain things that spike her curiosity. Master Craven is rarely home. He also shut a garden up and locked it ten years ago on account of the fact that his wife, Mary's aunt, died within. The garden was her and Craven's favorite place, and unfortunately, to have died there was too much for Craven. Curious, bored, and without friends, Mary sets out in an attempt to find the buried key and to open the secret garden. With the help of a servant named Martha, Dickon, Martha's brother, a robin, and a boy that is discovered who turns out to be her cousin, Mary discovers the garden and all it has to offer.\n\nHer cousin, Colin, and herself are cut from the same cloth: spoiled and used to getting their own way. But once they enter and observe the garden renewing itself and coming alive after being dead for so long with just a little care and attention, they unknowingly heal their own souls, come alive, and receive care and attention while also giving it. They can call the place home and understand love through the mirror of the garden's own abilities.\n\nA great tale about how a little can go a long way and that nature will provide where human interaction oftentimes cannot. Child and adult alike should be able to enjoy this tale and feel good after its completion, and maybe even desire to plant a garden, even just a small one as a reminder to take care of the ones you love and grow constantly.","summary":"Discovering Oneself Through Nature","unixReviewTime":1508803200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Her guilt-ridden mother refuses to accept that she is deaf and resists adapting to reality; only Grania's loving grandmother saves her from a life of illiteracy and loneliness. Grania is taught to read with \"The Sunday Book,\" a precious gift from her grandmother that becomes a metaphor for life's struggles and complications as Grania emerges from childhood, attends school, and meets \"Chim,\" a hearing man who loves her stillness. Just married, Grania must return home to wait while Jim goes to war as a stretcher bearer.\nOnce again, WWI emerges as incredibly pointless and bloody, as men are thrown into the confusion of the European front. Jim experiences the war as a haze of brutal sound. He steels himself to the sight of mutilated men blown apart, but cannot stand the sight of their hands, which of course for him had become the instruments of his personal \"language of love\" with Grania. Meanwhile at home, a beloved friend from Grania's childhood who became her sister's husband returns home, mute from a horror no one can imagine. Drawing on the foundation of love from her grandmother, the deaf Grania not only coaches him back to speech but heals her sister as well. The end of the novel feels tantalizingly like only the beginning for these wonderful multi-dimensional characters.\nItani is a wonderful writer, and manages to convey to those of us who hear what it's like not to be able to--she also shows what we the hearing might be missing! The background on the theories of language and teaching the deaf was fascinating, and Itani must have done some meticulous research. This is a wonderful novel well worth your time.","summary":"Language of Love","unixReviewTime":1081382400,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

At first, I was disappointed by this shift, but as the war (and ultimately, the novel) drags on, I wanted to know what was happening to Jim and the boys he was working with.\nItani writes wonderful, three-dimensional portraits of Grania's family, especially Mamo and Tress, Kenan, Fry, the various characters in Deserando, Jim (Grania pronounces his name as Chim), Irish (the name is ironic, considering that Grania is Irish) and even the teachers at Grania's deaf school.

Grania has been deaf since the age of five, and Itani opens her inner world to the reader, using Grania's voice to tell the story and gracefully conveying her deafness as part of her selfhood, not as a handicap.  Using short sentences of twelve to fifteen words when Grania is a young child trying to figure out her world, Itani begins the story in a simple subject-verb-object pattern, using no complicated clauses or involved syntax, which Grania herself would be incapable of using.  When Grania becomes fluent in sign language and lip-reading, the sentence structure becomes more complex.  By the time she marries Jim, a hearing man, sentences and syntax are fully developed, and Grania's ability to recognize ambiguity, to see relationships between events, and to respond fully to a hearing world are obvious in her \"voice.\"\n\nThe point of view alternates between Grania and Jim, once Jim goes off to war, and important themes--war and peace, life and death, love and friendship, and strength and dependence--weave and develop throughout their contrasting worlds, Grania at home and Jim at the front in Belgium.  Itani develops these age-old themes in new ways, sensitively incorporating them with the imagery of sounds and silence, sight and shadows, action and inaction, images we have come to associate with the life Grania and Jim share.  In Jim's traumatic world, sound becomes overwhelming:  pounding guns, explosions, screams of agony from wounded soldiers.  As a result of his life with Grania, however, he is also acutely sensitive to what he sees, discovering, ironically, that it is the hands of the dead and dying that communicate most vividly because they \"revealed the final argument: clenched in anger, relaxed in acquiescence, seized in a posture of surprise or forgiveness.\"\n\nThe subordinate characters further flesh out the themes.  The friendship and interdependence of Jim and Irish, his best friend parallel the love and support Grania has received from her sister, her remarkable grandmother, and her deaf friends.  Grania gains strength through them and is able to give support and strength to others when they need her, just as Jim gains strength from his relationship with Irish and continues to rescue the wounded and dying.  As the reader comes to know Grania and Jim and the love they feel for each other, Grania's silent but active world becomes more and more understandable to the reader.  Ultimately, the reader has to agree with Grania when she declares, ironically, \"Sound is always more important to the hearing.\"  Mary Whipple","summary":"Graceful and original treatment of man's oldest themes.","unixReviewTime":1064361600,"vote":9.0,"image":null}

It was a gift, and I didn't quite know what to expect, but it's turned into a real winner.\nSpanning the years from 1902 till the end of WWI, we follow the life of Grania, a child\/woman who became deaf following scarlet fever. From a loving middle-class family, she went to a boarding school for hundreds and hundreds of deaf children, grew into a self-sufficient young woman, became a nurse, and married a hearing man, Jim. He went off to war, as did her childhood friend and brother-in-law, Kenan. Improbably for that Great War, both men returned - but in very different conditions.\nDivided into several parts, the early chapters are Grania's education, learning to live as a deaf person in the world of the hearing. The next part is Jim's story of his war experience.\nThen comes Grania's ultimately successful efforts to return the power of speech to her mute and traumatized childhood friend. And finally the resolution of all the stories.\nThis book grows on you. One of the boldest risks author Itani took was to try (successfully) to convey Grania's silent world to readers, and to imitate the understanding of sign language as well as lip reading for those of us unfamiliar with the Deaf World.\nIt's a stunning and powerful book, showing the power of Story to convey love, union, and understanding - and ultimately, joy.","summary":"A tour-de-force.","unixReviewTime":1061942400,"vote":14.0,"image":null}

The comeuppance for the greedy people who abused this paragon is so satisfying that it obscures the great holes in the plot. A key character is introduced as an Indian servant who speaks no English, but somehow he manages to communicate quite nicely with his Eton-educated English employer and a young English secretary about a complicated scheme to help the distressed child, only to revert to very simple English later.  The diamond mine that catapults Sara from poverty to riches is, in her imagination, worked by dark men with heavy picks, but somehow her compassion and generosity doesn't extend to them, and her imagination doesn't raise the question why an English child should prosper from their back-breaking labor in a far-off country. She recognizes and rejects false friendship from English people, but when dark-skinned adults bow to her she is pleased and untroubled. Obviously, this book is a product of the Colonial Era and can't be expected to present an enlightened picture of the rights of the people of India, but it presents such a sunny view of the dark-skinned servants and laborers happily making young Sara wealthy and pampered that it would be nice to see her showing a little bit of empathy for them, rather than spending it all on the poor in London.","summary":"Careless and racist writing, but captivating","unixReviewTime":1508630400,"vote":null,"image":null}

I was drawn to reread it after seeing the musical Secret Garden on stage. The stage show is very different from the story, but both have their strengths. Mary Lennox is an unpleasant, sallow little girl who is orphaned in India when a cholera plague swept through their area. Her life in India had not been idyllic as she had been ignored by her parents and virtually friendless. She is sent to live with an uncle in Yorkshire England. She has never been to India and never met the uncle. Her uncle, Archibald Craven has not been coping since the death of his young wife 10 years before. Fortunately, Martha is there with her good nature and good sense. Martha and her brother Dickon work their magic. The first part of the book remains charming as the orphan Mary arrives in Yorkshire and begins to find her way and to investigate the mysterious crying in the night. Who wouldnt love Dickon with the orphaned lamb, young fox, tame squirrels, and ability to charm most animals? The second half of the book feels more dated in its repetitive preachy-ness about Magic. Still, every young reader needs to learn when to savor every word and when to skim along so this is not a bad opportunity to skim. The book is still something that a child could enjoy and the message of positive thinking and the benefits of being a polite kind person is still current. The Secret Garden is available for free from Amazon in a Kindle version. I can t give it less than 5 stars because of the special place that it holds in my childhood memories.","summary":"A Special Childhood Memory","unixReviewTime":1508544000,"vote":null,"image":null}

It's very quiet--too quiet.  As we try to inhabit the life and mind of Grania, deaf since the age of five from scarlet fever, we imagine what it would be like not to know when someone is approaching from behind, or to know when the speaker has changed in a conversation.  This book was just too slow-paced for me and the characters too one-dimensional.  Grania and her hearing husband Jim seem to be without fault.  More complex is Grania's sister Tress, who struggles with her emotions when her husband comes back from WWI disfigured and dysfunctional.  Another interesting character is their mother, who postpones sending Grania to a school for the deaf as long as possible, while she battles her guilt over Grania's hearing loss and seeks a cure via specialists and spiritual quests.  However, the author doesn't fully explore the inner conflicts of Tress or her mother, and we are left with a love story between two very nice people.  Jim's story is more disturbing than Grania's, actually, as he becomes a stretcher bearer during the war and sees both friends and patients blown up inches away from him on a regular basis.  His sections of the book are very moving reminders that the lives lost in wars are not just statistics.  The most moving and ironic incident is Jim's wordless interaction with a German counterpart as they both struggle to rescue their wounded on the battlefield.","summary":"deadening pace","unixReviewTime":1296000000,"vote":null,"image":null}

My enjoyment of these 99 pages is what makes this a three star book despite the fact I grew too bored to finish somewhere in the middle of part three.  Here is why:\n\nPart one is about a child named Grania growing up in Canada in the late 1800's.  A bout with scarlet fever at the age of 5 has rendered her permanently deaf.  Thankfully, Grania has an understanding family, especially her grandmother, and with their patience, she learns to lip read.  I know from my own experience, lip reading is not an easy task and this book shows us just how difficult it is.  Grania struggles to see words, understand words, and even feel words.  Readers will feel her frustration, her fears, and her shame at times.  When she begins school, we see how the deaf are treated by the hearing people with less than kind hearts.  The teacher does not want to take time out of her already busy day to ensure Grania understands what is going on.  The children like to laugh at her and play games that humilate her.  Most upsetting of all is the ignorant assumption that deaf means dumb.  When Grania is sent to a deaf school to learn lip reading and sign language, we see another world.  It is a world of silence, yet friendships build and minds expand.\n\nPart two is about an adult Grania who falls in love with a hearing man named Jim.  Jim is a nice fellow, but he does not hold my interest.  I found his conversations with Grania dull and their romance a bit sappy.  My mind began to wander.\n\nPart three follows Jim as he enters World War One and the fighting he experiences or sees.  This created a problem for me, as I said earlier, Jim just didn't hold my interest.\n\nPart one seemed a novel all of its own.  The style changed after that.  I realize the story is about Grania and Jim and World War One, but it just was not written the same as part one.  I encourage people searching for deaf fiction and literature to pick this one up tho.","summary":"Excellent First Part, A Bit Downhill From There","unixReviewTime":1251504000,"vote":null,"image":null}

And it was an intriguing one to contrast her silent world with the cacophony of the western front in World War I. The novel that results contains interesting characters and effective passages, but it is too diffuse to really work.\n\nGrania O'Neill -- the name is an anglicization of the Irish for \"love\" -- loses her hearing at the age of five as a result of scarlet fever. She wakens to a world shaped and contained by words, but where language is deceptive and words have to be agonizingly relearned. She has an ally in her grandmother Mamo; the relationship between the two is the most lovely thing in the book. But I found the early chapters repetitive and could never enter fully into Grania's world. I was more interested in the relatively brief section dealing with her time at a special boarding school and the battle between the two theories of education for the deaf: sign language and the oral method.\n\nAs a young adult, Grania falls in love and marries. But it is 1915, and her husband Jim goes off to war as a medical orderly. The unusual perspective makes some of the war writing quite powerful, occasionally approaching the intensity of classics such as Sebastian Faulks'&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/BIRDSONG\/dp\/0679776818\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">BIRDSONG<\/a>. And the scenes back in Canada show something even less often written about, a picture of wartime life on the home front. But the fact remains that there is an ocean between Grania and Jim, and their parallel stories barely connect. Still, a few touching episodes do manage to bridge the gap, as when one of their friends returns wounded and mute, and Grania teaches him once more to talk.\n\nThis is a book that needed to dwell in language and sound, and above all in silence.

Nicholson","reviewText":"A great novel!\n\nThis  book, by Francis Itani, revolves around the world of a girl\/woman who as acquired deafness through childhood illness. The setting is initially in Ontario, Canada in the late 1800's and then eventually alternating between Ontario and the European theater of World War I.\n\nI must admit I had some difficultly getting into this work, but I persevered and I'm glad I did, because this book is truly a magnificent read. Once committed, I could barely stand to put the book down.\n\nAs with all great books, what makes this book special, is the quality of the writing.  The prose just seemed to flow effortlessly off the pages as time melted away. You learn things about deafness, quietness and darkness that you never really noticed before;  you begin to appreciate what people without hearing have to endure to get through an hour, a day or a lifetime. There were a couple of occasions in this book where I was taken aback with a new revelation regarding deafness; where I would just let this book slip to my lap and think about what I'd just read.\n\nThere are parts in this book that are not for the faint of heart; some of the description of the trench warfare in France and Belgium are very graphic and disturbing. (but, most likely, accurate)\n\nAll in all, a story that is quietly beautiful and at the same time beautifully sad. Really, one of my favorite books. If I had to compare it to another book for quality, beauty and heartrending appeal, then I'd pick Charles Frazier's \" Cold Mountain\". Both books have that intangible timeless aura to them that separate them from their peers.\nHighly recommended!","summary":"\"Deafening\"...

Haines","reviewText":"The true test of an author is the ability to portray the mind of someone else.  Recently, that ability has been stretched by writers who describe the \"abnormal\".  The young, autistic Christopher in \"Curious Incident\" is the prime example.  Frances Itani takes us into a different world, that of the deaf.  It's a world of endless confusion.  There are sounds, so easy to the hearing, but meaningless to the deaf.  We think speech is the only important sound, but talk is hurried, undirected, and indistinct.  Nature produces her own sounds which we use in speech, but for which there's no meaning to the deaf.  Through Grania O'Brien's early life, Itani strives to introduce us to that world.  Does she succeed?\n\nGrania, who would have been \"Grainne\" in her ancestral Ireland, lives in small-town Ontario as the story opens.  Deafened by scarlet fever [remember that?], she's coached by Mamo, her grandmother.  Blessed with a quick eye for lip-reading, Grania is given a book with words displayed as rope.  The rope, of course, becomes highly symbolic as the book progresses, but Grania begins to equate the shapes with meaning.  Mamo strains to have the girl equate printed words with proper sounds.  It's important that Grania \"blend in\" with the rest of the community.  With her parents running a hotel, Grania's only other tie is with her sister Tress, with whom she develops a secret sign language.\n\nAll of Mamo's dedicated effort, nor trips to sacred shrines, can't force the pace.  Grania is to leave home for a \"Deaf School\".  Itani portrays the school as staffed with immensely caring ladies.  No Dickens intrudes with harsh discipline or abuse, but the school draws children from across the Province.  All the children remain in school until the summer holidays.  Sign language is discouraged for those who can speak - dividing the children, some of whom are mute.  Itani passes rapidly over Grania's progress in the school.  The deaf girl, however, manages to shed some of her fear of the dark - a long-held terror.\n\nMeeting a young aide in a hospital after leaving the school, Grania's life takes a new turn.  The courtship is but a moment in the story - the wedding description not even related until much later in the book.  Instead, the Kaiser rudely intrudes on their lives with the invasion of Belgium.  Itani carefully rejects any political discussion in the narrative.  King and Country [Britain, not Canada] are under threat and Jim must sign up.  There's no family discussion, no question of how Irish immigrants in a far land should react - Jim crosses the Atlantic.  There's a training stint, then Jim finds himself in the thick of battle.  When time and circumstances permit, letters are scribbled in muddy trenches.  Sometimes Grania's reach Jim, but delays in the exchanges make communication a flimsy thread.\n\nItani makes a splendid effort to depict the impact of the Great War.  Confronted as we are today by daily images of conflict, Itani still manages to impart a special sense of horror at events.  The years pass with Jim, a stretcher-bearer, braving the bombardments and fusillades of machine-gun fire, without being able to fight back.  He carries wounded, tends their injuries, dodges fire and grows increasingly introspective.  Never once, does he question the worth of the conflict.  At home in Desoronto, Grania watches the causality lists, the statistics of insanity, lengthen while she worries.  Soldier's wives need more visibility and Itani's effort is commendable.\n\nThis book cries out for a sequel.  Grania's life hardly ends with the Armistice.  With the end of the War, her deafness remains, the family is almost intact and a future must unroll.  Itani has built a unique scenario with skillful prose.  You will not find it easy to put this book down as you read.  However, when you do finish, you will find the conclusion abrupt.  Nothing is lost by that finale, but there might be much gained by going on.

It is often a dicey thing rereading something that you loved as a child. Often it does not stand up to the test or perhaps some previously unnoticed problematic elements.\n\nSomewhere I read something about A Little Princess that said that Sara doesn't use her imagination to the best of her ability because she didn't use it to figure a way out of her situation. I can't for the life of me remember where I read this but I have been thinking about it on and off ever since I came across it several years ago and I believe that it is unfair. Sara is eleven years old and living in Victorian London.  It isn't as if there is a safety net or as if there is a societal norm that recognizes childhood.  She is put to work immediately, but she is still far too young to make it out on the street on her own. If she was sixteen or older, she might have been realistically able to imagine a way out of her situation, but at age eleven and twelve all she can do is use her imagination to survive the best she can day to day.\n\nI tried to look past my infatuation with this book while reading it this time and notice the representation.  It wasn't as smooth as I would have liked. I still feel as if I have to be beaten over the head with it for me to see it without it being pointed out to me. It is a work in progress. Anyhow, India and an Indian character are part of the story. Becky refers to hearing that the man moving in next door is from India, and she thinks that he will be a heathen.  I think that that was supposed to be a comment on Becky's simple unworldliness as she wants it to be a whole family so she can learn how they live. The word \"Oriental\" is used, and the only Indian in the story is a servant. It certainly isn't a modern mindset.  I could see that it might be grating.\n\nI loved it all over again.  There is something about food and clothing being described in children's books. Toys as well. It is as if the imagery imprints itself upon your brain stem never to depart.  Sara's rose-colored dancing dress. Seriously, that dress.  The too short black velvet she wears after her father dies.  The last doll.  The meal in the attic with Ermengarde. It was all there just waiting to wake up again upon rereading.  I loved Sara with her quiet thoughtfulness; Ram Dass who sees so much; the Large Family, who doesn't get enough love; and Becky who just keep going no matter how much life tries to grind her down. This book still lives in my heart.","summary":"It is often a dicey thing rereading something that you loved as a child","unixReviewTime":1505433600,"vote":null,"image":null}

And since she's also the richest of them, it's hard not to see this characterization as a defense of classism and the inherent superiority of the wealthy. Sara becomes a little more compelling once she loses her family fortune and the narrative shifts into a Cinderella story, but she is still perpetually cast as a better person than those who are poor by birth (and who are regularly described in patronizing and animalistic terms by both Sara and the text). In the end she becomes rich again, her fellow maid gets the reward of being Sara's servant now, and there's not really any evidence that the child has learned or gained anything from the experience.","summary":"A classist bore","unixReviewTime":1503532800,"vote":null,"image":null}

Often when Ive gone back to re-read something from my past, I find that I don't think it as impressive or enjoyable, but that was not the case with this book. Yes, I see the characters, setting, and plot in an entirely different way, but I still thoroughly enjoyed the read.\n\nSince my book club wanted to focus on characterization, thats what Ill mention in this review.\n\nAt the beginning of the story I felt sorry for Mary. The author paints a perfect picture of neglect. Though Marys parents are wealthy and shes cared for, she is sickly looking because no one really shows her love and nurturing. When tragedy makes her an orphan, the saddest part wasn't the death of her parents, to me, it was that everyone else had forgotten about her. As much as I felt sorry for Mary, I also found her annoying, but I think all kids have that certain, signature youthful trait that lets them bother you to know end without you ever considering not caring for them. As an adult, I realized that as a child, I didn't recognize that Marys parents were a special breed of selfish that you can never have too little of.\n\nI liked how the moors seemed almost like another character in the story. Its quite mysterious to the plain and simple Mary whos never seen such greenery and fog. Then of course theres the garden with all its magic and wonder. Just like the animals that Dickon cares for, the garden is nursed back to life and then pays it forward (like a character) by being a haven and friend to the children. The transformation of the moor, the garden, and the children all parallel so well that its difficult to separate them as individual events.\n\nTheres no great mystery as to why the Dickon character is so loved. Hes an animal charmer and often the center of what the children call magic. Plus, hes just likable. As a kid, I think I too thought the magic was real. As an adult, I still wonder about the voices Craven hears that eventually bring him home to his son Colin. While He has neglected Colin in a similar fashion that Marys parents did with her, hes not completely absent from his life. He loves him, fearfully and from afar, and most importantly never forgets about him.\n\nIll admit that to this day Im still not overly fond of the Colin character, but I do appreciate his circumstances a little more. Its not his fault he is the way he is at the beginning, but I still feel like he enjoyed it too much. He somehow found power in holding his death over other peoples heads. I was almost relieved, when re-reading this story, to see Colin grow out of his young raja persona, but I still feel like he was a little prince at the end.\n\nI could go off about the actions and behaviors of the servants and adult characters in this book, but Ill simply mention that it reminds me of modern day Disney channel programming where all the kids are smarter and wittier than the adults. Not necessarily good or bad.\n\nAll in all, Id say The Secret Garden is good at developing characters as the story progresses. Being able to experience an intimate and personal evolution is a powerful technique that leaves characters in your mind long after youve finished their story. Highly recommended to fans of the classics, children, and anyone looking to read a good book.","summary":"Thoroughly enjoyed the read.","unixReviewTime":1501027200,"vote":null,"image":null}

So I decided to I take a second look at a previously enjoyed novel and give me crew me second reflections, as it were, upon visitin' it again . . .\n\nThis was an old favorite from back when I was a wee youngster.  I am not completely sure which edition I first read but I do remember that it had the illustrations by Tasha Tudor from the 1960s (as did the secret garden).  The copy I eventually purchased had her illustrations as well.\n\nI made the mistake of lending me copy many many long years back to a young lass so she could experience the magic.  And then never got it back!  I could only hope she couldn't part with it because she loved it so.  Then earlier this year at a Friends of the Library sale, I found an excellent pristine copy and swooped it up with glee.\n\nThen came the day to revisit this old companion.  Ye see I had not read this book since me copy was commandeered and I was looking forward to seeing if I loved it as much as me memory suggested.  The answer is an astoundingly yes!  Arrr!!\n\nI still adore this book.  The reading had the wonderful nostalgia of rediscovering details of the story as well as the perspective of seeing Sara's journey through me eyes of an older jaded salty dog.  I found Sara to be just as I remembered - compassionate, intelligent, and imaginative.  I still loved the secondary characters of Becky and Ermengarde.  I adored the lady who sold hot buns.  The riches to rags story still appeals heartily.  I loved Sara's treatment of everyone in spite of her circumstances.  She is polite, hardworking, and caring.\n\nThe part I found odd was the portrayal of the role of the adults in Sara's life.  So many people see Sara as a starving ragamuffin and yet don't help her.  Underclass poor children are depicted as savages as though it's their own faults that they have no money or education.  So many people outside of Ms. Minchin's school see and comment on poor Sara's state and yet she is not helped throughout most of the book except by a small compassionate child.  Now granted there would be no story if the adults helped her.  But it is odd that these children were left to rot.  Of course the author had her own riches to rags story growing up so I can only assume that it influences this work.\n\nBut despite the larger thoughts of child poverty, I still felt the magic of Sara's story and gobbled up this book.  I only hope that I don't wait so long for a re-read the next time.\n\nSide note: I have fond memories of the 1996 movie though I haven't seen it in forever.  And the Broadway musical sucks.","summary":"Second Reflections","unixReviewTime":1500681600,"vote":null,"image":null}

But as it has been quite a few years I decided to give it a second try, this time I was in love with it. The magic of the garden and childhood are created through the simple language and beautiful flowers. The story starts off with Mary, a spoiled brat, who after her parents die is sent to Yorkshire to live with her mysterious uncle. Mary never knew what it was to be a child until she came to her uncle's manor. Once at the manor she is able to rediscover herself and the beauty of nature. As someone going to college next year, I found it refreshing to watch the rebirth of childhood and find that it is not just limited to children.","summary":"Maci and Zoe's Review","unixReviewTime":1499731200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Burnett is really who got me started on this whole book obsession bandwagon, I still remember the day I checked out A Little Princess in my middle school library. Yep, those were the days of friendship bracelets and my new love for reading. These two aren't her only books but these are the most notable. I have just recently come across a beautiful edition in the Barnes and Nobles classic childrens edition (go check out my IG @bibliomanic_bookworm).  My thoughts on this book are a little mixed considering Im biased to her work, but this was an overall good read and would definitely recommend it. So, starting with originality, have I read something like this before? Of course not! This is a classic, the one that everyone else imitates. Although this was a completely original idea for a story, it was also super predictable. Already within the first chapter I knew what would happen because the writing made it ridiculously obvious. However, there was this one scene that I guessed wrong but I wasn't far off. I am more of a modern YA gal so reading this classic wasn't very relatable. I know this was written way before my time but I still had a little hope that I could understand at least some of what the characters were going through. I like reading about experiences similar to mine to see how others deal with certain situations (even if they are fictional) it helps me gain a bigger perspective on things and show me the world isn't all black and white. Now adding on to that this book didn't evoke any of my emotions. I didn't have any true empathy or sadness over their situation, I just had this passing pity for these children. With all of that said this tale was written beautifully and I give extra bonus points for the cover and the amazing illustrations included in my copy. This was a read for those of you that like a good heartwarming story about overcoming fears and finding the true meaning of family. Also, those of you who don't mind that some of the language isn't up to date.\n\n*SPOILER ALERT*\n\nFrom the very beginning when Burnett portrayed Mary as a spoiled brat I knew this would be a story of self-discovery and a turn in character for the little girl. I also figured out that the crying was Mr. Cravens child, the only thing I got wrong was the age. I thought it would be a baby that he had as a result of an affair that he felt guilty about,we all know how authors love a good scandal. I was a little disappointed to find out Colin was very similar to Mary in many ways. Although I guess it had done both of them some good to realize that they were reflections of each other, so that they could identify the wicked in themselves and change. I also think that the title is ironic because the garden was never really secret at all. From Ben Weatherstaff tending it every so often after the mother had died, and the children letting Dickons mother in on the secret (and all of his animals), the secret wasn't a secret at all. I will say that I absolutely adored the little robin, and how Burnett kept his side story going with his perspective from his nest. Now as for Mr. Craven I think that what he did to his son was unacceptable, leaving him to fend for himself and making him feel unloved and ostracized. I will give him the benefit of the doubt and admit that losing a loved one is extremely difficult, but that still doesnt give him any excuse to abandon his son like that. I doubt his wife would have wanted him to act like that toward the only piece of her that is left, and if he tried to have a relationship with his son then he might have had closure from her death telling him stories of her. She would have been able to live on through not only Mr. Craven but her son also. Although I think that was a bad move on his part I did like the scene when they reunited and he saw his son was healthy after all. These children just had some bad luck dealt to them, and they had to keep rolling with the punches, which I admire.","summary":"Loved it!","unixReviewTime":1499731200,"vote":2.0,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71cZFW9jazL._SY88.jpg"]}

Now in my second childhood, this was, therefore, my first encounter and I enjoyed the read even if there are failings from a writers perspective in the 21st century.\n\nHowever, as I started reading I found the descriptions and characterisations were pulling me into a secret world. The author had a way of using short phrases to capture a sense of the characters and settings. Maybe the technique would be hard to replicate today, but it worked in the context of the novel and the period in which it is set. This was a time before the First World War for both characters and author. This may explain a certain innocence that two world wars dispelled.\n\nLocked into the words and images, I was drawn deeper into Mary's world and her explorations. Robin was a cute character that felt almost human in his mannerisms. Some might say anthropomorphic - Anthropomorphism is the attribution of human traits, emotions, and intentions to non-human entities  but for me, the characteristics fitted the bird I knew from growing up in England. He becomes the character that unlocks the secret garden and the healing that Mary and others need.\n\nWhen she was in the garden, I could see it and sense it. Some might feel that Dickon is unreal and yet he came alive for me, first in what his sister Martha said about him and then when Mary met him. Ive been lucky that I have known a few special people like him and the character echoed memories of those that have a rapport with wild animals.\n\nWhen Mary found the source of the crying, the book added another character and another level. Damaged characters and healing is a theme from the start of the novel, but its the secret garden thats the catalyst. I liked all the interactions between the characters, and the use of mirror images that Mary and others must face to grow.\n\nWhen Spring arrived, there was magic is in the air. That is what makes this book work for me and why I suspect that it still survives alongside other childrens classics. Frances Hodgson Burnett captures that feeling of magic that in many ways exist in the natural world around us. There are elements that felt wrong to me reading in 2017, but omniscient POV, idealised social situations, and outdated attitudes were, unfortunately, the norm when the novel was written so they didn't spoil my enjoyment  just deducted one star as a writer with a conscience. But that star magically re-appeared.","summary":"Magical return to the past","unixReviewTime":1498867200,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

Mary Lennox is spoiled and contrary, living a life no child should have to endure.  She lives in India but has no involvement or love from her parents.  They have left her care to servants and she never knew discipline or love or friendship.  Thus, she was a horrible and ill-tempered tyrant of a child.  When her parents die from cholera she is sent to live in her uncle's manor in Yorkshire.\n\nHer uncle has issues of his own, always staying by himself as he is in permanent mourning for his beautiful deceased wife. He is also a hunchback and feared that his only child, a son named Colin, would develop a hunchback as well.  He never interacts with the child and so Colin is kept pretty much locked away.  Since Colin is never out of doors or running about as young boys should, he is weak and sickly.\n\nMary discovers him one day  each child was completely unaware of the other in this large lonely mansion.  This is the beginning of a friendship for them although they do have their rocky moments and shouting matches.  Their developing friendship is beneficial to them both as Colin eventually goes outside and starts to live as a young boy should.  Mary in turn softens her demeanor and learns about giving and friendship and love.\n\nWhat I liked about this old classic was reading about the Yorkshire moors.  I also liked how Mary would refer to herself as getting fatter as her appetite improved and she put some flesh on her bones.  In India it was so hot that she languished, never played and ate little.  The heat was so great she didn't have an appetite.  But the descriptor as getting fatter was a positive in language and literature in the era this book was published.  Today being called fat is a shaming mechanism.\n\nWhen Mary fist arrived at her uncles manor she met a servant named Martha.  Martha plays a good role in this story and is helpful in getting Mary to examine her life.  Martha asks Mary is she likes the moor and Mary replies that she hates it. Thats because thart not used to it, Martha said, Tha thinks its too big an bare now.  Its fair and lovely in Spring and Summer when gorse and broom an heathers in flower.  It smells of honey and theres lots of fresh air,.\nMary comes to love the moors.\n\nFood mentions are brief.  Colin comments I do wish the slices of ham were thicker, and one muffin each is not enough for any one.\nColin and Mary have breakfasts of homemade bread and fresh butter, snow white eggs, raspberry jam and clotted cream.","summary":"Slow but steady","unixReviewTime":1496188800,"vote":null,"image":null}

Royce.\n  \"Yes, exactly!\" said Korn.  \"Furthermore, I predict a futures bonanza for that particular commodity in the coming months.\"\n  Dancing around the room, Royce spontaneously burst into song and merriment, singing parts of a lively tune he must have heard on the radio a long time ago that had been stuck in the farthest recesses of his brain, escaping only now:\n  \"When I was a little biddy baby my mama used to rock me in my cradle,\n  In them old cotton fields down home.\n  We used to live in a run-down shack, just about a mile from the Frisco track,\n  In them old cotton fields down home.\n  When those cotton balls turn rotten, you can't pick very much cotton,\n  In them old cotton fields down home.\"\n  \"A folk legend is born.  I wish I had a banjo.  Do you know the words to 'Sixteen Tons' by Ernie Ford? You must be feeling down-right sentimental, even nostalgic,\"  Korn chimed in, smirking and carrying-on a little despite himself and his normally reserved demeanor.\"\n  \"I may not be able to sing like Johnny Cash, but three months on special assignment to an undisclosed, isolated, uninhabited, and remote tropical island, reportedly located somewhere in the South China Sea tends to make you appreciate home,\" Royce said.\n  \"We should count our blessings that our next stop isn't a quaint and tidy little garden spot located within the Arctic Circle somewhere north of Korea,\" said Korn.\n  \"All God's children get weary when they roam. Don't it make you want to go home, Lord?  Don't it make you want to go home?\" sang Royce, a \"Joe South and the Believers\" tune.  \"But, now you're talking Politics!\" he said, as a matter of fact.\n  They continued to maintain camouflaged and black-out conditions, with strict radio silence.  Royce monitored some satellite imagery instruments.  Korn checked the cameras strategically placed on the surrounding perimeter.  They were prepared to react quickly and move at a moment's notice.\n  \"Quiet!  Don't look now, but we may have a visitor,\" said Korn, observing a live-camera feed.  As the intruder approached, he recognized a friendly, familiar reconnaissance scout.  Evidently, Special Forces had sent them a message from \"the Pueblo\" to be hand-delivered in person.  Their immediate future would hang in the balance.\n  \"Code-name 'Amelia Erhardt' at your service,\" stated Major Thomas frankly, an Army Ranger and pilot, her flashing eyes beaming like a lighthouse beacon, her golden-blonde hair neatly cut into the style of a French Poodle, as she calmly and softly stepped into the grass hut, which had long served as their hidden lair, through an open door-way.\n  \"Greetings, Meghan!  What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?  Good news first. \" specified Royce.\n  \"Looking for Livingston, naturally.  What are you guys doing here?  The good news:  you were voted least likely to go out in a blaze of glory back at HQ.\" she said.  \"Just kidding.  I really came to see you.\"\n  At this juncture of the dialogue, Korn cheerfully contributed a few heart-felt chorus lines from 'Ring of Fire' to the conversation.  \"Hallelujah, amen!\" he concluded, with a meek smile.  He innocently offered up a sigh of relief.\n  \"You two really know how to defuse a situation and reduce the tension in the room,\" said Royce.  \"What's the bad news?\"\n  \"You've been scheduled to observe an air-assault and demolitions exercise up close and personal.  But, if you'd rather do Karaoke, we can talk about 'Time Love and Tenderness,' said Meghan.  Or, you can tell me all about  'When a Man Loves a Woman.'\"\n  \"Mission top-secret, destination unknown,\" replied Royce.\n  The Secret Garden, a novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett, was first published in 1911.  The delightfully charming story about three young children, Colin, Dickon, and Mary possesses all of the endearing qualities to become a timeless classic of English literature.\n  The children have banded together and become friends in an idyllic, pastoral setting.  Due to the severe limitations imposed upon them by a sometimes rather harsh human existence, they attempt to rise above their circumstances in life.  Despite having sustained grievous injuries, they soon learn that they must persevere if they are to overcome adversity.  They must make a gallant effort to negotiate the obstacles and pit-falls which they encounter along the path toward achieving their goals.  Often, they succeed only through sheer determination and pure will-power.  Because of the process of evolution, which obviously must be at work somehow in their universe--or perhaps because of other, even more powerful forces, there is an almost sublime interaction among the characters in their rite of passage.  The trio reminds me of the plight of the Tin-Man, the Straw-Man, and Dorothy in \"The Wizard of Oz.\"  Indeed, their growth and personal development seems to involve a great many ordeals of mind over matter.  Hence, the story actually appears to portray the triumph of the indomitable human spirit.

It reads like an old-fashioned melodrama from the 1930s - as if Mark and Delia Owens were channeling Edgar Rice Burroughs.  Delia is trapped in a flimsy little tent by two huge lions!  Jeepers!  Delia and Mark are deep in the Kalahari desert without any water!  Oh no!  A raging wildfire is headed straight for their research camp!  Good grief!\n\nWill our intrepid duo survive these perils?  Not to mention black mambas, surly rebels, and a diet of mealie-meal?  Tune in next week, or in this case, keep turning the pages for another thrilling chapter!\n\nSeriously though, as a retired scientist (who worked in a nice climate-controlled laboratory), I have tremendous admiration for what the Owens did in Botswana.  Their dedication, perseverance, and attention to detail epitomize what field work is about.  COTK is not an account of their research findings, but a personal account of what it was like out there.\n\nThere is good science here.  Their discovery that brown hyenas breed communally was a fascinating achievement.  As well, the Owens comparison of lion behavior in the Kalahari with that observed by Schaller in the Serengeti was very important.  To have a comprehensive picture of a keystone predator like lions, we must know how they adapt to very different environments.  Well done, Mark and Delia.","summary":"exciting read!","unixReviewTime":1461542400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Newhart","reviewText":"In the 1970's, Mark and Delia Owens headed into the Central Kalahari of Botswana with few possessions and the goal to study wildlife, in particular predators, in an environment untouched by human activity.  They arrived with little money to acquire the equipment needed for their studies, but over their seven years in the region, they managed to receive enough grant money to keep the project going and focused mainly on lions, brown hyenas, and jackals.\n\nIn this account of their journey and studies, they share insights into animal behaviour as well as stories about the individual animals they had come to know and care about (their actual research has been published elsewhere).  This is also the story of their survival in such a harsh, uninhabited land.\n\nThe Owens' faced a common problem when it comes to wildlife researchers, and this is remaining an objective observer.  In times of drought, they were forced to pour out water and bury remains of food so that animals wouldn't become dependant on handouts.  Also, they had to resist the urge to play with young, curious, hyenas.  While they did very well for the most part, I have to wonder about the part habituation to trucks and people played in the deaths by hunters of some of their favorite animals, including the lion Bones.  This is perhaps an impossible dilemma to resolve (how to observe animals without leaving an impact with your presence), and I feel for the most part the Owens' did very well with it, but they did accustom animals to humans and the animals weren't too know that not all humans were friendly researchers.  On the other hand, the deaths of the animals they studied were heartbreaking and I don't know how they managed to steel themselves to impartiality at all.  They certainly did far better than I would have!\n\nHaving travelled to Botswana in April 2011, it is interesting to see what has changed and what has not in the past 35 years.  The veterinary fences are still a huge controversy, and the debate over the role of hunting in conservation remains, but Maun has definitely grown from the sleepy village it was in the Owens' time there.\n\nI am interested to read some of the Owens' later works as well, which deal with their experiences in Zambia and their interactions with animals and poachers.","summary":"Cry of the Kalahari","unixReviewTime":1307404800,"vote":null,"image":null}

I enthusiastically agree with the praise and plan to read their other books.  In fact, I dropped the book I was currently reading in order to finish this one. I was immediately attracted to the story of two young Americans arriving in Africa with modest funds but determined to do research not previously attempted.  The story is all-the-more compelling given the fact that they were going into an area that people tended to shun as too remove and not even slightly hospitable.\n\nMark and Delia Owens write incredibly well and do not waste words. They describe the animals, people and places with phrases that bring them to life.\n\nA sample picked a random:\n\n\"A near total silence crept in on me when I opened my eyes and gazed at the Land Rover ceiling. A moment's confusion; where was I? I turned to the window. A gnarled acacia tree loomed outside, its limbs held up in silhouette against the grey sky. Beyond the tree, in soft easy lines, the wooded sand dunes descended to the riverbed. Morning, our first in Deception Valley, grew in the sky far beyond the dunes.\"\n\nOne could cite many examples that stimulate interest and draw the reader into the experience of Mark and Delia as the alternate the telling of the work. Also the values held by the authors that they will leave as little a footprint as possible is one shared by those serious about conservation, so we share in their decision and agonize with them when they have to make a tough decision. When the lioness called Bones shows so badly wounded with porcupine quills I found myself cheering the Owens' on as they made the decision to lend some needed medical help rather than let her die.  Perhaps interfering with nature but the authors are careful not to impose their presence when animals were hunting unless they were protecting an animal they had darted.\n\nSome readers may disagree with the close proximity Mark and Delia Owens have with some of the animals, and the \"cute\" names they give to some of the animals, but unlike some wildlife proponents the Owens' are allowing the animals to be curious about them and do not seek to befriend wild animals.  They are not trying to prove that wild animals are safe and (although there are some tense moments when Mark seems to be getting too close for safety) the authors often retreat to their Land Rover.\n\nBeautifully written and illustrated with many black and white photographs, \"Cry of the Kalahari\" is a remarkable book","summary":"A Beautifully Written Book","unixReviewTime":1211241600,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

I've heard grad students' lives are poor and hard, but this couples'  7 year field study takes the mealie-meal.  They carefully rationed water and gasoline and lived on mealie-meal (cornmeal), ostrich eggs, and antelope meat; they'd nearly run out of money and write grants to pay for their supplies only and with no money left to fly home.  They survived on these paltry sums and did their research in temperatures that sometimes got as high as 120 degrees Fahrenheit surrounded by lions, leopards, and cheetahs in the midst of one of Africa's most inhospitable areas.\n\nThis true story is truly amazing and I can't wait to read their other books about Africa.  The book was published in 1984 and I wonder if their research had any influence in the IMAX film The Serengeti which is about the greatest wildebeest migration that happens in the Serengeti area in Tanzania and Kenya.  In the back of the book is a brief recommendation for wildlife management in the Kalahari desert.

I would have given it 5 stars then.  But when I re-read it last year, I realized it belongs alongside the Timothy Treadwell books\/films and the Ian Hamilton (elephants) documentaries\/books, about people endangering the very animals they love through relentlessly habituating them to people and pestering them to the point where Hamilton and the Owens', at least, are lucky to have escaped with a whole skin.  This whole trend toward getting as close as possible to large dangerous animals is so detrimental to the animals themselves that it infuriates me.\n\nThe Owens' lions, used to people letting them roam around camp and sit down among them, and anthropomorphized with cute names like Muffin, were clearly going to get into trouble the first time they met other, less starry-eyed people in the Kalahari or in the villages and towns surrounding it. The Owens did them a real disservice.\n\nThat being said, and if you can ignore that aspect of it, this  remains an interesting read - the camplife and the desert landscape are fascinating, and I believe that, at the time the authors carried out their project, the dangers of habituation, etc., were still not fully understood...","summary":"A Good Read but the Start of a Dangerous Trend","unixReviewTime":1140739200,"vote":42.0,"image":null}

They try to defend  wildlife at all costs which eventually leads to resentment of villagers  towards wildlife and thus no incentive to protect it.\nThr Owenses are  no longer allowed into the democratic country of Botswana.  And I don't  blame Botswana.  I was offended at how they portrayed the Tswana (the  dominant ethnic group of Botswana) as nothing but a threat to wildlife.  Cry of the Kalahari gives the impression that the Tswana and the bushmen of  the Kalahari have no right to use the resources of their land and should be  dislocated elsewhere.\nTheir discription of the wildebeast fencing  problem in inaccurate.  They were not the first to report it as they  claimed and in fact they never did a formal study of the fencing problem  before they screamed out to the international community for help.  Turns  out fences help wildlife as well as hurt is by keeping cattle out of  protected zones and thus free buffalo, wildebeasts and others from having  to compete with them.\nThe Owenses do an excellent job describing wildlife  and tell a captivating story but they take a step backwards in trying to  conserve the animals they love.  By giving the impression that all cattle,  all people and all development is evil they propogate the myths of Africa  that many more enlightened Botswana park service officials have been trying  to dispell.","summary":"A+ Wildlife, F- Conservation","unixReviewTime":966124800,"vote":50.0,"image":null}

But Mark and Delia Owens find a happy medium between the two extremes, one  where we learn a lot about the lions, brown hyenas and other animals they  study in the Kalahari desert, but also come to know some of the individuals  among these animals as friends.\nWe also get a taste of life in the  Kalahari desert in the middle of Botswana, some of the hardships and  life-threatening situations encountered by the Owenses.  And we share the  issues and concerns they tried to raise in the governments and landowners  of the territories where they spent seven years living and studying  animals.\nAt various times this book made me smile.  It made me mad.  It  made me sad.  It made me laugh.

I had downloaded the Kindle book a while ago and when I logged on to Audible, I found I could get the audiobook for free since I had purchased the corresponding Kindle book. I am quite glad that I read the book. I added it to my list of books to read before you die. It quite an uplifting story and would be great for anyone to read.\n\nThe story follows 10 year old Miss Mary. She grew up in India with her parents until cholera wiped out her household. When she was little, she was raised by her nurse and was given anything she wanted. Everyone had to listen to her and do what she said. So when everyone was gone, she didn't really know what to do. She was sent to live with her uncle in England. Her uncle was very hands off and left her to her own devices. Between her maid, the housekeeper, and a gardener, she slowly transitions from a spoiled, bored, sickly child to a rather independent, lively child who enjoys gardening. She is encouraged by everyone to spend as much time outdoors to improve her health and strength. She meets Dicken, her maid's brother who has a strong affinity for animals and talking to him helps her see the world differently. She finds her way into a garden that has been shut-up and hidden for a decade. Between her and Dicken they begin to bring the garden to life and the changes they make there begin to reflect themselves in the spirits and health of the young ones. Mysterious crying in the house leads to a new discovery the helps to bring the magic of the secret garden completely to life.\n\nI think the story is a great message to everyone. It teaches about the importance of not being spoiled and lazy. It shows acceptance of disabilities and illustrates the power of thoughts. I found the story to be highly enjoyable and engaging. The writing was simple and fun to read. The language was not extremely difficult but it did provide vocabulary that most children now-a-days do not hear very often. It is also told from the child's point of view so it will be very easy for children to relate to. Even as an adult, I was able to connect with the story. The simple lessons taught throughout that I mentioned before are relevant even to an adult's life and it helps to see the world through their eyes. I highly recommend this book if you have never read it before.","summary":"A Jem","unixReviewTime":1484179200,"vote":14.0,"image":null}

Solinas","reviewText":"Kenneth Oppel, best known for writing about bats, seems to be channelling the spirit of Jules Verne in \"Airborn,\" a wildly imaginative new fantasy book. Between mysterious flying beasts and pirate attacks, Oppel gives readers a glimpse of life aboard an airship... if airships, not planes, were the major way to travel.\n\nMatt Cruse is on the crow's nest, as the \"ship's eyes,\" when he catches a glimpse of a sinking airship. The dying balloonist dies shortly afterward -- but not before telling Matt about glorious winged creatures. Matt dismisses these as hallucinations -- but one year later, a routine cruise on the airship Aurora becomes something more when the dead man's granddaughter Kate arrives. Wealthy but treated like a nuisance, Kate is determined to find whatever her grandfather saw.\n\nShe shows Matt her grandfather's writings about these winged creatures, and Matt is slowly convinced that the old man wasn't just hallucinating. But their investigations are interrupted by a sudden pirate attack -- which leaves the Aurora sinking from a rip in its envelope. Soon the airship and her crew and passengers are stranded on a deserted island, which may hold the secret to Kate's winged beasts... but it also holds the pirates.\n\nOppel really hits his stride in this book, mixing science with science fiction and wrapping it in a fantasy tortilla. While his bat books were quite good, \"Airborn\" has the rare quality of slipping readers into his imagined universe. It's one of those stories that can be easily imagined as a reality, even if we do have planes and not airships. He even describes how creatures like the cloud cats could fly, were they real.\n\nAfter the initial rescue, which gets readers hooked into the story, Oppel takes his time to unfold the plot, described in careful detail and with plenty of rich skyborne atmosphere. His setting seems to be, like Hayao Miyazaki's \"Castle in the Sky,\" a mix of old and new -- while it's full of airships and similar technology, the attitudes seem to be that of the Victorian or Edwardian era.\n\nThe pre-pirate plot is a bit slow, but very necessary -- Oppel introduces readers to the Aurora, her chummy crew, and the rich passengers they ferry over the ocean. It also gives Kate and Matt time to get to know each other -- for real, not merely \"we're two teens in the same place, we're friends! And maybe more someday!\"\n\nSpeaking of Matt and Kate, they are definitely good lead characters. Matt is \"airborn,\" a kid born in an airship and now at home nowhere except in the sky, even though his father died there. Kate is a good counterpoint, since she is everything Matt is not -- wealthy, adventurous, and all too willing to let people know when she is frustrated. The supporting characters, from the prissy chaperone to the genial captain, are also well-drawn; the only exception is rich boy Bruce, who doesn't get much time.\n\nReportedly he is working on a sequel, which is not surprising. Kenneth Oppel created a rich new fantasy world in \"Airborn,\" with plenty of sky left to explore.","summary":"Up and \"Airborn\"","unixReviewTime":1100908800,"vote":33.0,"image":null}

Matt serves aboard a passenger ship known as the Aurora.  However, this ship is no boat.  This is an airship, one that sets the tone for the slightly steampunk adventure.  Early on, Matt meets Kate, a girl looking for mysterious creatures her uncle once sighted near where the Aurora flies.  Matt and Kate develop a friendship, and throughout this their characters are developed well enough for the reader to care about them, their struggles, and their relationship.  The story really speeds up about half-way through the book, and Matt, Kate and others will have to risk everything for their lives, and the lives of others.  To go on past that would thoroughly spoil the narrative.  This novel will captivate readers with a mix of action and mystery.  Airborn is narrated by Matt, and that tremendously adds to the experience.  Kenneth Oppel's great writing is filled with playful figurative language and a few jokes that are very funny, but they don't affect the mood of the plot.  This book would get a perfect score, but it's somewhat slow beginning is something of a pain, despite its valuable setup for the rest of the story.  Though the beginning of a wonderful trilogy, Airborn is also a great read on it's own.  For those who like action, adventure, and a bit of fantasy, Airborn is very difficult to beat.","summary":"A Fantastic Adventure","unixReviewTime":1499990400,"vote":null,"image":null}

The discovery of a secret garden leads to the awakening of young spirits and the healing of young lives.\n\nThis lovely novel radiates with joy and finds the drama in regeneration as Mary transforms into a happy, empathetic child while coaxing a garden back to life, then passes on the gift by helping another to do the same.  The character of her friend and confidante Dickon may strain credibility at times with his Doctor Doolittle-like ability to charm animals, but this a small quibble of a narrative that eschews violent conflict or selfish antagonists for one in which everyone seems to be doing the best they can, and the drama arises from within as they try to do better.  Frances Burnett Hodgsons keen psychological insights into wounded children with traumatic pasts prevents the story from ever becoming dull, and her descriptions of plants and wildlife are lovely.  This is a truly enriching read, and it makes me wonder what Hodgson would make of the slew of depressive dystopian novels that characterize so much of childrens literature today.","summary":"The Secret Garden","unixReviewTime":1482796800,"vote":null,"image":null}

They feature great characters in exciting adventures in a really clever steampunk setting and as soon as I read them they became \"instant classics\" and I've put them on the shelf I've reserved for my very favorite books right alongside Hornblower, Harry Potter, His Dark Materials, and the Lord of the Rings.\n\nI'll try to explain what makes these books so wonderful without giving away any spoilers.\n\nThe Characters\nIn his two lead characters -- Matt Cruse and Kate de Vries -- Oppel has created exactly the kind of characters I love: they are charming, brave, kind, but most of all, smart. I love smart characters who *think* their way out of problems. They work hard when hard work is required, they study carefully when knowledge is required, and they spring into action when bold deeds are required. They have the same fears and doubts that every kid, every person, has, yet they have the courage to overcome those fears and take action. The two really come alive as you read the book until you feel like they're real people.\n\nThe Relationship\nIt wouldn't be a YA series without a romance, and this series has one -- the best I've seen, in fact.\n\nNot too long ago, back when YA lit was still being called \"Juvenile Fiction,\" most of the books featured a main male character and a secondary (usually very secondary) female character. Which wasn't very balanced or very fair -- or probably of much interest to female readers. In recent YA fiction that dynamic has been reversed, with main female characters and very secondary male characters.\n\nBut how is that any better? It's not balancing any scales since the audience that read those older books has grown up and moved on. Is it some form of revenge or payback? If so, they're taking revenge on readers who weren't even born when the offending literature was written. And what does that really teach kids? That all relationships, both personal and professional, have to be one-sided, that there's always going to be a dominate member and a submissive member? I don't accept that. I wouldn't accept a relationship like that and I don't want my kids to accept relationships like that.\n\nThat's what makes the relationship at the heart of this series so great. It starts out as a genuine friendship between two people who respect each other and it blossoms into a beautiful romance that is also very realistic in its highs and lows, it's triumphs and obstacles.\n\nMatt Cruse starts out as a working class cabin boy on the luxury airship Aurora. He loves his job, he loves traveling the world, and he hopes to move up in the ranks and make a career out of the air service. Kate de Vries starts out as a daughter of high society who yearns for a career as a naturalist, like her beloved grandfather, and who is already extremely knowledgable in her field. Science may be a man's world but Kate refuses to be held back on account of her gender. She's setting out to prove her grandfather's theories correct and in so doing, to make a name for herself and prove that women can have an impact in the sciences.\n\nKate is smart, bold, and courageous -- but she can be overzealous in pursuit of her goals. Matt is no less smart, though not formally educated like Kate, and no less courageous -- but he also has a keen sense of responsibility and a look-before-you-leap level head that is an excellent balance to Kate's impulsiveness.\n\nThat's where they start -- where they go from there is yours to discover.\n\nThe Stories\nThe stories are fantastic -- pirates, exploration, desert islands, strange discoveries the books have it all! But despite the pirates and the very real danger presented to themselves and others they care about, our heroes never resort to violent solutions. They prefer to think their way out of their problems.\n\nThe Setting\nThe books are set in a great steampunk-style world which is just different enough from ours to instill a sense of wonder but not so different or outlandish that it loses all applicability to our own world. Readers will recognize, and empathize, with all the problems and obstacles that Matt and Kate face.\n\nThe Downside\nIt's really hard to find anything negative to say about these books but if I had to chose *something* it would probably be that in the world of the book's setting, France and Canada dominate the world in science and industry (France and Canada?!) and no mention is made of Great Britain or the United States. Some will say this is a refreshing change of pace, and it is, in a way. But it also ignores all the things that made GB and the US the actual dominate forces in our real history, which is rather strange for a book which is otherwise so willing to grapple with issues of classism, sexism, corporate greed, and the power of science over fanaticism. I've come to believe that it's never a good idea to ignore history, especially the history we don't necessarily like. But that's a minor, minor quibble.","summary":"Among The Best \"Young Adult\" Books I've Read","unixReviewTime":1459296000,"vote":null,"image":null}

An orphan girl, Mary, is left to roam about on her uncle's estate without having to go to school. She can run and play outdoors unchaperoned and, when she gets hungry, show up at meal times. Moreover, when it rains, she can explore the 100-room mansion like it was her private playground. Who wouldn't love to have such a life especially as a child? Yes, she's lonesome, but she develops friendships. Her parents' deaths from cholera don't seem to have affected her at all since they neglected her.\n\nThere's a sweetness to the first half of the book. I especially enjoyed the growing friendship between Mary and Martha and Mary's transformation from a sullen, spoiled child. I also enjoyed exploring with Mary, finding the key to the secret garden, and discovering the secret garden itself. It felt a little like a Nancy Drew mystery.\n\nThe problem, unfortunately, was when Colin appeared about halfway through the story. The focus shifted away from Mary as the central character to Colin and his health problem and tantrums. Mary was subsequently pushed to the back burner. At this point, the story became tedious. I skimmed to the end where Mrs. Medlock sees Mr. Craven and his son walking side by side. We're given a happy ending, but again, Mary is shunted aside and disappears at the end.","summary":"Overrated \"Classic\"","unixReviewTime":1482278400,"vote":null,"image":null}

With the airship and the alternate technology it is steampunk, but that aspect isn't heavily featured and the tech frames and informs the story but doesn't dominate it. In a similar vein, there's swashbuckling adventure that makes this a direct descendant of high seas pirate adventures, but again that's mostly for flavor and atmosphere.\n\nOur two primary characters, mild and modest but daring and stalwart Matt, and sassy, spirited Kate, carry the burden of the story effortlessly. Matt is an engaging narrator. Kate is a worthy and equal companion in adventure. Neither is loaded with quirks and while they aren't developed deeply they are fleshed out as completely as necessary for this type of adventure.\n\nThis is a modest, well crafted, imaginative, good-hearted, good-humored adventure. It's crisp, clear, fast paced and briskly plotted. It doesn't always go for big effects, and its appeal to me was built up from a number of small observations, events, descriptions, bits of dialogue and characters. That's what made it seem especially appealing for newer and younger readers testing the water for this type of fiction. As such, it struck me as a fine and entertaining introduction to the genre.","summary":"When Light is Just Right","unixReviewTime":1442188800,"vote":6.0,"image":null}

It's exciting and full of varied adventures.\n\nThe bad: the plot relies heavily on coincidence, culminating in a deus ex machina. Also challenging the suspension of disbelief are some conspicuous science fails.\n\nOK, I was willing to bracket the gas that's lighter than hydrogen, completely inert, and smells of mangoes, and set it aside in the name of enjoying the story, even though that makes no sense in chemistry, physics or biology. But there's no way that you could trap enough of it in a pair of (untreated) silk harem pants to lift two teenagers, who have to weigh at least 200 pounds between them, probably more. This would be true even if they weren't rising through <i>more of the same gas<\/i>, which reveals that the author has no clue about physics whatsoever.\n\nThe coincidences, though, are much harder on the suspension of disbelief.\n\n<spoiler>The main character happens to rescue a man who's passing in a balloon. The man's granddaughter happens to be a passenger on the same ship a year later. (OK, maybe she deliberately went on the ship that rescued her grandfather, though I don't recall that being mentioned). The ship happens to be attacked by pirates, who happen to cause it to crash, though it happens to make it to an uncharted island a thousand miles from anywhere else, where the grandfather had seen strange creatures and written about them in his journal. This happens to be the pirates' base, and by this point I am over-coincidenced. But wait! here's more! The strange creatures turn up again, just in time to rescue Our Hero from the pirate leader, almost like some kind of god being let down out of a machine.<\/spoiler>\n\nIt's a tribute to the storytelling that I still enjoyed this, despite these serious issues. I don't think I will read the sequel, though.","summary":"Enjoyable, despite excessive coincidence and science fails","unixReviewTime":1431820800,"vote":null,"image":null}

While the book is written for a teen audience, the plot, characters and writing are complex enough to engage an adult.  The story is set in an \"alternate\" earth where airships, not airplanes, dominate the skies.  Oppel mixes actual earth locations with fictitious ones creating a geography that is familiar, but not identical to ours.  The chronology is set about a century ago, but this is where the book shares characteristics with Hayao Miyazaki's movies:  technology of several different eras are present simultaneously.\n\nThe story is set largely aboard the luxury airship Aurora, and is narrated by the cabin boy Matt Cruze.  It begins with a midair rescue which sets the stage for the main adventure a few months later.  Two mysteries presented by the opening are resolved through the rest of the book with one major twist occurring.\n\nThe book entertains on multiple levels.  Oppel includes social commentary in character dialog, but keeps focused on the main mystery and plot.  One does not get a detailed description of the world outside the airship, but sees little glimpses of that world from descriptions of the characters and their lives.  The world of the airship is described in much greater depth, but without becoming bogged down in details, and the information given is actually essential to later events.\n\nOver all, \"Airborn\" is fun, giving the reader a pleasant diversion to another place, and for those who like word-play, a nice title!","summary":"Airborn by Kenneth Oppel is an excellent escape from the mundane","unixReviewTime":1419724800,"vote":null,"image":null}

The book grabs you from the very beginning and never let's go. It follows the story of boy in his early teens (15 or 16) that is a cabin boy on an airship. While the boy, Matt, is on watch duty he spots a hot air balloon that's been damaged and they proceed to give assistance. There is an old man in the balloon, it's only occupant, and he is badly injured. Before he dies he tells young Matt about a beautiful flying creature that no one has ever seen before. But his ranting and raving are passed of as the words of a confused dieing man. Then a year later Matt meets the old mans granddaughter who's is hell bent on proving her grandfather actually did see a real creature. And thus begins a thrill ride of an adventure that you won't want to put down until you reach the last page.\n\nMy thoughts on the book:\n\nI finished this book a little over 2 days while I was on vacation. The characters are very well written, you get a good sense of who they are and become very attached to the few leading characters. The two main characters are Matt Cruse and Kate de Vries. Matt is a level headed young man who thinks everything through and does it quickly and doesn't hesitate to act when he thinks it's needed. He is very adapt on the air ship, and because he has spent so much time on them he know what everything does as well as every inch of them.\n\nKate on the other hand is a strong willed young woman who doesn't let anything get in the way of her goal, and this gets her into trouble, as well as Matt, throughout the book. Kate is definitely not your average female who is helpless, she is very well studied and reads a lot of books and is very knowledgeable about things Matt has never dreamed of knowing about. That being said she does relay on him for some of the more practical things such as how to find there way back when they go traipsing through the jungle.\n\nAll in all I really enjoyed this book it reminded me of some of the Jules Vern books I have read. Very fun and enjoyable read.","summary":"Airborn","unixReviewTime":1402963200,"vote":null,"image":null}

On one of his trips, Matt helps rescue a balloonist, whose last words and journal seem to indicate he's seen flying animals so far unidentified by science. They drift above an uncharted island in the \"Pacificus.\"\n\nWhen the balloonist's granddaughter, Kate, arrives aboard Matt's airship a year later, she drags him into her quest to locate the island and identify the flying creatures. She feels this will bring meaning to her grandfather's death.\n\nLife above the airship is portrayed in creative and convincing detail. Things get a little less convincing about halfway through the book.\n\nI was happily surprised that the adventure is supplemented with better than average characterization. The budding feelings Matt feels towards the pretty and spunky Kate are well-articulated, and you don't get the unbelievable infatuation-at-first sight so common in this genre. The villain is not uniformly evil; we get a glimpse of his softer side. Even the handsome, rich, seemingly perfect son of the airship's owner shows levels of complexity, whereas such a character is usually portrayed as a boring goody-goody with no brains or a secret scoundrel.\n\nThe biggest shortcoming is of Airborn, unfortunately, one that is common in the YA adventure novel: believability. Do teenagers really save the world\/airship\/mission almost entirely without the assistance of adults? And Matt's ship just \"happens\" to crash on the island identified by the balloonist? Really?\n\nThose issues aside, I think this book will be greatly enjoyed by tweens and teens 12-16.","summary":"Light and entertaining, with better characterization than many similar tween and teen adventure titles","unixReviewTime":1384646400,"vote":null,"image":null}

And it is wonderful. Matt Cruse has always dreamed of working on one of the luxury dirigible (blimp) cruise ships that travel the skies. Matt takes a grunt job on the same ship that employed his father. One day while he is on watch in the crow's nest, he observes a hot air balloon crash. His ship goes to investigate and thus the fantasy adventure begins. Before he dies, the captain of the balloon tells Matt of \"glorious winged creatures filling the sky\". Matt thinks the man was delusional. Of course, he wasn't. Matt and his shipmates, and the passengers on the airship, contend with pirate attacks, deadly storms, being stranded on an uncharted island, cruel villains and of course the sky creatures. Matt's (obligatory) sidekick is Kate, the granddaughter of the man who died in the crash. She is a wealthy passenger on Matt's ship covertly taking up her grandfather's search for the creatures. Although Airborn is a formulaic fantasy adventure, it also has well developed interesting characters, strong science elements and gripping descriptions of the settings and conflicts. Some readers may be put-off by the length of Airborn, and it does drag in parts, but the exciting events leading up to the nail-biting climax more than make up for the tedious sections.","summary":"High Skies Adventure","unixReviewTime":1380412800,"vote":null,"image":null}

My son loved Airborn, and so did I.  This book was for my tastes far better than the typical young adult fare.\n\nFirst, the story itself is entertaining and creative.  It isn't at all formulaic.  It has a good balance between fantasy and reality.  The era is nearly the same as the early 20th century, but there are enough subtle twists to make the reader suspend disbelief and accept the possibility of existence of strange creatures and undiscovered islands.  For instance, the gas used to make the airships ligher than air is called \"hydrium\".  The metal of the airship is \"alumiron\".  There are continents named \"Europa\" and \"North Americus\".  It's just delightful how Oppel's world in Airborn is almost, but not quite, the same as ours.\n\nSecond, this is a really, really well written book.  The writing technique is great.  The mood is consistent and the vocabulary is just right for young adults.  We're told the story from Matt's perspective, and to me his character, that of the female protagonist Kate, as well as the other main characters, are all well developed with just the right amount of introspection.  The descriptions of action are great.  The pace is even, and kept my attention enough that I finished the book in a couple of days.  I've read a lot of young adult fiction, and I really think that Oppel is the best writer for young adults that I've read.\n\nThird, the book is perfect for general audiences.  It shows that you don't need to have a lot of profanity, violence and sex to sell books and interest readers.  My son is a pretty typical teen who likes Eminem, Robin Thicke, South Park, Family Guy, etc.  But he also loved this book.  As a parent, it was great to see my son enjoy a book with a hero who has a sense of duty, works hard and loves his family.  There's no profanity and not much violence (and no graphic violence).  There's certainly romance, but nothing risqu.  One last thing- although the story 's central character is a boy, Matt, I would recommend this book for both boys and girls.  Kate is every bit as interesting and well-developed a character as Matt.","summary":"Wonderful!","unixReviewTime":1377993600,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

The main characters, sixteen year-old Matt Cruse (a cabin boy on the luxury cruiser Aurora from a modest background who's still coming to terms with the death of his father) and wealthy and feisty Kate de Vries, are sympathetic, well-developed and easy to relate to. Together Matt (at first somewhat reluctantly) and Kate embark on finding out the truth about mysterious flying creatures that Kate's grand-father wrote about in his diary before his death.\nSophisticated world-building, adventure, pirates and a hint of romance make for a very entertaining read, with the potential to appeal to teens and adults alike.","summary":"Sophisticated, page-turning adventure","unixReviewTime":1369440000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Takes place in a fictional futuristic Victorian era, where air ships, a la the Hindenberg, take the place of our modern jets.  There are even pirates.  Kate is a good foil for Matt, and I did appreciate his sometimes sarcasm to her.  They are both 15.  Those air ships sailed only hundreds of feet above the ocean, not, as now, 35,000 feet.

People seem to either love this book or hate this book. I am one of the people that love this book, and I'm having difficulties understanding what people didn't like. I saw one reviewer complain about the first person narration (valid, if that's not your deal), some complain about the female lead being annoying (and okay, Kate is a bit haughty)... but one person said the book started too slowly. My only response to this is an inquisitive head tilt and a feeling that we might not be reading the same book. As I review books I am learning that I am a plot reader.  I can deal with books that are primarily about the development of the main character when it's done well (a la John Green's books), but plot is mostly where it's at for me.\n And I thought the plot development of Airborn was fantastic. We start in the ship with Matt Cruse, cabin boy for the airship Aurora. He generally acts as a lookout for the ship and as a waiter for the passengers, but in the very first chapter they spot a hot air balloon is distress. Matt (as the lightest on the ship) has the job of swinging out on to the balloon to hook it so the crew can save the poor old man in the balloon. The man asks Matt if he saw \"them,\" and Matt lies to appease the dying man. Again folks, this is still the first chapter or two.\n Then we jump to two years later, and Matt is stewarding for passenger Kate de Vries, a wealthy girl about his age. He learns that she is the granddaughter of the old man and that she is looking for these odd winged panthers he wrote about in his journal just before his death.  This might be the slow part the review was referring to, but I can't for the life of me see why. From here there's a bit less plot, but we get super-detailed world building about the general goings-on of the ship... until the plot really takes off.\n Another point I was really fond of: Bruce Lombardi is a character that is the \"other guy\" in a lot of respects. He and Matt are in fairly constant competition, but Bruce is still a really likable character (which is especially a feat, considering the first-person narration).  Kate is a bit much to deal with sometimes, but I'd rather have a feisty, bossy heroine over a swoony, blank-page heroine any day. Plus, let's remember that she's young and immature. Hermione was a pain in the first Harry Potter book too, remember?\n So why am I holding back from giving it a 10? I don't really know. I really, really like it, but it's not hitting that book-so-good-I'm-obsessed stage, where I would recommend it to everyone (like White Cat by Holly Black or The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins). Possibly it's because it's so super into its genre, which I feel might be a moderate turn-off for all the reviewers who didn't like it on Goodreads. We shall see if that changes after Skybreaker. Stay tuned!\n\nAdditional Thoughts:  Now that books are available to me in so many formats (and I am without a job outside of school for the first time... possibly ever) I find myself rating books on a monetary betting system. FOr example, I know that I will buy Red Glove in hardback the day it comes out. I loved White Cat that much. Anything by John Green generally also makes the buy first, ask questions later list. Other things, like Anna and the French Kiss get e-readered because I've heard good things, but may not be totally sure they'll be my kind of thing. And then there's the library, where I grab anything and everything.\n This series may have started in the library for me, and it's going to continue in the library due to lack of funds, but at some point in the future there WILL be a complete hardback set with matching covers of this trilogy gracing my shelves. I would definitely re-read Airborn, and from reading the back cover of Skybreaker I imagine the trend is just going to continue.\n This book won a Printz Honor award, so that means official people thought it was awesome too.\n Wikipedia also tells me that there is a movie based on the book due out sometime this year, but they've already tried to adopt it into a movie that didn't pan out in 2008. So the movie might be stuck in movie-limbo right next to the Ender's Game movie (and probably for about the same reasons).\n\nRating: 9: Super-close to perfect","summary":"Awesome adventure book","unixReviewTime":1306195200,"vote":null,"image":null}

(Or in my case listen, since I listened to the audiobook). But no matter how many times I booktalk it, tell my teens about it, and try to really sell it to readers, it still remains a hard book to convince them to take. I'm not sure if that's because the old cover which we have in the library and maybe the paperback cover is helping to remedy that.\n\nI often describe this book as Treasure Island meets Around the World in 80 Days which sometimes will get a reader's attention. With the rise of steampunk, I could see readers looking for more in the genre and picking this one up.\n\nBut if you can find a way to get this into reader's hands and get them to read it, they'll love it! Once I've convinced a reader to pick this one up, they come back raving about it. There's action, adventure, mystery, romance, pirates and strange creatures in the sky. I loved the audiobook because it was done by Full Cast Audio so each character had a different voice and it really made the book feel like a movie. Airborn would make a great classroom or family read aloud because there is something for everyone in the book. It gives such a great nod to the old classic adventures that readers of all ages should enjoy it. There are two sequels so Matt and Kate's adentures do continue, but Airborn wraps things up nicely that it can be read on it's own.\n\nAirborn is a perfect all ages adventure story that will excite readers and leave them wanting more.","summary":"GreenBeanTeenQueen Reviews","unixReviewTime":1282694400,"vote":null,"image":null}

But, for me, this is definitely one of my all-time favorites.\n\nSeldom do I come across a title that has a strong plot, a great writing style, and wonderful characters that are multi-dimensional, real, and vivid.  It felt like every time I tuned in I was visiting with friends.\n\nThis was a fast read, catching me from the start.  The plot is quite unique and kept me surprised and guessing all along the way.\n\nWhat was so refreshing, and immediately apparent, was that the protagonists were *good* characters.  They weren't perfect, but their flaws were normal and understandable--they did want to be good people and do the right things.  This said, this is an adventure book (if I had to pick just ONE genre that is).  However, the book never felt like it was *just* plot driven, nor did it ever feel like it was *just* character driven.  Instead, it was a wonderful, well-paced combination of the two.\n\nA small warning (and minimal spoiler): there are deaths.  Many are not gruesome, and some are simply hinted at (allowing more sensitive readers to infer what they will).  But, there are obvious deaths, some of which might be unnerving for young, sensitive readers.  The descriptions of the deaths are short and not very detailed, but those with active imaginations could find themselves just a tad grossed out at times.  This aside, the story is very sweet, very innocent, and, in my opinion, a wonderful, great, fantastic story!\n\nI listened to the audio version (Full Cast Audios) and was extremely impressed!  This is a full cast recording, so each character has it's own accompanying actor or actress, each of whom I thought brought volumes of details to their characters while still staying very true to the text.\n\nHighly recommended!!!

It truly is a throw back to these authors, not only in the time period, but the style of writing and the strong characters taking part in the adventure. Matt Cruse rivals Stevenson's Jim Hawkins in every way, and the rest of the supporting cast is just as strong. Even the main antagonist carries with him admirable qualities both in refinement and intellect that make him more than the one-dimensional bad guy many books in this genre portray.\n\nOverall, it starts out a little slow, building toward the action, but once Oppel brings the reader into it, there's no turning back. It's not life-altering literature, but it's a great read, taking advantage of the unexplored world of airships in a captivating way. Oppel is an author who's authentic to his fantasy, creating believable worlds with believable characters, even in anthropomorphizing animals, like in his Silverwing Trilogy, a task few take on and even fewer do successfully. As this series advances to explore through the various iterations of the merger between adventure and technology, Matt Cruse's stories, I'm sure, will continue to captivate readers. I recommend this book to both adults and kids, with its main audience falling within the range of 8-13, geared more toward boys.\n\n-Lindsey Miller, [...]","summary":"Fun And Adventurous","unixReviewTime":1239494400,"vote":null,"image":null}

It's a pretty solid story with a strong balance of adventure, fantasy, and character development. The sky flying adventure of Matt and Kate definitely intrigued me. Their journey through the skies was more than fun. Although this isn't the debut of Ken Oppel, i felt there were some basic writing issues with this story. There were definitely some weird structural and stylistic problems with this novel.\n\nHere are the positive notes of Airborn:\n\n+Very creative.\nThe fictional world of Airborn hooked me into the story. Matt Cruse is a cabin boy on the airship Aurora and has a natural gift for flying(and heights).  The world he lives in has airships instead of modern planes, changing the direction of the world transportation. The airships are suspended in air by the fictional gas \"hydrium\" and the world has alternate oceans such as Pacificus and Atlanticus. The world Oppel develops is more than creative; it's efficient and easy to understand.\n\n+Adventure adventure adventure.\nThe entire story has a treasure island feel to it, which is a compliment. Matt is on a search for the cloud cats, fictional animals that fly high in the sky. The search and journey for the cloud cats seemed slightly dubious at first, but it serves a purpose. It definitely points the story in a specific direction.\n\n+characters are worth following.\nMatt Cruse definitely has a franchise feel to him. Adventurous, brave, confident and a foil to his female partner. The story ends on a slightly strange note, but you want to follow Matt and Kate beyond this story. I think their relationship feels somewhat artificial(well, it is fictional), but i can understand it.\n\nThere weren't too many negative aspects about it, but there are a few.\n\n-The story starts out slooooooowww, slightly long.\nI really didn't like the beginning. Mad slow. Turtle slow. The overall story could have been maybe ten thousand words shorter. You get a feel for the fictional world, but i'm not sure if that was the best way. You don't really understand the direction of the plot until maybe 60-70 pages in. Hang in there though, it's worth reading.\n\n-Very weird structure.\nThere's a weird time skip in the beginning and the main female character pops up somewhat randomly. It's not exactly smooth. When pirates attack the ship Aurora, the ship goes down near a island. The entire time they're trying to regain control of the ship and find a way to get it back. There are slow parts, fast parts, it's all back and forth. It's not unconventional, but it definitely felt forced at times.\n\n-The narration isn't the best.\nSo maybe this is an opinion and it could be a minor thing, but it's not my fav narration. I felt the story moved slowly because the narrator tried too hard to explain a lot of issues. Maybe it didn't need narration, maybe it did. I honestly believe the character development would have happened anyway so i'm not sure if i enjoyed Matt tried to explain everything.\n\nTo end simply, I really liked the story. It's creative, adventurous, and has solid characters with a solid premise. Personally, i think the story will appeal to the younger readers who have the patience to read through the slow start. I haven't read the rest of the trilogy, but i'm looking forward to it.","summary":"fun and creative with a weird story structure","unixReviewTime":1239062400,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

Carlson","reviewText":"This book had me hooked from page one.  Young Matt Cruise, cabin boy aboard the luxury airship \"Aurora,\" adores flying. With three generations of air force pilots in my family, and my own fascination with everything that flies, I understood him at once.  More at home in the sky than on the ground, he dreams of working his way up to ship's captain one day.  Then, a routine voyage turns into high flying adventure with sky pirates, crash landings, uncharted islands, typhoons, and a girl with a camera determined to find evidence for a creature that no one else believes exists.\n\nThink of this book as a cross between Jules Verne and Robert Louis Stevenson, with a delightful dose of humor thrown in.  Sure, the constant hair breadth escapes strain the willing suspension of disbelief, but that's why they call it escapist fiction right?  Everyone keeps having narrow escapes.  That's what makes it fun.\n\nAs much as I liked Matt, I found the girl character a bit tedious.  She was bold, stubborn, plucky, and that was about it.  Clueless for such a well educated lass, her poor decisions necessitated a few extra narrow escapes.  Not my kind of heroine.\n\nEven if they weren't the most subtle and sophisticated characters, the cast certainly had a lot of personality.  My favorite character may have been the airship \"Aurora\" itself, so well described in the book I almost felt like I'd been aboard myself.\n\nA very entertaining book.

Well, for that, you need to classify \"Airborn\" as science fiction, which it's not. Then again, it's not historical fiction either. So what is it? A pure adventure tale, and a wonderful one at that.\n\n\"Airborn\" presents us with a world of blimps, airships, and wondrous things. Our main character, Matt Cruse, is first introduced to us as the brave, talented kid who saves a man from a balloon that's about to crash. This encounter with the dying man means that one year on, Matt joins forces with a stubborn girl, determined to discover and prove the existence of a new species that her grandfather (the dying man) wrote of in his journals.\n\n\"Airborn\" seems to take place in the past. Kate de Vries (our girl main character) is forced to travel with a chaperon, is constantly told what's appropriate for girls, and is considered strange for her spunk and attitude. There are incredible class differences, and that's one of the more interesting aspects of \"Airborn\", one that's not so obvious.\n\nPerhaps the only flaw \"Airborn\" really has is that Matt seems to get out of too many tight squeezes. He is immensely talented when it comes to airships, seemingly knowing EVERYTHING. This tendency made me raise my eyebrows a few times, but then again, it's his job. Matt is a rather simple character, just a boy who loves the sky and loves flying. Kate is a good example of a girl who goes out of her way to do what she wants (spoiled, stubborn, and determined) and is determined to know everything and succeed. Their dialogue is always interesting and keeps the story moving.\n\n\"Airborn\" moves at a quick, exciting pace. It's impossible to put down, even for a moment.

There is so much goodness in this book that I want to eat it just to get every last bit of goodness out and have it for my very own.\n\nThis book is good enough to justify giving the author some slack when he makes up really lame terms for things in his alternate world such a \"hydrium\" gas, which makes his giant airships float, or \"alumiron\", the strong-but-light metal out of which their huge frames are made. It is good enough to read even though the main characters are a cabin boy and a rich girl of the same age, both with dreams and daddy issues.\n\nThese minor cliches do not matter because this book is really--really!--good. It is funny and sad and real and exciting. It gets the action rolling on the second page and reels you in before it starts deftly feeding you healthy doses of exposition. It has descriptions of lighter-than-air travel that will make you hop online to check out the nearest place where you can charter a dirigible. It has a really cool mysterious creature that does not form an emotional bond or telepathic link with anyone, which is in itself such an original idea that it could float the entire story by itself. (I jest. A little.) It has a plucky rich girl who is forced to stop dreaming long enough to realize that she's really rather selfish and manipulative for all that she's charming and funny.

Hardy","reviewText":"At first glance, Airborn doesn't seem like the ideal adventure book to pick up, but as you read the story you can be sure your first impression is bound to change. Kenneth Oppel has spun something of a marvel here in the form of a fantasy that would make anyone wish for the ability to do what his protagonist, Matt Cruse, does. To be able to fly through the skies toward unknown adventure and unspeakable dangers. Or at least, that's the initial feeling that overcame me. The story is nicely described and doesn't focus too much on Matt's past or his father, - whom he feels closest to when in the air aboard the Aurora; He hates to be landlocked.\n\nSo much to a point his dislike of the ground can be described as a sort of phobia- or the family he leaves behind every time the airship takes to the skies. The characters - minor and major -- are wonderfully represented on page, especially the sometimes brash and overly-adventurous Kate De Vries, whom I figured would be described as the `spoiled brat who wants a life of her own, and yet cannot see past herself.' To my delight she was the complete opposite. Even a character I wanted to despise because of Matt's misfortune, Bruce Lunardi, I ended up liking in the end and was sorely disappointed by the sour hand he was dealt.\n\nOne problem I had with the story was that, my original perceptions of the story were disappointed, but it ended up being better than my expectations. Negative points about Airborn, is that the story seems to just seems to be going through the motions with no solid plot whatsoever, but it turns out it sorta did, just not the kind I expected. All in all I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good adventure-book to read. 7\/27\/06 ---- [a 5 out of 5]","summary":"Nowhere to go but up, up, and away","unixReviewTime":1154044800,"vote":null,"image":null}

This story grabs you, and keeps ahold of you throughout the entire book. I've never been on such a fantastic rollercoaster ride of emotions, adventure and fantasy. Oppell has a wonderful, ingenious imagination. He manages to bring to life things that are found under the sea (with a dash of fantasy) to life up in the air. I knew from the first chapter that this book should be made into a movie; and if that ever happens I will be first in line to see it.\n\nHis second book, SKYBREAKER, is just as good with even more character development. You can't help but fall in love with Matt and Kate and I hope there is a book 3, soon, on the horizon. I HIGHLY recommend this book for adults, teens and even the elementary schooler. If you like Harry Potter, you'll love Matt Cruse in AIRBORN.\n\nMy only complaint: I could not find this book in the average bookstore. My local library had it, but only two copies.

So I picked up this book, which I had been meaning to read. Airborn is in many ways a classic sea-faring swashbuckler of a novel, with a plucky cabin boy, a brave captain, ruthless pirates, terrifying storms, and tragic shipwrecks.\n\nHowever, Airborn features a few quirks. First of all, the ships in the story are airships, like the Hindenburg. The protagonist's ship, the Aurora, is a luxury passenger vessel that uses a lighter-than-air gas to fly, instead of floating on the water. The story is basically an alternate reality, set in the early 1900s, exploring what might have been, if airships had become a primary mode of transportation. Airborn also features sightings of a species of winged cats, undiscovered mammals that live over the ocean, another alternate reality that fascinates the author.\n\nI quite enjoyed this book. The cabin boy, Matt Cruse, is brave and resourceful. He gets dragged into trouble by a wealthy young passenger named Kate, who is herself quite plucky, especially for her historical time period. Matt and Kate's main adversary, a pirate captain named Szpirglas, is also a well-rounded and interesting character, not your cardboard cutout pirate by any means. The story is complex and action-filled, with conflicts arising from nature, pirates, and Matt's troubles with authority.\n\nI think that this book will appeal to teen boys looking for adventure stories, and will have cross-over appeal to girls, too, because Kate is such a strong character. (Kate is very brave, and independent almost to a fault. At one point, she drugs her companion\/guardian, so that she can traipse through the woods on her own, to photograph an elusive and dangerous cloud cat.) I look forward to reading the sequel, Skybreaker.\n\nThis book review was originally published on my blog, Jen Robinson's Book Page, on July 11, 2006.","summary":"A classic seafaring swashbuckler, with a few quirks","unixReviewTime":1152576000,"vote":null,"image":null}

J Nelson","reviewText":"Plot Summary:\n\nImagine a world where airplanes were never invented - a world filled with massive airships.  This is the world of Matt Cruse, a young airship cabin boy who dreams of someday being the captain of his beloved airship home, the Aurora.  One night, he helps rescue a crazy old balloonist who claims to have seen \"wonderful flying creatures.\"  When his granddaughter Kate shows up on a voyage months later, Matt ends up shipwrecked on a dangerous tropical island paradise crawling with cutthroat pirates and deadly typhoons.  And in the background lurks a large white creature with bones lighter than air...\n\nMy Review:\n\nAlthough it is set at a reading level for middle-schoolers, Airborn was recommended to me by a couple of my more advanced fourth graders when I asked them for suggestions.  The second half of the book literally flies with plot twists and action-packed scenes.  It is a book that is hard to put down - one that kept me up until near 2:00am trying to figure out how it would end.  I was planning on reading it slowly over the next couple of weeks, but that was impossible once I got into the story.  The first half of the book is a little slow, but the details and the characterization set up in it are essential to making the tale memorable and realistic.\n\nThis book almost tastes like a Jules Verne novel in its adventure and setting - albeit 20,000 leagues above the sea rather than under it.  Victorian-style ladies and gents bedecked in top hats and feathers are imaginatively mixed in with high-tech science and the \"could-of-been\"s of a Wright brothers-free world.  Through the mysterious, flying cloud-cats, he blends in hints of his previous, unrelated, novels about bats.  He even goes as far as to explain how the cloud-cats could have flown if they were real.\n\nRealistic characters and a fully-imagined world sweep the story into a level of literature that few novels achieve.  The main characters, Kate and Matt, are multi-dimensional, flawed products of their made-up existence, faced with real-life problems and making understandable mistakes.  They are almost perfect counterpoints - one a poor sailor with a path and a dream, the other a rich know-it-all with the wind at her heals.  Their world, although fantasy, is so well envisioned and communicated by the author that readers can easily picture the story in their minds-eye, and get pulled into the twisting plot with a vengeance.\n\n I strongly recommend this book to anybody who likes to try something a little new.

He is as comfortable climbing the struts and catwalks in the airship Aurora as a monkey in a jungle. When a balloonist in distress is spotted in the vicinity of the Aurora, Captain Walken takes advantage of Matt's light weight and agility to help reel the stranded balloon onto the Aurora. A critically ill old man, rescued from the balloon, is taken to the ship's infirmary. When Matt visits him, the man asks him if he saw \"them\" and describes some heretofore unknown winged creatures.\n\nOn the Aurora's next voyage, Matt meets an adventurous young lady, Kate de Vries, who is on a mission to find these mysterious winged creatures. The old man in the balloon was her grandfather. He left a logbook behind that described the creatures and pinpointed their location. When pirates attack the airship, events are set into motion that put Matt and Kate into life altering experiences.\n\nKenneth Oppel has created a high-spirited, swashbuckling adventure.

Davidson","reviewText":"Once upon a time, it was still questionable whether the blimp or the airplane would come to dominate the skies.  The airplane won, of course, but not before the blimps' fans had produced a fair amount of dirigible-centered science fiction, perhaps most notably Rudyard Kipling's \"With the Night Mail.\"  Kenneth Oppel brilliantly resurrects this previously deceased branch of sf with Airborn, which is reminiscent of boys' adventure serials like Great Marvel, as well as the works of Jules Verne, Rudyard Kipling, and perhaps most importantly, Robert Louis Stevenson.\n\nTo make this world of airships possible, these stories often optimistically imagined gasses lighter than hydrogen.  Oppel invents such a gas for the world of Airborn and playfully labels it \"hydrium,\" adding in a super-light, super-strong material called alumiron.  The precise era of this fantasy world is uncertain, of course, because it is a projected future of the Victorian age rather than a past or future of the real world.  The impressive technology of the airships and ornithopters is blended with an old-fashioned decor, communication technology, and admirable chivalry.  Though science fiction is typically used to envision the future, Oppel taps its other major ability, one that has in recent days come increasingly to the fore:  it's ability to re-imagine the past.\n\nAirborn, like the great boys' adventure that it is, has all the well-known elements.  The protagonist is a plucky, self-capable, likeable youth of the Stevenson variety.  The story features the ravings of an eccentric scientist on his death bed, the appearance of his comely granddaughter, pirates, narrow escapes, final confrontations, and swashbuckling in the grand tradition of swashbuckling.  Oppel's greatest achievement is not in merely moving these elements from the ocean to eight hundred feet above it, but in making the well-known plot points and characters immediate and fresh.  He carefully balances character, story development, and the technical details involved in flying an airship.  Whereas some of the early airship stories could bog down in descriptions of physics or weather, Oppel carefully cuts a straight path between the pitfalls of excessive exposition and excessive action sequences.  He has quite possibly produced today's Treasure Island, which is no small accomplishment.\n\nThis book is a great read.  Just don't read it in public or everyone will see the wide, unnerving grin it's likely to put on your face.","summary":"Thoroughly entertaining, high-flying adventure.","unixReviewTime":1116460800,"vote":null,"image":null}

I would have given you a flat-out No.  But Aiborn seems to be different.  Its unfolds as a Jules Verne novel, yes, (as many reviewers have said already) but seems to run by a different, and fresh, formula.  The writing is some of the best I've seen in a teen book.  Well-deserving of its' Printz award.\n\n  Matt Cruse plays the meager role of cabin boy around the AURORA, a futuristic half blimp\/half cruise ship.  But he doesn't mind.  He has found a home in the ship and feels isolated on land.  In short, life is good.  That is until he saves an elderly man from his sinking hot-air balloon.  Mystery enters around this point, when the old man asks Matt whether or not he has seen \"them\".  Matt, believing the man to be delirious, agrees that he has.  He reasons the man has seen an illusion, similar to the legend of the mermaid.  The old man is boarded on The Aurora, but dies later on, leaving Matt curious about \"them\".\n\n  Skip forward, one year later.  Matt is still cabin boy, but expects to be promoted to sailmaker soon.  A new trip is just around the corner and Matt is excited to be in the air again.  But, then, the sailmaking postion is filled by the son of Otto Lunardi's (the owner of the Aurora) son.  Matt, as you can imagine, is devastating, but stays on the ship, still thinking of it as his home.  But these events will soon be forgotten, when Matt meets the charming, rich, and beatiful Kate de Vries (accompanied by an escort, of course).  Ms, de Vries, as Matt insists on calling her, revives the mystery of the old man and the creatures he saw and takes him on a ride more exciting than any he's had on the Aurora.\n\n  Kenneth Oppel, known for is \"soaringly\" successful Silverwing Trilogy, has crafted yet another well-written novel about an unlikely hero.  Airborn may seem to be slow during the first chapter, but I dare you to read on.  You won't regret it.\n\n  R, your friendly neighborhood reviewer","summary":"Airborn","unixReviewTime":1115251200,"vote":5.0,"image":null}

Matt Cruse works as cabin boy n the Aurora--the airship his father had also served--before falling to his death. Matt wants nothing more than to stay in the air, become a sailmaker and eventually maybe even Captain. But the airship industry is changing. More and more, opportunity comes to academy graduates rather than to those who work their way up from the ranks. And Matt can't afford the academy or the loss of his paycheck that his family needs so badly.\n\nWhen Matt spots an errant hot-air balloon, he assumes an accident. But the ballooner's granddaughter, Kate de Vries, believes her grandfather's impossible writings about spotting a race of flying mammals--animals who never set foot on the ground. She boards the Aurora and befriends Matt.\n\nWhen the Aurora is boarded by pirates and damaged, Matt and the crew struggle to save her--but Kate is interested in her science and discovering the truth behind her grandfather's writings. Together, they face the horrors and wonders of the huge cloud-cats, and the frightful pirates.\n\nAuthor Kenneth Oppel writes a charming adventure. Matt, with his need to stay in the air to escape his fears, and Kate with her desire to become a scientist are both sympathetic young characters. The airships and Victorian manners give the story the sense of Jules Verne. AIRBORN targets the young adult market--and these readers will certainly enjoy the adventure and mild romance which develops between Matt and Kate. But AIRBORN will also appeal to adult SF readers who are looking for a fast-paced adventure story.","summary":"Charming and fast-paced adventure","unixReviewTime":1113782400,"vote":null,"image":null}

They are all really good friends, whose reviews I love. I was amazed that my opinion about this little book differed so much, and a bit nervous that I might tread on a few toes because it seems to be such a sentimental favourite. Then I remembered that when I first read it many years ago, I might have ranked it higher too, so maybe they're cruising on memory to some extent (sorry if that's you).\n\nThe story begins so grim, there's got to be a HEA (happily ever after) implied, because it can't get any worse. So far so good. I don't mind the direction from horrible to good. It's the opposite movement which gets rough, especially for kids' books.  It begins in India, where everyone dies a horrible, painful death of cholera, except for Mary Lennox, the neglected little girl who was ignored by her parents and basically brought up by slaves. She's found days later in the aftermath, and sent off to England to live under the roof of a cranky uncle, Mr Archibald Craven.\n\nFrom a modern perspective, there is lots of pious author intrusion. Burnett never missed the opportunity to drop in moralistic comments, such as 'Mary really was a disagreeable, self-centered and imperial child'. Yeah thanks, I think we get that idea without being told, but that was how some authors did things back then. You whack readers over their heads with your theme, just to be certain they don't miss it.\n\nYoung Colin's plight is seriously disturbing. A boy who has basically nothing wrong with him is left lying in bed for his first ten years, conditioned into hypochondria and believing he's going to die, because that's the line he's always taken on board from the adults. In all that time, he's never even attempted to walk because he believes there's no point. He rarely, if ever, leaves his bedroom. And he's never been outside in his life. Yet they just mumble insulting things about him beneath their breath (which he overhears) and kowtow to his face because he's the master's son, and they have to observe their ridiculous social pecking order.\n\nBurnett kept calling Mary a hard, unloving little girl, and Colin a cantankerous, sickly boy who believed he was going to die, as if this was all their own fault. Come on, they were ten-year-old kids, and the incompetent adults shaped them this way, by the way they treated them. Mary wasn't given an ounce of love by her parents in India, yet she's expected to show love and be a normal cheesy child in her new home. Where do they expect her to pull that from? And Colin is always told, 'Lie down and take it easy, my boy,' and never, 'Why don't you lean on my arm and come to the window seat for some sunshine?' Then they have the nerve to complain about him throwing the occasional tantrum.\n\nWhen Mary and Colin end up proving that neither of them are really the monsters the adults turned them into, nobody thinks to say, 'Whoops, our bad.' I never expected to feel so angry reading this for the second time. Talk about indulging in forms of child abuse, then blaming the children for their own perceived shortcomings. It's a horror story, in a way.\n\nGood on Mary and Colin, for taking matters into their own hands. I've come across people who have criticized kids' books for what they call 'glorifying disobedience', even when the young heroes end up saving the day (take Harry Potter stories, and other more modern ones). The same thing happens in The Secret Garden, from the moment Mary decides to investigate the strange sound of crying for herself. The adults deserved to have their authority flouted, because they consistently made the dumbest decisions. Why keep Mary and Colin apart from each other in the first place? And why the heck didn't anyone ever think to introduce Colin and boy wonder Dickon to each other earlier, since they lived in the same vicinity? The adults are the baddies here, and there's no two ways about it.\n\nAnother thing I must have overlooked during my first read through as a kid was Frances Hodgson Burnett's strong metaphysical agenda in the writing of the story. She has Colin deciding to chant, 'Magic is in me, magic is making me well.' When the children discuss this together, he says, 'Perhaps the beginning is just to say nice things are going to happen until you make them happen.' And there are several similar quotes, particularly thick toward the end. Some readers might throw around terms like white magic, spells, incantations, self-reliance and sorcery. Whether or not you buy into all that, it comes across as if she's elevating the human mind and giving kids the message that they're totally in control of their destiny. If they only think enough good thoughts, these will transform their life circumstances and make things wonderful. That's a bit dodgy and limited however you want to look at it.\n\nThere are a few nice, heartwarming parts about enjoying the garden, but not enough to make up for all that I just ranted about. The crocuses, snowdrops, lilies, jonquils, narcissus, jasmine and daffodils (or daffydowndillies) get good mentions. My favourite part is when Ben Weatherstaff, the gruff old gardener, chokes up with emotion when his friend, the robin (the real hero of the story in my opinion) decides to honour him by landing on the handle of his shovel.

Kids will enjoy the pleasant story while taking particular interest in some of Barklem's more impressive drawings.  Her elaborate Rube Goldbergesque illustrations of the Dairy Stump and Mill are delightful.  There is an attention to detail in these books that does not go unnoticed.

Rowling should be jealous). Books with magic in are slowly tending to become more technological (as our technology becomes more magical, perhaps, or maybe it's just because of games in which magic has to be \"balanced\"); there are clear rules for what can and can't be done. This author was writing before that trend, or ignored it, and her magic is like the magic of folktales. It works because it ought to work, because having it work that way is cool.\n\nShe was also writing before \"head-hopping\" (switching between third-person viewpoints in the middle of a scene) became so denigrated, and a couple of times it's disorientating. Her style is the simple, declarative style of books for younger readers, but there's nothing wrong with that, though if I'd been her editor I would have said \"show, don't tell\" a couple of times and suggested more active phrasings for a few sentences. The writing, in other words, isn't flawless, but the story, the characters and especially the world make up for it.\n\nThe main viewpoint character is a boy known as Cat, for reasons that, when explained, turn out to be very important. He's afflicted with a sister named Gwendolen, who is as self-centred as a gyroscope and reacts badly to being thwarted, causing a cascade of trouble for poor Cat. By the middle of the book he's in not just one, but four or five bad situations, with no solution in sight, and all of them are Gwendolen's fault.\n\nThe secondary characters are delightful. The powerful Chrestomanci, in particular, with his beautiful clothes, is like a less self-centred Howl, but each one of them has some characteristic of appearance or mannerism that makes them distinct and memorable.\n\nThis is the first of a series of six books, and I'll be reading the others too, I think.","summary":"Memorable characters, fun world","unixReviewTime":1389830400,"vote":null,"image":null}

Jones","reviewText":"\"Charmed Life\" is my first Diana Wynne Jones book (I know, I know ... I'm a little late) and I'll openly admit I came to her work through Miyazaki's amazing film \"Howl's Moving Castle\".  Imagine how stupid I felt when I realized that I had been missing out on one of the best writers of our age. While it starts off slowly, Jones's first Chrestomanci book is still a grand, magical, yet simple adventure that sweeps the reader off their feet into a quirky yet solid world that readers will enjoy again and again.\n\nEric, a.k.a., Cat Chant, is a small and passive boy who thinks that he has no magical powers unlike his sister Gwendolen.  Gwendolen is an ambitious, spoiled, and powerful girl who dreams of controlling the world. One day, when their parents die in a tragic boat accident, Gwendolen's powers attract the attention of the dapper and eccentric Chrestomanci.  Chrestomanci is an enchanter, and a nine lived one at that, so that means he controls and governs all magic in the twelve related worlds.  Chrestomanci seems to take an interest in Gwendolen, so he invites her and Cat to live in his castle.\n\nWhen they arrive at the castle, both children dislike it at first.  But Cat, being the passive boy that he is, quickly makes friends with Chrestomanci's two children even though he's absolutely frightened to death of their father. But Gwendolen has other ideas.  She hates the fact that she has to learn maths and history instead of magic in school, and she is absolutely appaled that Chrestomanci doesn't take notice in her powers. Soon, Gwendolen sets out on a war of wills and magic against Chrestomanci and his castle, and Cat is unbeknowingly caught up in the whirlwinds of his sister's dangerous ambitions.\n\nJones is brilliant in her prose and writing.  She easily writes with a sense of whimsy, while at the same time fleshing out realistic characters and villains.  Cat is passive at first, but he soon grows a spine and stands up against the one thing that holds him back (I won't ruin the surprise).  Jones' magic is an everyday and casual part of life for the characters, but it comes in second to their emotions and the overall story. The story takes so many surprising twists that shocked and surprised me, I was literally biting my nails towards the end wondering what would happen next.\n\n\"Charmed Life\" is a delightful and charming surprise. While not a grand and sweeping epic, it will still sweep readers off their feet with the simple and quiet humor, magic, and sheer enjoyment that Jones so evidently finds and puts into her work. This book is not to be missed, and I can only end with saying how foolish I feel now that I didn't find Diana sooner.","summary":"A Charmed Surprise ...","unixReviewTime":1152835200,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

This is fantasy at its best, well written and very inventive, with characters that seem both familiar and bizarrely unique. It is, I suppose, not life-changing fiction but it keeps you there and makes you care and gives an opportunity to wonder. (It is no accident that Hayao Miyazaki based his latest film - Howl's Moving Castle -- on one of Jones' novels: they seem to have imaginations that operate on the same wavelength; like him, she is endlessly inventive and capable of a sublime blending of the supernatural and the ordinary, and loves finding magic in machines, and has an obsession with cats.)\n\nThe basic premise of the \"Chrestomanci multiverse\" is that every time there is a major event that \"changes\" the world, the world actually divides into two alternate realities, one in which the event occurs and one in which it doesn't. Somehow, though, while the possibilities might seem infinite there are a limited number of possibilities that resemble the one Chrestomanci inhabits enough to warrant his general attention and concern. Within each major world variation, there are nine alternates (don't ask why just nine) that are apparently unified because they have the \"same\" people doing different things in them. It sometimes happens, though, that an individual within one of those realities has no parallel in the others, and so the \"lives\" that would belong to the other realities actually belong to him or her. Such a nine-lived individual has powerful magic and becomes a likely candidate for taking over the position of the British-hired Chrestomanci (think a mixture of Rowling's Minister of Magic for an indication of his range of responsibilities, with Head of Hogwarts for his overall competency).\n\nSpeaking of Rowling, some have compared Jones to Rowling and there are some interesting parallels -- so many that it is hard not to think that Rowling had at least read some of Diane Wynne Jones' stories. Still, I don't agree with others who say Jones is a better writer than Rowling. There is a way in which she is: for her elegance of prose, her compactness of style, for the overall simplicity and completeness of her stories. Still, I think that Rowling is superior because what Jones doesn't try to do Rowling does very well. Jones creates another world whose basic features are similar to ours, but is different in specifiable ways. In that sense it is pure fantasy, a work of the imagination that she can tinker with and alter in various stories but is basically self-contained and organized in such a way that each story can be really complete. Rowling fits her story of another world into THIS world and sets herself with what seems to me a much more difficult task of accommodating her fantasy to the unknown and improbable and strange and unfinished character of any story set in this real world. The edges in any such story are unwieldy and it is a real tribute to Rowling (though in no way a criticism of Jones who has other aims) that she can wield them so well.","summary":"A wonderful beginning to an exciting series","unixReviewTime":1128384000,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

Fisher","reviewText":"Out of all of Diana Wynne Jones's novels, \"Charmed Life\" is possibly her most famous, and her most read. It is the first published of her Chrestomanci novels, and it stars many of her most famous characters with her requisite twisting plot and quirky sense of humour. Set in a parallel world ripe with magic, wizards and magical creatures, DWJ's \"Chrestomanci\" quartet were clearly inspirational to J. K. Rowling in her creation of Hogwarts and her wizarding world - a lot of comparisons can be made between the two. Ultimately \"Harry Potter\" is the deeper and more intricate series, but DWJ's novels are stand-alone, can be read out of order, and are rich in detail and cleverness.\n\nGwendolyn Chant is an extraordinarily gifted witch, despite the fact that her little brother Cat has no magical ability at all. After their parents' deaths, the two orphans are taken in by Mrs Sharp amongst a neighbourhood of magical folk - but Gwendolyn has bigger plans for herself that concern nothing less than the conquering of the world. When the two of them are taken to Chrestomanci Castle, Gwendolyn is delighted - Chrestomanci is a powerful enchanter that she feels sure will teach and guide her on her way to world domination.\n\nBut things are not quite as she expected - Chrestomanci has no desire whatsoever to make this young witch even more powerful before she gains a little self-control. With the added restrictions of their tutor Mr Saunders and Chrestomanci's family watching her every move, Gwendolyn has had quite enough - she begins to wage war on Chrestomanci.\n\nFrom there things only begin to get uglier, as Chrestomanci gets more and more stubborn and Gwendolyn becomes more and more frustrated. Stuck in the middle is Cat, desperately loyal to his sister but just as eager to fit in with his new family. Gwendolyn's plans are even deeper than expected, with secret trips to dodgy black marketeers and a hidden source of magic that even Cat is unaware of...\n\nFunny, heartfelt, realistic, imaginative and sometimes even a little grotesque, \"Charmed Life\" is one of a work of true children's literature. The characters are vivid, the storyline intriguing, and the morals sincere without being too heavy-handed. Some components are a little complicated: DWJ sprinkles hints and clues throughout the book and some of these are hard to remember - but all of that simply justifies a second reading to pick up the things you missed!\n\nChrestomanci himself is a gem - think for a moment of all the famous wizards in literature. You're almost certainly thinking: Merlin, Gandalf, Dumbledore (and if you're rather well-read, Dallben, Merriman Lyon and Cadellin) What do all these wizards have in common? - they're old, wizened, sage-like and immensely wise. Chrestomanci turns this tired stereotype around on its head - he's handsome, well-dressed, reasonably young and quite infuriating at times! Plus, if you've already read \"The Lives of Christopher Chant\", the name of Chrestomanci's wife may make you smile...\n\nIn typical DWJ fashion, the story does not end on a perfectly upbeat note - in fact it's rather sad, with only a trembling sort of hopefulness in our main character that will induce readers to seek out other Chrestomanci books: \"Witch Week\", \"The Magicians of Caprona\", \"The Lives of Christopher Chant\" and \"Mixed Magics\" - an anthology of short stories.","summary":"\"When was a Chant Ever Normal?\"","unixReviewTime":1105488000,"vote":4.0,"image":null}

Bird","reviewText":"I don't think there's a children's author living today that has as great a grasp on twist endings as Ms. Diana Wynne Jones.  Jones has the dubious honor of being my current favorite fantasy writer for children and teens (aside from J.K. Rowling, I suppose).  Her collected stories contain more whimsy and wit in a single paragraph than 98% of the adult books on the market today, let alone those for the kiddies.  \"Charmed Life\" is the first in the collected Chrestomanci novel series.  A witty tale of a brother and is magical sister, the book is pure Jones and as fresh as if it was written yesterday.\n\nCat and his sister Gwendolen were the only survivors of the fatal boat crash that drowned both their parents and a host of innocent civilians.  Now on their own, Gwendolen is turning out to be an incredibly competent young witch.  Cat, for his part, isn't magical in the least and is perfectly content to stick by Gwendolen at all times.  When a mysterious relative by the name of Chrestomanci comes to take the two to his home, Gwendolen (spoiled with a nasty sense of entitlement) thinks she's about to be realized as the genius sorceress she truly is.  She's in for a nasty surprise as Chrestomanci and his large extended family treat her as normally as possible.  When Gwendolen's pranks for attention go too far, Cat finds that her schemes might well upset the balance of magic in the world.  Worse, she may not be the beloved sister he really needs.\n\nThis story has all sorts of tiny magical details and sly spots throughout it.  In many ways it's a book more similar to Harry Potter than most.  Of course, \"Charmed Life\" originally was published in 1977 so there's little question of who may have influenced whom.  The characters are, of course, great.  Jones has always excelled at writing truly awful children.  Real remarkably spoiled brats.  Gwendolen is a perfect example of this.  She's stuck-up, cruel, and not a very good sister.  Cat, for his part, is completely passive.  He lets Gwendolen do whatever she wants whenever she wants it, and even goes so far as to miss her when she unexpectedly disappears halfway through the book.  Chrestomanci himself is a huge departure from the stereotypical wise wizard.  He has a very nice wife and two slightly overweight (but likable once you get to know them) children.  He's a spiffy dresser and not particularly old.  I doubt that there are many like him in the fantasy wizard world.\n\nIf there's a flaw with the book, it's that the reader has a hard time suspending disbelief at times.  Once Cat finds himself in terrible trouble, he refuses to consult with Chrestomanci.  The reasons for this are weak and somewhat confusing.  Also, Chrestomanci himself is also prone to not explaining himself.  He has a particularly weak reason for this as he explains at the end of the novel, making many of the plot points somewhat hard to believe at times.\n\nOtherwise, the book's a pip.  If you've already discovered Diana Wynne Jones, this one should certainly not disappoint.  If you've never encountered her before, this is an excellent place to start.  It's witty and well-written and full of particularly enjoyable characters and situations.  There's enough imagination in this puppy to tide you over for quite some time.  A true Jones creation.","summary":"A Cat of many lives","unixReviewTime":1099526400,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

Too many folks insist on easy-to-categorize books for younger readers, and hers are anything but easily categorized.\nCharmed Life was one of the first Jones novels I read, and it remains one of my favorites. In a Britain very close to our world's Britain, but with the rather important difference of magic-users being commonplace rather than legendary, a mild-mannered young boy named Cat is coping with his aggressively-talented sister, his orphan state, his left-handedness...and his process of self-discovery is a wild ride and a wonderful read.

This particular tale starts off very slow, but rapidly turns into a magical adventure at Chrestomanci's castle.\nGwendolen and Cat Chant lose their parents in a tragic paddleboat accident, and end up having to live with a mildly talented local witch. But it soon becomes evident that though Cat has no magical powers, Gwendolen has enough for several people. She's so powerful and skilled, in fact, that she attracts the interest of Chrestomanci, who has her and Cat brought to his castle. But then things start to deteriorate. Gwendolen is an arrogant, spoiled girl who seems to think that since she has magic, she isn't restricted by the same rules as the others. She isn't allowed to do magic, pick the plants, mouth off to Chrestomanci's kids or the teachers, she has to do math and ordinary lessons. Gwendolen finds that Chrestomanci, not her, is the ruler of the castle -- and she doesn't like that at all. (Oh yeah -- she also wants to rule the world) Cat likes being at the castle, is intimidated by Chrestomanci, and likes hanging out with Chrestomanci's two kids.\nSo she starts off on a one-witch campaign to make Chrestomanci notice and respect her: She infests the lawn with moles, causes apparitions in the windows, giant earthworms, fighting stained glass windows -- and then propels herself into another world, leaving her double with Cat. Cat must learn more about himself, his hidden power, and gain Chrestomanci's help before things get even worse.\nThis book starts off slowly -- the first twenty pages are pretty dull, chronicling the background of Cat and Gwendolen and how they came to live with Mrs. Sharp. Not very magical. But things pick up as soon as Chrestomanci comes into the picture, and the magical goings-on are sprightly and delightful.\nAs always, Jones shows great insight into kids' minds: Though Cat seems a little too passive at first, kids will like him, as they will the calm Roger and Julia. People who've read \"Lives of Christopher Chant\" will also see a familiar face in Chrestomanci's wife Milly. Chrestomanci is, as always, dapper and intelligent and cool-headed and thoroughly enjoyable.\nThough this book is compared to Harry Potter, it's superior in every way. Jones never tries to dazzle us with wow-isn't-that-amazing? magic, and her jokes never descend to low humor -- for example, the dueling stained glass windows, and the earrings that scream \"I BELONG TO CAROLINE CHANT!\" so they'll never get lost. As this is another world where magic is prevalent over science (due to different events long ago), the magic is more casual. There is also respect for authority figures (Chrestomanci); kids who don't save the world entirely on their own, but do play a pivotal part in it; and her villains aren't bad just because they ARE: Gwendolen is merely a brat with magical powers.\nThis is a delightful fantasy book for all ages, especially for kids who feel oppressed by their siblings.

A little later I discovered The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, but for about 20 years those were to only fantasy books I had read.\nThen, three years ago the Harry Potter era started in our family. And now we live in a Harry Potter world here. But, in spite of all the pages a Harry Potter book doesn't last forever. It was with great pleasure that we some time ago opened my daughter's birthday gift and found the series The Worlds of Chrestomanci. They are perfect while waiting for the next Harry Potter to come, and perfect when you want something to read :-)\nThe first book in the series is Charmed life. It tells the story of Eric Chant, known as Cat, and his older sister Gwendolen. Cat and Gwendolen's parents dies in a boat accident, and all Cat have is his older sister. She is a witch, and Cat adores her. They first live with an old woman in the town, but it soon shows that Gwendolen has a very special talent for witchcraft, and to their joy they are asked for to come and live with the great Chrestomanci in his castle. Their life in his castle is not like the two kids expected, and Gwendolen, the witch, takes the easy way out and runs off to another world, Cat has to stay and fight his way through the days.\nThe novel is filled with fantasy and unexpected events. And it never let you get bored. The book is meant for young readers, and any booklover between 9-12 will love it. I even think any book lover between 9 and 99 will. Try the book, and you will be so charmed by it you just need the others in the series as well.\nIs it magic? Who knows......\nBritt Arnhild Lindland","summary":"Fantasy, wonderful fantasy.","unixReviewTime":1000771200,"vote":10.0,"image":null}

It's prefectly obvious why, she's a very powerful witch. And ever since the two sibling's parents died Cat has clung to her every day. And when he's sent to llive with Mrs. Sharp, all she wants to do is nourish Gwendolyn's gift. But when there sent to live with the fabled Chrestomanci Gwendolyn is more or less put in her place. SHe is not allowed to pratice witchcraft. SO she sets up into proving the Chrestomanci wrong and porving that she is the most powerful one of them all. But Cat know's what his sister is capable of and when she dose something so powerful, he's the one who has to fix it.\nLike many people I found the title of this book on a online list called \"what to read after Harry Potter.\" When I read this I was very entertained. Cat's story is thrilling and suspenceful. I reccomend this book to fans of fantasy books such as Harry Potter and\/or Tamora Pierce. Though it's not as good as JK Rowling's creations it's definatly a novel any fantasy lover should put in their collection. I'm planning on reading the other four novels in the series too. Read it you won't be dissapointed.","summary":"An emtertaining story","unixReviewTime":990230400,"vote":3.0,"image":null}

Cat and his sister, Gwendolyn, are now living in a vast and immense Castle, Chrestomanci Castle. Gwendolyn herself is a witch, and though she's quite a good one, she gets angry quite easily -- a darkness brews inside her that she can't control, and her spells are powerfully dangerous. When she is angry over the rules she has to put up with in Chrestomanci's Castle, she begins to conjure up many schemes to get rid of Chrestomanci himself once after all. Cat doesn't know how to stop his devious , stronger sister -- already she's gaining to much power, and goodness knows what she can do with her witchcraft ! Cat needs to somehow be brave , but he doesn't have magic in his own blood. That's why it would take more then human powers to stop Gwendolyn's evil ! From magical schemes to destroy everything Gwendolyn despises to a talking upset Dragon who's blood is wanted to a charmed pair of diamond earings that can never get lost by constantly screaming, 'I belong to Caroline Chant!' , Charmed Life is a hilarious and delightfully enjoyable novel that sparks an excellent written expression and humor, never failing to amuse but offer a good scare just as well. Dianna Wynne Jones has written a very charming novel.","summary":"Charmed Life : A hilariously charming novel.","unixReviewTime":984182400,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

She ranks right up there with Lloyd Alexander and Philip Pullman.  The intelligence and creativity of her work is  consistently remarkable, and Charmed Life is a wonderful example of the  scope of her imagination and plots.\n Charmed Life, an entry in the  Chrestomanci series (which can be read in any order without any knowledge  of the others--others include Witch Week, The Lives of Christopher Chant,  The Magicians of Caprona), is a charming British YA fantasy that far  predates the Harry Potter mania.  Fans of Harry Potter might like this; it  has a similar enough plot--young orphaned boy with awful relatives is taken  to a place where his talents can begin to expand.  Young Eric, familiarly  known as Cat, even slides around on magic mirrors (as opposed to magic  broomsticks).  However, Charmed Life is in every way superior to the Harry  Potter books.  For instance, the world's concept is much more profound and  interesting.  The world Cat inhabits is one in which magic abounds and  technology is a bit backward-- not this world as we have known it at any  point in time.  Rather, it's a version of our world had key events been  changed.  (For example, a possible alternate world would be if Napoleon had  succeeded in his campaigns.  We would probably live in a world with a  primary language of French.)  Secondly, again unlike the HP books, there  are no completely evil characters.  Diana Wynne Jones has a talent for  creating idiosyncratic, realistic people, and even those who are...less  than wonderful, have their moments of niceness.  And even the 'nice' people  have their faults.  Good doesn't always automatically win, and Cat is  hardly a faultless protagonist.\n Diana Wynne Jones takes common themes  and imbues them with so much life and color and humor that the result--  Charmed Life (among many others) is compulsively likable.  Who else could  successfully mix enchanters, shrieking furniture, violin-turned-cats,  maid-turned-frogs, silverware, family mysteries, alternate worlds,  adventure and wit save a master magician such as Diana Wynne Jones?  If you  haven't read anything by her but like your fantasies good and British with  dizzyingly intricate plots, do try her work.  I particularly recommend  Howl's Moving Castle, Hexwood, and, of course, Charmed Life.  These are  books that deserve to be read...and reread...and reread...\n Ailanna","summary":"Perfectly charming","unixReviewTime":961200000,"vote":37.0,"image":null}

In fact, we can still quote it by heart.\n\nThe book is really just a list of things that start with the letter B, but the Berenstains have managed to create a story that's a lot of fun with it.  We follow the results when a bear, a bull, and a baboon blow bubbles and bike backwards.  What happens?  Well, they bump into all kinds of things.  And the more they bump, the more absurd the book gets and the more fun it truly is.\n\nAs I said, we all loved this book.  It was clever and charming and so out there you can't help but laugh at it.  Each page pretty much repeats what came before while adding a new layer to the chaos.  And the illustrations capture what is happening perfectly.\n\nThis is a true classic picture book.  If you can find a copy, you're family will love it.","summary":"Your Kids Will Be Bouncing to Read This Book Again","unixReviewTime":1330300800,"vote":2.0,"image":null}

I brought home a school book order in which she found a boxed set of the  Chronicles of Narnia and ordered them for me,  despite the fact that I had never heard of them. The day they came, I was fascinated by the  elaborate case and covers, and I couldn't wait to go home from school and begin reading.  Opening \"The Lion, the Witch, and The Wardrobe\", I began a marathon reading session that lasted until Mom called me for supper, and a love affair with  Narnia that will last the rest of my life.  What a wonderful gift Mr. Lewis gave the world with  these books.  I have tried several times to figure out which book I like best, but I have never  arrived at a suitable answer.  For me, all seven books seem to run together as one great, beautiful story.  Every so often (very often), it is wonderful to escape into a world of kings and queens, fauns and dwarves, dryads and dragons.  To finish, I can only say, \"Thanks, Mom.  You have never steered me wrong!\"","summary":"Thank you, Mom!","unixReviewTime":887846400,"vote":null,"image":null}

I've since set about to rectify this... and while I found \"The Horse and His Boy\" decent but not as good as the others, \"Prince Caspian\" has proved to be a delightful adventure, a worthy continuation of the Narnia series that continues the adventures of the Pensieve children and the alternate world they've come to see as their own.\n\nFor the four Pensieve siblings -- Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy -- it's been a year since they left Narnia, and they're setting off to London for boarding school and largely forgetting about their adventures.  But a mysterious force whisks them back to Narnia... a Narnia much changed from how they remember it.  For hundreds of years have passed since the Pensieves left Narnia, and their beloved land has been overrun by an invading nation that has chased the talking beasts and fantastic creatures of the land away.  And among these fugitive creatures is Caspian, a human prince who is the rightful heir to the Narnian throne but must first wrest it away from his usurping uncle.  Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy must join forces with Caspian -- joined by a skeptical dwarf named Trumpkin and an enthusiastic warrior-mouse named Reepicheep -- and help him reclaim his throne... and save Narnia from a tyrant.\n\nJust like the earlier books, I enjoy C. S. Lewis' conversational style in these books, and the way he addresses the reader as if he were telling a story around a campfire instead of just writing a book.  This tone can be hard to pull off and can result in some serious missteps if not handled correctly, but I never found it annoying or distracting as I read.  And Lewis has a knack for weaving descriptions into the story that paint vivid pictures without bogging the story down in unnecessary purple prose, and conveying grand emotions without delving into the melodramatic.\n\nAfter a detour away from the Pensieve family in \"The Horse and His Boy,\" it was nice to be reunited with them again in this book.  It's been especially nice to see how they've changed and progressed since \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,\" especially Edmund, who has learned from his mistakes in previous books and matured into a finer, wiser young man.  Prince Caspian is a newcomer but not an unwelcome one, a young man striving to find his own place and struggling with the sudden weight of responsibility, and both Trumpkin and Reepicheep provide some snarky comic relief along the way, yet are loyal companions and fighters as well.  The villains are a bit one-dimensional, but that's not uncommon for a Narnia book...\n\nA fine entry in the Narnia series, \"Prince Caspian\" is definitely a must-read if you enjoyed \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.\"  It's a fine return to characters we grew to love in the first book, and a splendid adventure in one of the most famous worlds in fantasy literature.","summary":"Splendid sequel to a beloved children's classic","unixReviewTime":1512950400,"vote":null,"image":null}

One of the very first books I actually became interested in reading was The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe after my parents bought it for me as a kid. True, this may seem like it appeals to a younger, more childish, audience, but there is way more to it than any old work of Fantasy.\n\nThere are two different ways to read this series, in the chronological order or the order that they were published. I began in the order they were published and didn't even read the very first book, a prologue of sorts, until many years later.\n\nThe series begins with the Pevensie family, a group of four children who have been sent away from London so that they can be safe from the World War II bombings. Once at the house theyve been sent to, the youngest of the siblings, Lucy, discovers the magical land of Narnia hidden away in a wardrobe that can be quite pesky, only allowing entrance to the land at certain moments, and convinces her siblings Peter, Susan, and Edmund to come with her.\n\nI would without a doubt classify Lewis as one of the best writers of the 20th century. He has a way of telling the story in a brilliant manner. Though at times the different wording can be a slight distraction (it was written a while ago in England after all), the imagery he uses and the allusions abound in the series.\n\nIts no real surprise that the story portrayed in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a fictionalized account of the death of Christ. If you know your Bible tales well enough, its easy to pick out. Lewis was quite the devout Christian, and was very gifted in the area of storytelling. As the series does deal with the Biblical stories, there are a lot of themes paralleling those in the Bible. Forgiveness, belief in God, family, and more all all found within the pages.\n\nOverall, there is a lot of things to like about this series. It is a prime example of detailed world-building. Lewis had to create a world completely different from our own, not a futuristic one that resembles ours, but a separate world entirely. They have their own customs and people groups, there are fauns, centaurs, talking horses, the whole range of mythical creatures.\n\nI would highly recommend the Narnia series, but this one specifically. Whether you're five, fifteen, twenty-five, or fifty, the magical tales are enrapturing, and a very good read.","summary":"This series was one that I pretty much grew up on","unixReviewTime":1501372800,"vote":null,"image":null}

If you were familiar with any of the Narnia series, either in book form or movie, then you would understand that the series is an allegory of the life of Christ (Lion Witch and the Wardrobe) and how His message affects Christians in their earthly journey. Well, \"The Last Battle\" is an allegory of the battle at the end of the Thousand year reign of Christ, and the recreation of heaven and earth at the end of the book of Revelations. It is C. S. Lewis' view of the falling of the stars out of the heavens and the destruction of the earth by fire that makes phenomenal reading.. As allegories go, Lewis is able to destroy Narnia as he envisions the destruction of heaven and earth and the creation of a new heaven and new earth, which is not boring at all. It allegorically explains who the opposition to the rule of Aslan is, and the kind of deceptions  the anti-Christ and false prophet.will use to woo people to unbelief.

McEvoy","reviewText":"I have read this book, and series about a dozen times over the last 30 years. But this past winter my son who was in grade 3 brought it home from school. Sitting at the table after school he read almost the entire first chapter to me and his little sister. He only needed help with some names. I was amazed and we read the whole book in just a few days. After that first reading we alternated pages as we read the book. I did not read this book until my first year of university and it is amazing to be reading it with my children.\n\nI know a number of people who do not like this book. But to be honest I love it. My son loved it also. Asking my son about what he liked best, he loved that a normal horse became a Pegasus, he loved that Digory Kirke on a number of occasions had to choose between an easy way and the right way and chose the right. He also really liked the adventure and even exploring of Digory Kirke and Polly Plummer. The themes in this book are similar to Lewis's Perelandra in that it is a new world and prior to a fall. But in this instance it is damaged and broken by the intrusion of people from our world.\n\nI always wondered why Polly only appears in 2 of the seven books in the series and yet Digory appears in 4. In some ways it seems like Polly was an afterthought. Polly only appears in the last two books in the publication order. Where Digory appears in the first, third, sixth , and seventh volumes. Though I must say Digory is one of my favorite characters, beaten out only by Aslan and Puddleglum, who we only encounter in The Silver Chair.\n\nThis book is an origin story. It tells us the beginnings of Narnia and also about the spaces between worlds or passages between them. It is a wonderful fantasy novel. The scene of the creation of Narnia is stunning and I am moved every time I read it. Since the first time I read it, I have hoped to happen upon a lamppost in the middle of a woods, and wonder just maybe.\n\nI have read the series in both the chronological order and in the publication order. My older box set has the books in the publication order, and the box set I bought for my son after reading this one has them in chronological order. I prefer reading it in publication order, but as mentioned am reading it with my children in chronological order.\n\nThis is a good read an part of an incredible series. And I am thankful my son brought it home and we started reading it together. It is so much more fun reading it with children.","summary":"Good book amazing series.","unixReviewTime":1499904000,"vote":null,"image":null}

Many times do I enjoy reading books after seeing the theatrical live action version of it to compare and differentiate between the two. This novel had about the same fast pace, amount of darkness and suspense that the film had. Obviously there is only so much they can do when making a film based off of a book to make it accurate.\n\n  That being said, there was much more focus on the character of Prince Caspian in this novel than in the film, that is usually something you 'd expect from books. I hope I won't get any backlash from book fans or even Narnia fans but I actually thought the movie was a lot more in depth than the books, not to mention had amazing action all throughout. Like I said before, you'd expect the contrary. The film contained more sequences to develop all the characters rather than just Prince Caspian, that is something the entire book focuses on most than anything else.\n\nIn my personal opinion, the film was a lot more in depth, but hey sometimes that is necessary to expand a little bit more than having your characters look one dimensional. Now I'm not gonna spend all my time saying negative points about it. The fourth installment in the Chronicles of Narnia series, Prince Caspian, thanks to the brilliance of C.S. Lewis, continues to bring the magic of Narnia to life right out of the pages.\nYou have all sorts of great characters in the novel that keep you at your seat's edge such as the Pevensie children, Caspian himself, the Majestic Aslan, Reepicheep, etc. and it makes you want to keep on going. For fans of the Chronicles of Narnia series or any fan of fantasy adventure novels, I'd highly recommend this novel for them because I know they'd enjoy it greatly.","summary":"A Great Novel","unixReviewTime":1487635200,"vote":null,"image":null}

Instead, some had gone wild, and it was hard to know if an animal wanted to talk to you - or kill you. Then Lucy said, \"Wouldn't it be dreadful if some day in our own world, at home, men started going wild inside, like the animals here, and still looked like men, so that you'd never know which were which?\"\n\nGood question.\n\n2: Not long later Lucy can see Aslan the Lion, but the rest of her company can't see Him. Aslan lets Lucy know they needed to go a different direction, but the company can't see Him, and they disagree. It just isn't the logical, safe way to go. So, they take a vote, and Lucy loses. Of course, their direction almost gets them killed, they change direction and Lucy gets to see Aslan again. That's when things take a surprising turn.\n\n\"For a long time she was so happy that she did not want to speak. But Aslan spoke. 'Lucy,' he said, 'we must not lie here for long. You have work in hand, and much time has been lost today.'\n\n'Yes, wasn't it a shame?' said Lucy. 'I saw you all right. They wouldn't believe me. They're all so---'\n\nFrom somewhere deep inside Aslan's body there came the faintest suggestion of a growl.\n\n'I'm sorry,' said Lucy, who understood some of his moods. 'I didn't mean to start slanging the others. But it wasn't' my fault anyway, was it?'\n\nThe Lion looked straight into her eyes.\n\n'Oh Aslan,' said Lucy. 'You don't mean it was? How could I--I couldn't have left the others and come up to you all alone, how could I? Don't look at me like that . . . oh well, I suppose I could. Yes, and it wouldn't have been alone, I know, not if I was with you. But what would have been the good?'\n\nAslan said nothing.\"\n\nThe illustrations of following Christ throughout the series are remarkable. Love it.\n\nThe Bad: This is CS Lewis. He doesn't write bad. But did he know how to quilt, or sweat copper pipe when he had a leak under the sink? I'm guessing not, and that makes me feel good. A man shouldn't be good at everything.\n\nThe Ugly: The truth at the  end of the above quote. It goes on to say,\n\n'\" You mean,m' said Lucy rather faintly, 'that it would have turned out all right--somehow? But how? Please, Aslan! Am I not to know?'\n\nTo know what would have happened, child?' said Aslan. 'No. Nobody is every told that.'\n\n'Oh dear,' said Lucy.\n\n'But anyone can find out what will happen,' said Aslan.\"\n\nAnd that is the beautiful truth.\n\ndanielcooley.com","summary":"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly","unixReviewTime":1486598400,"vote":null,"image":null}

After wearing out The Chronicles of Narnia by reading them over and over to our four kids - my kids bought me a new set at Christmas. Here is the new book one, which use to be book 4 or 5 or something. This is as confusing as Star Wars. Anyhow, here is the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.\n\nThe Good Quote: I liked the little section where Digory \"has the wild idea of saying [to Aslan] 'I'll try to help you if you'll promise to help my Mother,' but he realized in time that the Lion was not at all the sort of person one could try to make bargains with.\"\n\nSince Aslan is the Creator in this book, it was a great reminder not to think we can make bargins with God. We obey because He is, not to get.\n\nThe Bad: This is CS Lewis. He doesn't write bad. But I'm guessing he never even went 4-wheeling, and that makes me feel good. A man shouldn't be good at everything.\n\nThe Ugly: The Magician is ugly, and sad in the story. As Aslan says to Polly about the Magician, \"I cannot tell that to this old sinner, and I cannot comfort him either; he has made himself unable to hear my voice. If I spoke to him, he would hear only growlings and roarings.
